Date of travel: March 2022,10,Unbelievably bad,"We, the taxpayers, gave the airlines something like $5 billion to help them survive Covid. They treated us like dirt before, now they have plumbed new depths. Our outbound 8:00 AM flight in first class on a 737 was poor. The seats were not padded well, the video screen was tiny with poor clarity and the food, what little there was of it, was terrible.We've been traveling for more than 50 years and know the drill. The day of the return flight we were tracking the incoming plane all morning and there seemed to be a problem but Delta kept saying everything was fine except when it wasn't. At MBJ was had to stand in line for 75 minutes to check in for FIRST CLASS! They lied all day and eventually began saying our departure would be delayed. And they kept saying it until they canceled it. So we had to get our baggage and we were bussed to a very poor Holiday Inn. We were told to leave the hotel at 5:00 AM for a bus back to the airport where we had to wait in line for almost an hour, in an empty airport, to check in. The Delta and security people weren't there yet. No apologies. No food. Nothing. Then we had to wait until the 8:00 AM departure. Making us get there at 5:15 AM was the height of absurdity. Thoughtless.One final note. When you try to call Delta, you'll get a recording that says they'll call you back in TWO HOURS or so. They fired customer service staff and haven't brought them back. Unbelievable."
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Save your money,"I highly recommend you don’t upgrade to First Class on Delta domestic. For $100+ over business you get NO access to the Lounge, NO free Wi-Fi (just messaging and social media), a packet of crisps or a biscuit and a beverage, and a tiny bit more leg room. Very disappointing experience all round."
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Sickened by our experience,"I don't usually make post like this but I am absolutely SICKENED by the service we have received from Delta Airlines today. Leaving our home at 1 am to make it to the airport in st Louis early for the flight, my mom was greeted with a 1.5 hr wait at the bag check and ticket desk. She didn't even make it to security. Once they FINALLY addressed the 50+ people waiting in line, it was to tell them all that after their hour and a half wait the plane(s) had left without them. They stranded 50+ people at the airport. And when they told my mom the lady at the counter scoffed at her as if it had been her fault!I spent 7 hrs on the road this morning having to go back to pick her up after their failure. After contacting the chat online I was transfered to two different agents who told me three different stories. ( Yes you read that right ) Ultimately I was told I have to call in not use chat ( after 2 hrs of chatting ) and call in to receive a 4 hr wait time on hold! Stillllllll on hold. So here's one for you Delta Air Lines Today because of your horrific customer service:My mother was disrespected in public by your rude employee. I lost $75 worth of gasI lost $625 of potential income for the time I spent having to travel to and from unnecessarily due to your failureI put just short of 500 miles on my carMy mother will not get to go see her first grandchild until we receive your ""possible"" refund in at the earliest 7 business days.....too bad this week was the only time available in our family's schedule. So here's to you Delta. We will never fly with you again and will be sharing our story far and wide. You can bet on it!UPDATE: 4 hrs on hold and they closed for the night without answering my call.UPDATE: after holding a other hour and a half this morning to delta. We found out the lady at the airport didn't refund the ticket ! Also they will not make this right and said compensation or a new ticket voucher is not due to us."
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Worst Customer Service,"Deborah, the manager for delta in anchorage, is SUPER rude! After giving away my first class seat I specifically got because I’m traveling with a baby, Deborah threatened me because I raised my voice. She lied to me and kept referring to china! I’m not even Chinese and not traveling to china! She is prejudice and needs to be fired! I’m so hurt by this experience and can’t believe I fave such blatant prejudice from a delta airline manager! I’m so sick from it."
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Horrible everything.,"The airplane I rode in had rows of 3 seats in the middle and two seats on edges.  Each seat had a tv that you could watch stuff on.  The only problem is that mine was entirely broken and no one could fix it.  So I was forced to wait for an hour until the wi-fi was on, but even then the wi-fi didn’t even work.  I payed 30$ for the wi-fi and I could only use google.  I couldn’t watch anything on hulu, netflix and I could not use any social media at all.  I basically got scammed for 30$. 0/10 ride anything else besides delta."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Sky Miles BEWARE!!,"I have been building sky miles for a long time, but was unable to use so I wanted to transfer 30,000 miles to my daughter for a summer trip home.  First I tried contacting to make sure it  could be done, unfortunately an hour on hold and still no one.  Then I tried online help, 55 minutes later, never talked to anyone. So I searched the web site to see if it was possible to transfer sky miles, I did see that it’s possible, I filled out the wanted information, it said there would be a 30.00 fee and that’s understandable, but what wasn’t clear is that there would be the .01 per mile fee, because why in the world would anyone pay to give miles earned to someone?  I feel like it was totally meant to deceive a person. My daughter went online to help rectify the situation it and has been holding in one department or another for the last six hours!!!  this is not acceptable you got me this time, but I swear to you it’s the last!! That’s just not good business.  Try being up front about the penny per mile where it says payment!! That 30.00 dollar fee is meant to look as though that’s the cost to transfer."
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Their Staff is Terribly Unfriendly,"The staff are not friendly at all. The flight attendants all seem to be on a power trip regarding the mask situation. They will hover over you as you drink/eat to make sure you put your mask up as soon as the food or liquid hits your lips. If they have to tell you more than once, say goodbye. I saw them take a man off the plane although he had his mask on and was non-confrontational. Luckily, I did not have anything to eat or drink with me when I got on or I could have been with him. I understand that there are some unruly passengers, but Delta must understand that their staff is becoming unruly as well. I will never be using them again. Disgusting behavior by their staff. My colleagues and I travel often, and none of us will be using them ever again."
Date of travel: March 2022,20,Terrible customer service and help,"No refund even with travel insurance after a missed connection because of a delay and no flight for 11 hours later which was also delayed. I understand that things can go wrong like weather out of delta's control, however how they treat their customers during the struggles of travel nightmares was awful!! I wanted to document it because of how mind blowing rude and inappropriate they were!"
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Me,"Customer Service is worse than any cable company I've had to deal with!!! Wait time for customer service is nearly 5 hours!! They keep changing my flight with no regards to my connecting flight, which is also on Delta. I'm over it!!! Alaskan Airlines here we come....."
Date of travel: March 2022,40,Never had a bad experience,"I will always pay a bit extra if necessary to fly Delta. Their Comfort + class is very reasonably priced and provides the extra space I need with my bad knees. The few times a flight was delayed due to weather or mechanical problems they were very good about updating the passengers or getting us rebooked on other flights.I had to cancel several international flights over the past few years due to Covid, and customer service was great - refunded my money on one flight and let me move another with no penalties.Compared to most other US-based airlines, Delta is a real class act. There are a couple of international airlines -Qantas and British Airlines both come to mind - that I would tend to rate better, which is why only 4 stars. (If they can do it why can’t the US airlines). But delta really is head and shoulders above the others for domestic flights."
Date of travel: March 2022,50,Delta Airlines,"The flight from ATL to LGA is typically a 2 hr flight; however,  due to inclimate weather, we circled LGA for :30 + minutes then we were diverted to SYR, where the weather was just as bad. The pilot had to abort the first landing attempt due to wind sheer. Then, on the second attempt, there was another wind sheer warning, but we had to land due to the fact that we were extremely low on fuel. Actually, the landing was quite smooth considering the turbulents we were encountering (the captain must have been a NAVY pilot). Currently, we are waiting for the plane to be refueled so we can head back to LGA and HOPEFULLY land this time. All in all, we've been on the plane (flying and on the ground) for 4+ hours. I must say that Delta has been very apologetic and accommodating, considering this was an act of God and no fault of their own. Delta Airlines is absolutely amazing. I would and will not ever fly with another airline."
Date of travel: March 2022,20,Poor communication on Travel Delays,"So my sister booked a flight for travel today,. The airline wouldn’t offer any updates for 2-3 hours on the flight status. When the did announce to my sister she texted me to say the 9:55 pm flight was now 12:15 but the agent was wrong by 15 minutes. When I CALLED to communicate with an agent the system said my hold time would be 8 hours 50 minutes if I wished to wait for the next agent. What a wonderful way to run a multi-million dollar business."
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Delta is Ridiculous!!,"Our flight was canceled unbeknownst to us. Attempted to get another flight;however, none was available for today. I tried to contact customer support at 9:00 and received a 3 hour wait. Delta did not call me back until 4:45. I told him the issue as we missed work and had to obtain a new hotel. He told me he would take care of the issue but needed to put me on hold. It’s 6:00, and I am still on hold! I have never had this issue with Southwest!!!!! Ridiculous customer service."
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Don’t fly Delta,"Rude staff, paid for first class accommodations was move back to economy and the party was not even able to sit together some in the front and some  in the back horrible experience last time flying with Delta."
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Customer service.,Staff in general was rude from the gate to the attendants.  Customer service not good.  Gate agent was attempting to help people and check people in at the same time.  Couldn’t do either well.  Attendants were rude when people were trying to be helpful.
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Worst Experience,"I don’t think this space allows for all that I could complain about so I’ll sum it up and we havens made it to our destination.For a recent trip delta failed on every aspect of traveling… check in, gate communication, boarding/de boarding, customer service, rebooking missed flight due to delta operations.Awful."
Date of travel: March 2022,10,terrible ground personnel - bad experience,"This was a connecting flight for us [coming from barcelona (BCN)] -- The flight from BCN was a little late but the connecting time we has was more than one hour and our gate was not too far. However CDG is a horrible airport for connections. The passport control took way too long and we arrived at the gate exactly 7mn before departure time (10:25am) -- This is *before* not after departure time.  The staff member at the gate was rude and told us that the gate was closed and the plane is gone.  ``it is our rule to close the gate 20mn before the flight"" -- but they knew we were on our way and that the other plane had landed 1t 9:00am.  I could see 3 of us in the same situation.  The other person had a long flight from India and started crying at the way she was treated by the ground personnel.  I know CGD tends to be like this - travelers are treated like cattle  really. But I expected a little better from Delta. Air-France re-booked our flight though Washington Dullles. But then when I boarded the plane in Dulles my boarding pass was rejected (my wife's was OK) - and then it took forever for the staff (at least 15mn) to fix the issue [I have not clue what the issue was - they did not care to tell me]. I was about the last to board the plane.In any case here are my recommendations and comments if you go through CDG:* Avoid CGD and choose Amsterdam Schiphol if at all possible [I missed at least 3 connections in the past couple of decades in CDG and *none* in AMS. If you you have a short connection in AMS due to a delay the ground personnel would have you skip the line. I was in this situation a couple of times and it helps. In Paris they tell you ``you will be fine"" and essentially shut you up.* If you really have to go through CGD you need to plan for  at least 3h lay-over. [This  is a rule I use myself - but this time I thought this being a  low-season 2.5 hours were enough. Mistake]* Expect rude treatment from personnel whether French ground personnel or Delta. Sorry but that is the way it is if you need to use CDG. I have  seen some improvements in the last 3 decades or so that I have been traveling overseas - but they are still far behind AMS."
Date of travel: March 2022,20,Flying used to be nice…not anymore,"Delta wants to know how they could have made my trip better😂😂😂Stop packing people in like sardines. You can barely breathe. I don’t believe they aren’t making money—they just want to make more money.Make flight attendants nice again. Those on the plane were not friendly (only smiled when you boarded and left), and only communicated to tell people what not to do.Very unpleasant. Rules can be communicated better. Entertainment did not work entire flight—flight attendants were very clear NOT to blame them for this. SMDHI paid for “comfort plus” but value for $$$ definitely not there…not even close."
Date of travel: February 2022,30,First class is just not the same as it used to be!,"My husband and I were looking forward recently to our first class flight to Dallas.  Like a lot of people we hadn't traveled in a year.  We understand the pandemic has been hard on everyone especially the air line industry.  Our first class flight was such a disappointment.  The seats are comfortable and there is a small bottle of water.  Ok, they don't serve pre-boarding drinks but they don't serve much else either.  My breakfast was a screwdriver and banana bread in a box all served at the same time. The flight attendant did ask if I wanted another drink and near the end of the flight let us choose a snack from the snack basket.  Lame.  I really don't want to make best friends with the flight attendants and I do find it difficult to hear on a plane and with our masks it is even more difficult but a little social interaction goes a long way.  For the price we paid for a first class ticket, yes, I expected more.On the positive side it was an on time smooth flight and our bags are the first to come out and so we were on our way.Our first class return flight to Boston was mostly the same.  Our dinner was a ""cold"" I mean almost frozen cold, turkey sandwich with a bag of chips.  At least my drink came before my ""dinner in a box"" and the flight attendant was gracious enough to offer me several drinks  which I enjoyed.I've read that Delta is now bringing back hot meals on their first class flights.  Let's hope they bring back some of the first class service too."
Date of travel: March 2022,10,The worst airline website,"I try to use my Delta mileage, after enter all the information and payment and click the Complete; then nothing happening.I thought the transaction didn't go through, I try again, nothing happen, the screen just hanging. I check my credit card right away, there were multiple same transactions from Delta .Then I tried buy with cash, after entered all the information, click complete , then nothing happen, hanging, hanging, hanging.This is the worst airline website; Delta is such huge airline , unfortunately , their website is the worst of worst that I ever experienced."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Don't ask to speak to a human,"The flight/crew etc. decent. Whatever you do DO NOT do anything that will require an actual conversation with anyone! If you enjoy long, one sided conversations' with an AI customer assistant by all means cancel your flight and try to book another flight. You will spend hours (and destroy a manicure) typing messages back and forth and back and forth ad nauseum. Then is you are lucky a newly discovered human being will appear at some point to type more questions and answers. Are any of the humans able to speak? have a voice? just wondering.  Also-this must be a class based service only because look at all of the 'class of service' choices : ,Basic Economy, Economy, Premium Economy, Business and First Class: isn't eveyone on the same damn plane? How can there be 3 levels of Economy? is the Basic Economy in the toilet and you have to give up your seat each time someone needs to use the loo?"
Date of travel: March 2022,40,"ATL - PVD, The Final Leg","We ran into no issues during the final leg of our trip. Just like before, the plane was clean and in great condition, there was a great selection of TV shows, movies, music and games on the aircraft and the crew was helpful.We did have one issue where the flight attendants mentioned that you could pay for additional snacks and drinks using Apple Pay. When my mother-in-law went to pay for a drink and some wine with her Apple Pay, the flight attendant mentioned that she didn't know how to use that feature. It seems that if Delta is going to advertise Apple Pay (or other contactless payment systems), their staff should be well versed in how to use it.Overall, we were impressed with our Delta experience as a whole and will probably use them again when we fly to LA."
Date of travel: March 2022,40,"LAX - ATL, A Continuation of Great Service","On the way back from LA, we experienced the same great service as we did on the way there. Delta did a great job of boarding everyone, keeping the line moving and providing great comfort during the flight.The flight attendant in my area of the plane noticed that I was a little tight in my seat (middle seat, towards the back), so he moved me up to a window seat that had a bit extra legroom, this was greatly appreciated on my end!Overall, I was very impressed with Delta!"
Date of travel: March 2022,40,"ATL - LAX, Impressed with Delta","The second leg of our trip on Delta went just as smoothly as the first! We made it to the gate just as it was boarding, was able to find overhead storage with no issue and had all of the amenities as the first leg of the flight.On this leg however, I was not in an Exit Row and the legroom was tight. I am 6'2"" and found it to be a bit uncomfortable in the middle seat. I was glad that there was USB and AC power at my seat as well.The flight crew was very friendly and did a great job in handing out drinks and snacks. The lavatory was very clean and the plane seemed to be in great condition!"
Date of travel: March 2022,40,First time Flying Delta,"First time flying Delta, and I have to admit, I was very impressed. Boarding was easy and quick, the plane was nice and clean and there was a great selection of TV, movies, music and games in the seat back screen. There was also a USB port at each screen and outlets between each seat in front of you. I was in an Exit Row, so I had plenty of legroom, being 6'2"" tall.Our bags arrived at our final destination with no issues at all. We look forward to flying Delta in the future!"
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Outrageous customer service,"DL flight 1800 3/8/22 Over the years, our family has spent a fortune as loyal Delta customers. Tonight I was utterly devastated with the most horrible customer treatment ever. My wife is disabled and unable to walk for more than a few steps with help, and a came. Delta provided outstanding assistance in Jamaica, getting her on the plane and seated. We paid extra to accommodate her in the Comfort section of the aircraft, first on, first off etc. It is what we usually experience.When we arrived at the gate tonight, no wheel chair assistance was provided at the gate. My wife was told to sit and wait until all the passengers deplaned and then they would see if they could find her a wheel chair. She was told by the first class cabin gentleman flight attendant sit there or just walk up the jet way. I spoke with an extremely insensitive person who appeared to be in charge of the replacing process and he stood at the entrance of the jet way. He told me that they have no staff to help disabled customers. He started that anyone with disabilites just had to wait as the don't want to bring wheelchais down to meet the customers as it may hinder replacing. WHAT!!! I couldn't believe what I was hearing from this totally insensitive human being. He should be fired!!!After waiting until everyone got of the aircraft still no assistance. Just a whole lot of ridiculous rubbish from that gate agent.1, Hanicapped people have to go last. 2. We have no staff to Here help with wheelchair needy customers. 3. He started that a 95 year old person fell on the jetway recently due to busy conditions so we don't want to bring wheelchairs until all other customers have made an exit.We were not the only handicapped persons on that flight  that we're treated in this manner.Eventually I left my wife by the plane and went up the getaway in search of a wheelchair. I found one and returned to my wife. I wheeled her myself all the way through passport controll, baggage and customs as well as struggling with four bags all the way out to curbside to our transportation home.Delta YOU dropped the ball big time tonight. I'm so disappointed in the way your people treated us, and discriminated against customers with disabilaties. I'm just so disappointed, I can't believe the outrageous treatment.I hope that when you read these comments you address the short comings sooner than later. If you care to take the time to follow up feel free to call me at 7702315710"
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Customer Service,"Delta changes your flight then you can't talk or chat with them They are the WORST airline in the USAJust talk to me, don't disconnect me"
Date of travel: February 2022,10,DO NOT FLY WITH DELTA IF YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR BAG,"On February 27, 2022, I traveled to Wilmington, North Carolina for a work trip with one checked luggage and two carry ons. I had a layover as I was traveling from PHL to ATL and then to ILM. I didn't know what I was in for! I arrived to Wilmington, North Carolina with only 2 out of 3 bags. When I was at the departure gate in PHL, the flight attendant informed me that my carry on luggage was not going to fit in the overhead bin and they were going to check it in as a courtesy. There was a family of three or four in front of me and they assumed I was with them and handed me over four different bag tags with her name ""Carissa Fleming"" meanwhile my name is Alejandrie Oviedo. I didn't realize this until i arrived in ILM and realized my bag was missing. I am confused as to why my name and my final destination was not verified to ensure this was being handled properly. As soon as I noticed, I filed a claim the same day and was informed that I would get my bag by 11PM. Bing that I had four baggage tags they were unsure which one was mine and so they just filed the claim under the first bag tagThe following day comes and I have yet to receive my bag so I contact baggage claim where they inform me that it was delivered to Nassau Bahamas baggage claim one and the next flight arriving to ILM will be for the following day. The following day came and still no bag so I went to the airport where they were unable to help me even after speaking to a supervisor. I spoke to about four people in baggage claim over the phone who reassured me that Bahamas have my bag and they will be sending it, but I still have not received it. I literally contacted delta daily and went to the airport daily in efforts to get my bag and I still have not received my bag. I have spoken to so many delta reps who have not been reassuring and this is my first time flying with Delta. I googled Delta to learn more about your baggage policies only to find out that you guys are ranked top 5 to lose people's luggages so of course I became more worried. I spoke to someone on 3/7/21 and this was the first time I was informed to file a loss bag claim when I should have been notified about this days ago. I am confused as to how it went from, ""I have your bag it's in the Bahamas, to we are going to deliver it tomorrow, to I spoke to a nice lady who said she was going to walk it over to customs to send to ILM, to we don't have your bag"" Delta is employing people who are stealing peoples luggages and this is insane. If you guys are known to lose luggages more diligent protective measures need to be put in place to ensure that people do not lose personal belongings. It is so unfair that this has caused my trip to be an inconvenience, no one in Delta cares and no one is on the same page, I am not receiving any updates or helpful information about my bag. I asked for the corporate office number and they were unable to provide me with that. I have things in my carry on luggage that money cannot buy, I have things that I have had for years that hold value to me, I have my home keys and my car keys which is going to make it harder for me when I return home. It is sad that because you guys are so used to losing people's bag that you don't care enough to take more steps to find lost luggages. You guys made a huge error and have not fixed it and so because of this experience I will not feel comfortable flying with you guys again. I am super sad, frustrated, annoyed, and I want to make sure no one else has to go through this. This is not how a business should be operating it is super illegal that you have people in Delta stealing luggages. I am unable to refuse that you guys made a huge error like this and in the process lost my bag. I JUST WANT MY BAG! YOU GUYS NEED TO DO BETTER"
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Delta does not stay true to what it says,Very disappointed with Delta. I had to cancel my flight due to a tragic situation. I contacted Delta who told me that they would cancel the reservation and I would be given Ecredit. When I checked my email I noticed the reservation had been canceled and I was NOT credited for $ 922 even though I was told (I saved the chat with the agent) that I would be credited for the entire flight $ 1391.54.I cannot comprehend how a company as massive as Delta would lie to its customers.Very very very disappointing.
Date of travel: March 2022,40,Good flight from Atlanta to West Palm Beach,"Not Delta's fault but my own but I won't be flying basic economy again.  Normally I don't fly basic economy but because of such a short flight I did it this time.  ""mistake""Sat in the back of the bus and took awhile to get off the plane.  The flight was on time and even landed a little early.  Love Delta and use them a lot.  Friendly cabin staff.  Having to get on the plane at the end of the boarding due to being main 2 was not fun but not a big deal.  I had room for my carry on bag.  Boxed in by dozens of Spring Breakers...."
Date of travel: March 2022,50,Great flight from Augusta Georgia to Atlanta,First time flying out of Augusta Georgia airport in years and was surprised at how small it still is.  No reason to get to the airport more than one hour ahead of time.  Friendly folks there.  The flight with Delta to Atlanta was on time and arrived early.  Friendly crew and no issues.  Small plane but still had room for my carry on bag.
Date of travel: March 2022,50,Great flight from Palm Beach to Atlanta,Had a great flight from West Palm Beach to Atlanta.  Got to the airport early and with TSA precheck got to the gate quickly.  The plane started boarding earlier then expected and took off on time.  Got to Atlanta early.  Rarely fly economy but with the short one hour and 30 minute flight I could not bring myself to pay more.  Flight crew were very nice and except for having to wear the stupid masks it was a good trip.
Date of travel: March 2022,10,DELTA SUCKS!!!,"So I'm traveling from Denver to Tallahassee tonight for work in Neurosurgery to be there for a surgical case at 700am tomorrow.  My flight into ATL was delayed an hour from Denver and I arrived 15 minutes before departure time of my connection into TLH. There were several of us on the plane trying to make that connection. I asked the gate agent as we deplaned to call our gate and let them know we were coming, which he did. We made it to the gate 5 minutes before the scheduled departure time, and they'd already closed the door, even tho we could have easily boarded the plane with time to spare and there were LOTS of seats available on the flight.  So, I'm left having to rent a car at midnight to make the 5 hour drive to Tallahassee.  A true example of careless, thoughtless, short-sighted business practices by Delta.  #deltasucks"
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Delay after delay! They don't care!,"At least three or more delays from horrible Delta trying to get home! No reason, just more delays! Have flown 50 years and this is the worst experience ever!Hollow, meaningless responses in texts and emails. As long as they have your money, they do not care about your time! I will fly any other airline from now on!"
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Delta cut my daughters visit with grandma tofrom 5 to 2 days!,"They sold her seat and told her she had to come home 3 days early. Then they had the nerve to charge her $100 for an oversized bag for her 2 day visit. (4 flights getting to and from) This airline is worse than the low budget cheap carriers. Fly frontier at least getting ripped off will be cheaper. Greedy, rude, short-sighted. I've called numerous times. Was on hold for over an hour and a half one day. The worst!!! Horrible management and zero ethics or decency."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Really Poor customer service,I've always flown delta and usually they have been good at responding when things go wrong.I had a terrible experience this year where I was stranded for 4 days in phoenix with my family. Each day they cancelled our rebooked flights.I missed a week of work and my kids missed school and I had to pay for an extra 4 nights of hotel accommodations and taxis.I complained to Delta and they offered me $50 worth of skymiles. The delay cost me over $2000 dollars.Since then i've called customer service but they won't answer the phone or respond to subsequent tickets.Best to fly with Alaska.
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Dont fly Delta,delta airlines left a group of us stranded in Chile. Our flight was delayed 45 minutes. So by the time we made it to chile from atlanta we were to late for our connection flight. Delta let us set in the airport for two days before were able to fly back to seattle wa. They would not work with us at all about getting our last flight to argentina. They expected us to set and wait tell 10pm the next day to maybe be able to fly on a plane that was fully booked. when we asked anout just letting us set in first class since they had empty seats they expected us to pay for them. Not maybe we messed up and just let people sit were we have empty seats. No we got attitude when we asked and were told we didnt pay for firat class.  I will talk terrible the rest of my life about delta
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Delta Disrespects Passengers,"Beware Delta arbitrarily charging your seat assignment without warning from an aisle up front to a middle way back even if you are a Gold traveling with a Diamond. Oh, and dare complain about it and the gate agent thugs get loud and become smug and dismissive (because they are all powerful). Fortunately, even out of Atlanta I am beginning to find alternative airlines. Advice - if you can’t travel another airline, carefully monitor your seat assignment because these gate agents couldn’t care less about you and will do as they wish (but if you notice you can at least cause a stink and see if they will choose to offend another passenger instead). Disgusting service lately."
Date of travel: March 2022,10,bad experience on Delta,"They downgraded my flight like nothing happened, you can read this message between me and delta. That’s terrible."
Date of travel: February 2022,50,Attentive service and excellent food on Delta One,"All of our flights were on time.  The price we paid for Delta One was similar to what we would pay with another airline once you add baggage and seat selection costs.  We had an excellent Steward named Frank on our flight to LA.  He checked on us often.   He made sure we well watered and fed.   The flight home was a red-eye so the flight attendants let us sleep.  The food was good especially on the LA to Boston flight.   I usually don’t have much of an appetite when I fly but I ate the entire meal.  The salad had a variety of vegetables in it which tasted like they came from the Farmers Market.  Fennel was the side for my meal, which I love.  The chocolate mint cake was delicious.   The airports were extremely busy, so having lounge access was a plus."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Delta/Air France connection nightmare,"There was only a 55 minutes connection between   Delta 82  and  Air  France   AF 962   I  asked about the  55 minutes and was told that was sufficient  time for the  connection. My wife and  I attempted to get to  the AF 962 connection as quickly  as  possible. When we got  there the Air France plane was still there. We watched another family get on and the plane took off.   I  was  told  Air France  planes closes its  door 15 minutes before  take off.  Additionally we could  not  go from the  Delta  terminal to the Air  France terminal without going through security  at the General De Gaulle  airport.   This  took time. No one informed  us of this. We were rerouted to Amsterdam and finally a flight by KLM to Israel .  We were in the Amsterdam  airport for about  7 hours.  We arrived  in Israel 3am  in the  morning,   We lost 12 hours in travel time.  We  missed the first day of our  tour."
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Zero customer service skills and unjust,I called to cancel half my flight which was round trip. I repeatedly told them I wanted only the going (one way) part of my trip canceled. Never once did I tell them to cancel my whole trip. Later we get disconnected and and 2-3 hours later after class I noticed my entire trip was canceled. Those basters realized it would be better to cancel my spring break flight and resell it for 600$.when I called to ask why they canceled my whole trip they said they are sorry but can only offer me to rebook the same flight for 3 x the price I paid.Delta crossed me and that company can go to hell.I’m no longer using my delta sky miles gold card! ….stay away these people got arrogant af … even though they made the mistake
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Bait and Switch,"PAID ADDITIONAL FEE FOR COMFORT CLASS.  DELTA DECIDED TO MOVE OUR SEATS TO ECONOMY AND COMFORT CLASS IS ONLY FOR MONEY PAYING PASSENGERS.  NOT FOR PASSENGERS THAT PURCHASED SEATS WITH DELTA SKYMILE POINTS.I'm writing this email to inform you that I am extremely disappointed for my upcoming trip for the following confirmation #'s - G8VELD, G8YYNZ & G765E8.  We are travelling as 3 adults, 2 children and an 8-month older toddler.Our return flight home from CUN to JFK was originally scheduled at 4:28pm departure.  When booking our trip, we paid additional fees to upgrade our seats to Delta Comfort Class - Seats 11 A, B, C, D & F.  Unfortunately, the flight was cancelled so Delta changed our reservations to the 3:05pm flight, which is fine.  Upon the scheduling change we were place in Comfort class, and we were provided seats 11 D, E, F &   13 D & C.  Earlier this week we were notified that Delta decided to take REMOVE us from the 3:05pm flight and reassign conf. # G8VELD and G765E8 to a connecting flight from Cancun to Minnesota to JFK (2 ADULTS).  Then the remaining passengers on conf. # G8YYNZ (1 ADULT, 2 KIDS and a TODDLER) from Cancun to Atlanta to JFK.When calling Delta support, we were told the original 3:05 PM flight was NOT CANCELLED but we were REMOVED off the flight because the comfort class seats were only for money paying passengers and NOT AVAILABLE FOR PASSENGERS THAT purchased with Delta Sky Miles.  We were able to get back onto the 3:05pm flight but were assigned seats 33 A, B, C, D and E.  This is not what I call good customer service and I’m beyond frustrated and disappointed.This is the dumbest policy I have ever heard of and will probably never fly Delta ever again.  I will share this experience with everyone I know.Thanks for ruining a trip we’ve been looking forward to since March 2020 (originally planned but cancelled due to COVID.  PLEASE LET ME KNOW WHEN I WILL RECEIVE A CREDIT/REFUND FOR THE ADDITIONAL FEE’S WE PAID TO UPGRADE OUR SEATS."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,No help for wheelchair,Delta you suck! Do not offer wheel chair service when there is nobody there to offer a 82 year old woman who does not speak English help. Thank God I was able to travel with her and I had to push her wheel chair with our luggage from the international terminal to customs and its a long walk. Shame on you Delta
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Overall a poor experience,"For starters. On our first flight. The attendant, named Clifton, decided he was gonna continuously bump me as he walked by. I was trying to not get bumped, and he was still doing it. Mind you, I’m not overweight or overly large by any means. He seemed rude and offered zero apology even though I was clearly attempting to stay out of the aisle. After that, my bag was left in New York, it took delta 18 hours to get it back to me. In those 18 hours no one bothered to reach out. I had to call and was given a tracking number. The flying part wasn’t bad, so obviously the captains get two thumbs up. Service crew and other aspects were a crapshoot. Feels like no one cared.  First time flying delta and to reconcile our problems, we were offered gift cards or flight vouchers. Won’t be rendering service from them again anytime soon."
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Literally thieves,"We purchased a flight in 2020 at around $700/800 and because of COVID it was cancelled. They refused to give our money back even though we really needed it during the pandemic and instead they want  us to purchase new tickets... which all cost a minimum of 1300 now. How is that fair? I cannot afford that, I have to pay almost twice as much now. This should be illegal. I am never flying with them again, what a bunch of thieves. I was warned not to chose delta and I should have listened, I hope you learn from my mistake."
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Delta is Awful,"I flew my daughter to visit her grandmother for the first time in 4 years and Delta decided to cut her trip short from 5 days to 2 days with only 24 hours notice. Since the flight she was originally booked on was sold out. I suspect the sold her seat to someone else for mor money. If you don't care about your plans being changed for your business or pleasure and have zero value for your time, then Delta is fine. They actually had the nerve to charge her an additional $100 for baggage check on her return flight of her 2 DSY ViSIT that was supposed to be 6!! I will NEVER use this carrier again"
Date of travel: February 2022,10,From Puerto Rico to JFK they brought *all* baggage to the International Terminal,"We arrived in JFK on Feb 19 2022 with DL1853 and hat to wait almost 2 hours for our baggage until midnight. No representative was around after 11pm. They brought all (!!) checked baggage to the international terminal and then bring it back to the domestic terminal by hand (!!) with one (!) cart. Sorry, but that is awkward. We might expect this from one of the cheaper airlines, but not from Delta.Our kids were so tiered that they slept on the floor"
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Worst experience ever,They are very unresponsive. Need to wait 1 hour to chat over the phone. Worst customer service Ive ever experienced. Not going to use Delta any more
Date of travel: March 2022,10,Very disappointed in Delta,"Absolutely ridiculous that you can not upgrade me to sit next to my husband as much as I fly.Both seats were open and available when I upgraded my husband's seat, Then for whatever excuse you want to give, I was unable to upgrade and sit beside him. I fly Alot for work. My company American Humane flies all of us on a daily basis. I have been very loyal to Delta in my travels. I have not complained about the 4 hour delays and flight cancelations of late, and I feel Delta does not seem to care about loyalty. So disappointing.This is the only time my husband has flown with me and ive been shown nothing but disrespect this entire trip."
Date of travel: February 2022,30,Disrespectful Stewards,"Before Covid 19, we had traveled with Delta airlines to many places, China, Europe and several time to New York and we were happy because the trips were smooth and the pilot will explain every time the reason for delay if any.  We received quite few e-mails that the plane is very clean.  The first time I went to rest room there was no soap. So I washed my hands with water and came to my seat cleaning my hands with wet Ones that I always carry in my handbag.  The second time I went to restroom there was no toilet paper.  So I decided to use the restroom at the front of the plane .  As soon as I put my feet at the front cabin this angry and rude hostess attacked me.  She said you must go to restroom at the back of the plane.  I told her there is no toilet paper there. She said you should ask for it.  I said who should I have asked.  Then she said” don’t do this again”.  I haven’t heard this since kindergarten. Not during my elementary, high school, college and professional work environment.  By this review I am asking that the Delta CEO to come to my humble home to see what “clean” looks like."
Date of travel: February 2022,50,Coming to Europe!,"The service and comfort were excellent! It was a bumpy ride due to a weather system, but the flight crew did everything possible to ensure comfort while on board. I think Delta is the BEST USA airline to travel and would recommend flying them to Europe or domestically."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,canceled,been on hold for 7 weeks and 32 days waiting on a refund that my fglight was canceled at 3 in the morning for a 7 o clock flight to this very minute i am still hereing the jazz music this is company is great and i would definetrly not reccomend it due to thjem owing me 800 dollars and wasting my time nobody wants e credits we want our money
Date of travel: February 2022,50,Great service,Very happy with service and friendly staff. We had 3 carseats go missing but they were delivered to our home the very next day. Excellent customer service. They have people that really want to help you.
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Delta Flight Attendants are Racists !!,"Flight attendants are racists !!  If you black or other minority in the U.S., Delta flight attendant will ignore you while serving other customers !!  They are also rude and very assuming.  Fly some other airline."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Absolutely horrible.,Delta changed our flight the night before. Then separated our seats after I already paid for specific seats. Then told me there’s nothing they can do about it. On our return trip our seats were separated again! Every flight is overbooked and they’re “looking for a few people to take a later flight“ Currently waiting on a “part for a plane” on the delayed return trip. I would rather board a spirit airline than book another flight with delta.
Date of travel: February 2022,50,Love me Delta ! If you want comfort you want Delta,Excellent leg room . Very clean . Amazing experience especially when traveling with children ( one being special needs ) . Courtesy staff and flight crew . Excellent selections in entertainment. Can not go wrong.
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Do not use this airline if you need assistance!!!,"My mother needed a wheel chair and notified delta when booking. Delta at booking  said to arrive 4 hours early, but when we got there delta kiosk did not open until 3 hours before flight and she had to stand with he walker while waiting. .  Communication between delta and their agents is terrible. It got worse when she was flying. They said she had to check her walker, but the how would she go to the bathroom on the plane? So dumb! They constantly did not know she néeded a wheel chair at the connecting flight. What are they not aware of how important this is? She almost missed her next flight because it took forever for someone to get a chair. I would highly recommend using a more competent airline. This is completely unacceptable."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Loyal Customer - What Happened,"Attempted to book a companion fair.  Entered all the info, submitted ""purchase"" the ticket.  However, after several minutes, it came back with ""Opps, I'm sorry"" error code.  Attempting to book again, but it said the flight was ""sold out"", although I had previously selected our seats with more than 40 available.  Called Delta customer service, holding for an 1hr 5min wait time.  When that time expired, the system asked if I wanted a call-back in 2hrs 37mins.  What's has happened to Delta!  Seriously."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Poor Service Onboard,"I was on flight 1600 from Jax to ATL.  The flight attendants stop serving passengers  after Row 29. I was patiently waiting for my coffee in the Row 33 but no one was serviced in rows 30, 31, 32, 33, 34. I am unable to comment for the row 35 and beyond.There was no turbulence and it was 40-45 minutes before landing.  I felt this was a poor display of customer service to those not serviced. I am sure I was not the only one who notice this. A courtesy explanation could have been announced.  However, the flight attendants have plenty time to retrieve the trash from those who were served.  Very disappointed!"
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Non existant customer service.,Delta changed a flight time so we need to modify.  They won't allow 2 of the 4 passengers (one disabled) to modify the reservation.  We have to talk to a representative.  The wait time is 5 hours!!!
Date of travel: February 2022,10,refused refund or exchange for family emergency,"three days prior to a trip to visit my brother my wife fell and hurt her shoulder. my wife now requires a surgery to repair her torn rotator cuff. i asked delta if i could simply move the flight dates so i could care for my wife and they said no. I asked if I could cancel, and refund and they said no. i understand that policy is policy but there should be a medical exemption. i won't fly delta again."
Date of travel: February 2022,20,"Switched to Delta, not best choice","We tried Delta after only flying Alaska for years. The first flight was super, it went down  after that and continues to decline. I only fly first class now that we are older and can afford. I stopped flying due to coach being so cramped and I felt trapped.About 10 years ago we started flying again due to our kids being out of college and first class being financially good for us. I was so happy, Alaska's first class was great, we took one trip trying Delta Vacations, as Alaska vacations disappeared. The first class experience was amazing on Delta and we got an American Express Delta card and flew both Alaska and Delta. That first trip on Delta was the only truly first class experience, since then, down hill.  The service is terrible, food is awful, drinks are minimal (very few options, like in the past), the snacks (which I eat too many of because I am hungry due to the food service being what I would call gross food. Then I try to ease my hunger with the empty calorie snacks.  Where did the healthy salads go, the chicken breast?  This last flight the food was so disgusting and you could smell the flight attendants heating their meals, which I thought were ours, they smelled delicious. Our ""meal"" options were truly horrible.Everyone uses the first class bathroom, which the attendants say is the law?  On Alaska they do not have coach using first class restroom. They allow people from coach to stand in the first class area waiting for the restroom, my husband and I feel like we are in a race to use the restroom due to all the people coming to use it continually.I am going to try United, and am going back to Alaska as much as I possibly can (wish they would reinstate Alaska  Vacations.Delta's First Class is not even close to what it used to be, or needs to be. I write reviews to Delta when they send the option after our trips, I do not get any response and wonder why I write them. Also, getting through to someone to help you on the phone is nearly impossible. Yesterday, I had a 3.5 hour wait with no call back option? Not going to do that.Delta, you need to take a hard look at your first class service, it feels like third class service (whatever that is). I do not feel like I am special, we worked hard to fly first class and spent many younger years in coach, if we pay for First Class, we should receive First Class service. And, when you have past service to compare current service to, it feels like you are being taken. Lower the cost, or get rid of the name First Class, call it bigger seat class, early boarding class etc."
Date of travel: July 2021,40,Very nice premium economy,Very nice premium economy product even in the middle of Covid times. Got a good meal in premium economy; better than some other US airlines first class short haul flights. Also nice service from the flight attendants.
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Dealing with either messaging or contacting a rep is a nightmare.,"Traveled to Orlando on 2-19. Was supposed to leave from cwa to msp, but the first flight was delayed by weather. Took all night and seven different reps to finally get the okay to just drive to msp for my flight to mco. Now it's 2-25, I'm supposed to leave tomorrow at 0547, and after a messaging exchange with their reps assuring me that they've removed the cwa leg of the return trip so I can get my bags at msp (where my car is due to the initial delay), I no longer seem to have a ticket out of mco. Now I have to wait 58 minutes to message or 1 hour and 11 minutes to speak with someone. I'm about to be homeless in FL because of their incompetence and I will never give these bozos my business again. I understand many people fly Delta with no issues. Just pray you never have an issue come up that you need their help with."
Date of travel: November 2021,50,Good customer service for repair of damaged stroller!!,"My newborn daughter and I flew in November 2021. It was an emotional trip and not an easy one to take but the Delta flight attendants made it so nice. On our return trip, the stroller that we gate checked was damaged. I contacted Delta and they worked with me to get the matter resolved and they reimbursed me. They have a process that they need to follow but I had a death in the family and was unable to comply. Rather than excluding me from reimbursement because I couldn’t comply, they worked with me. Delta is a huge corporation and I am one in a million customers but they treated me like I was their only one. I recommend going with Delta!"
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Feel like a hostage,"Living in Minneapolis I feel like a hostage to Delta when I travel. Last episode convinced me that just about any airline we can find will be preferable to flying with them again, no matter the inconvenience. When our flight was cancelled Christmas Eve we got an email that they had taken it upon themselves to reschedule us the next day, which was unacceptable. We found a flight on Sun Country instead. Now Delta won’t refund the price of our ticket. We have been battling with them for 2 months now and they just don’t give a damn. Terrible ‘customer service ‘. There are many other things I hate about them, but this is the top of my list."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Won’t fly delta again,"Flight delayed 24 hours on the way out. While trying to get my second flight switched (I had a 20 min layover) the delta messaging system is also terrible. The gentlemen on the messenger accidentally bumped me off my flight entirely when I told him this he just disconnected and lucky I was able to get a seat voucher to even get on the flight. Now on my return trip they have given me a 32 min layover (if everything goes as planned) so hopefully I’m not stuck in Detroit over night as this is the last flight back to Burlington. Other than deltas awful planning and support, the flight crew was great. Overall I will not fly delta again an extra $100 for United is worth the headache."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Delta - Westjet - Not Working,"Booked flight from Tampa, FL to Nanaimo, BC. Spouse refused boarding with Westjet, at the gate as he handed them his boarding pass, with WestJet stating they had no record of spouse being on flight. He had boarding pass! No one helped and he had to stay in Calgary overnight. Called Westjet and was told Delta FAILED to inform the airline Westjet that he was going to fly with them. Unbelievable."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,No customer care,My flight got cancelled and I tried to call care Waiting time was 3:22 minutes. They have SMS support service. I tried it and they change my flying city and after no response from them. I would never use delta in my life.
Date of travel: February 2022,10,The Worth airline in USA,"Worth airlines ever, even worth than Spirit and Frontier airlines and expensive , always delays, always, made us wait woth mask for more than an hour, because  they could not load cargo, in passenger plane they also care cargo and make people wait for their own benefit"
Date of travel: December 2021,40,Delta is improving,"This review is based on a Business Class ticket from JFK to Denver.  When I entered the plane, I was pleasantly surprised to find out that my Business Class seat was the individual kind, where you have your own TV, cabinet to store stuff and the chair reclines to 180 degree. Very comfortable seat with plenty of room. The service was limited however they had a gluten free box of some snacks for me. Entertainment was excellent, lots of movies and shows, I almost was disappointed the flight was on time, I was unable to finish my movie. My one major complain is the bathroom which was not as clean as it should be. Overall everything went smoothly. Flight left on time, arrived on time and the crew was very courteous. I will definitely fly Delta again."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Delta Air Lines first class sucks,Bought our tickets in Dec. 2021  booked my husband and I separately because we both have miles.  Day before we leave and I go to check in.  Delta moves my first class seat to another one and puts my husband in comfort even thought we paid for first class.  After sitting on the phone for 2.5 hrs I am told the flight is booked and there arent any seats.  Oh but be sure to call this number after the flight to complain and maybe get a refund.  What the heck.  Delta are crooks.....
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Rude crew member - overbooked flights,"We are extremely dissatisfied with our latest flight with Delta Airlines. We had traditionally had wonderful experiences with your airline but this flight was an exception to the rule. We departed from Providence, Rhode Island with an expected final destination in Nashville, TN. The issues began when we landed in LaGuardia, NY.When we arrived at LaGuardia we were able to rush off the plane to get to our connecting gate prior to the specified time of departure. We had arrived with 8 minutes to spare. This is where we were greeted with hostility by Delta member at the gate. She had informed us that standby passengers had been given our seats and she was not going to call any crew member to open the jet bridge and let us on. She told us it was “Our fault we did not get there on time”. We were taken back on how rudely we were treated by this Delta crew member. Clearly, weather related issues can cause delayed flights, but this was in no way something we could control. We went to the information desk where another crew member couldn’t even understand why we were refused entry onto the plane.  Delta had then oversold the next 2 flights out of LaGuardia for the day not allowing us an opportunity as standby passengers. This then would only leave us the opportunity to get another flight to Nashville the following day which would have put us into Nashville at after 3pm the next afternoon losing an entire other day and ½ our trip.Because of this. We were forced to rent a car out of LaGuardia and drive 15 hours to Nashville.  After being at TF Green at 3am for a 5:20am flight we would not arrive in Nashville until being up for close to 24 hours and traveling across 7 states."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Delta sucks,"Delta charges extra to enter lounge do not get filled by their offer to buy first class they will not let you in their first class lounge. Seats are terrible, plastic cups on first class! Worst airline!!"
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Do not fly first class on Delta!!!,Don’t ever pay for first class! Delta is the worst airline in the world. No access to first class lounge they ask to pay an extra $500 on top of first class airfare?  Uncomfortable seats and terrible costumer service
Date of travel: February 2022,40,Good domestic airline,I was only frustrated after we missed our connection due to a delay and didn't get put on a flight the same day but they took care of us all the same.
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Horrible airline,"After falling asleep and having my mask fall down around my nose I was belittled by their flight staff. Not one but 3 of them. Once we landed they called a ""red coat "" to come and harrass me some more. They threatened to kick my off of the next flight if I didn't stand there and get lectured in front of the other passengers. I will never fly this airline again they do not value their customers.Pick any other airline. This one is a joke."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Worst booking experience of my life,"I had booked a round trip ticket to Prague in early 2020 that had to be cancelled due to Covid. They gave me a refund in e certificates- approximately $3400.  I am now trying to rebook a ticketto. Prague and I have literally been trying to book a flight for 5 days 7 hours each day. Each time on the app, it will either bomb out after taking my e certificates out of my account or book it without the e certificates. I have a text string 50 feet long with co versations with multiple agents. This is now my 3rd hour on the phone because the flight booked without crediting the certificates. They say since it booked, you cannot add them. I swear they are making it impossible so they don’t have to give the credit. Has anyone else experience this?"
Date of travel: January 2022,50,Delta is a great family,"Sorry it took longer to do this review went in Jan, Direct flights are the way to go if you can. From the people at check in, the gate keepers, to the pilots and flight attendants, the flights to and from Cancun were awesome. I will only fly Delta it is the best. I finally  got my Silver medallion and now will keep on going. Flights were on time and smooth as can be. Thanks for making my friend and I feel like we are family. Went 25th to Feb. 3rd. Can't wait to go again with this great company. Thanks again  Douglas P.  (UT)"
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Service was awful,"Most of them were rude and had to wear this mask the whole flight and was just overall very uncomfortable the whole 3 hour flight, would not rec come down! Next time I’m driving!!!"
Date of travel: February 2022,30,Seating,"I do not mind flying delta. I just hate the fact they always put me in the middle . If my profile says aisle then assign me a aisle sit. Also, I do not enjoy riding the far back of the plane due to not having any room to breathe I prefer the middle of the plane but for some reason they continue to put me all the way in the back."
Date of travel: February 2022,20,Great airline; Terrible customer Service !,"Called customer service at 1-800-221-1212.  and was told it was an 1:54 minute wait.This is common.   I have called other times, and wait times can exceed 3 hours!"
Date of travel: February 2022,40,Great service,"I was amazed how delta airlines  service was on my way back from mexico they were generous on the snacks and drinks, i like it when they give you a salty snack and a sweet snack at the same time however on our way to Mexico they only gave us a tiny kind bar which will break your teeth if you try to bite on it.But over-all delta airlines is my favorite airline so far.Even my parents took it flying from france to Seattle and they were pleased with the service."
Date of travel: February 2022,20,Lost Luggage,Long Flight with 2 stops. (Seattle & Inchon) It was a very stressful trip due to the airlines inability to process the boarding requirements efficiently and flight attendants making it uncomfortable once onboard. I had to show all documents to each agent at every stop -- that was on top of uploading all the same documents to the embassy website before arriving at the airport -- Which caused Delta to remove my luggage from the Seattle leg and not arrive in Thailand for 2 days -- with no compensation.It's not a good time to travel to Thailand unless you really have to.The requirements of the Thai Government are excessive and illogical -- seems like a scam to me. I would choose another destination that wants me to be there...
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Delta changed direct flights to connecting flights,Watch out for this airline. They’ll change your direct flight to a flight with connections that will cost you entire vacation time. Four day weekend to ski now a two day because of them. They aren’t even willing to let you change to other flight out of different airport in order to keep the direct flight. What a shame. I’ll never consider using them again.
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Delta Airlines Customer Service Experience & Wonderful Website,Tried to book my flight on the website and could not get the website to check me out for 3 tickets it kept freeze and requested I pick my seats but all I wanted to do was purchase the tickets. While I am trying to do this I call customer service and the representative basically talks to me like I am stupid telling me you canIck your seat later. I get that all I want to do is check out. He tells me sorry you have waited to longer and the seats sold out the price went up you might want to try another flight and hangs up. Now I do not get the seats I wanted because your computer system got hung up and I get a rude useless customer service representative. I plan to cancel my Delta credit card and fly another airlines that appreciates and works with there customers.
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Property damage,My laptop was in my checked luggage. TSA searched it and when they repacked the bag they put the laptop on top unprotected. Delta said laptops weren't something they could compensate. They told me to file a claim with my homeowners insurance and said the actions of TSA weren't their problem. That's rich coming from a multi-billion dollar company.
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Worst customer service rudest flight attendants,This is by far the worst experience with delta. The flight attendant Myra K. and Claire were the rudest people I’ve ever encountered. I was in premium and my husband was in delta comfort. When we boarded I asked my husband to sit next to me since I have anxiety with take off. the plane was half empty and  I never had any issue before with other airlines . Claire approached us almost scolding at my husband for not being in his seat and snatched the headphone away. It wasn’t about the seat being premium since the amenities were subpar to begin with. It was entirely for him to calm me during the takeoff. I’m not upset because of him going back to the seat but they were horrific and rude about it.  She and Myra were absolutely hostile towards me in a condescending tone.  They do not belong  in the hospitality industry. As we were about to land my husband moved up so that he could retrieve the luggage from the overhead bin but then Myra stormed over and said he could not sit there. I asked for her name and she raised her voice saying that she did nothing wrong. I’m absolutely traumatized by her rudeness. As I was getting off the plane she told me to wait for a customer service person to speak to me. After a 10 hour flight the last thing I want is to wait even longer at the airport. She then responded with ‘whatever’.  I’m horrified with her unprofessional behavior and I broke down crying.  I feel absolutely being discriminated against since I’m a minority. I’d never fly with delta again if that’s the representation of their service. I do not recommend flying with delta. The bathroom was disgustingly dirty as well. Considering they are the most expensive flight going to Europe there’s no value in it at all.  They sure know how to ruin a customer’s flight.
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Ok for once,"For the first time, in a long time, flying on Delta was not the authoritative dictatorship that we have all come to experience for most the past 2 years. I fly a lot. Delta stewardess generally act like very rude dictators. Yelling and pointing and demanding, ""Put that mask up right now!"" ""Get that mask over your nose now!"" ""You aren't taking a drink of your water now are you?"" ""Put your mask back on!!"" and it goes on and on. They are generally constantly looking around to see anyone slip their mask down to take a drink or a bite of food, and immediately, they started walking quickly down the aisle, toward the culprit to lecture him/her or to even yell at that person in front of everyone!! I do not know who died and made these stewardess's queen of the airways, but evidently someone did. But, two days ago, on a return flight on Delta, was the first time since this dumb pandemic, that the stewardess's did not do this. I did not hear any of them doing their usual yelling at passengers, or see them sashaying down the aisle quickly, to sternly warn a passenger. It was nice for a change. These airlines need to realize that we are all paying customers, who pay their salaries, and we are all human beings and that they are not the lords of rudeness. I have already decided not to fly Delta again, from too many past dictatorship experiences. Generally, No one on the plane who works there acts like they are even happy that you are their. Most of them act like it is such a bother to them that any one is aboard their plane.  The rudeness and yelling is quite unbearable and the throwing of luggage, when the loading workers load their planes, is ridiculous. I have had every piece of luggage I purchased, destroyed on the very first time used, by their cargo loaders. So, if you must fly Delta, at least there is a possibility that now, you might get a flight with less tyranny and lording over passengers by the rude as hell stewardess's. But don't count on it or on having your luggage come out unscathed."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,The most noisy and stinky airlines ever.,The plane itself it the oldest and noise. The noise will make you sick and also it stinks. Delta is the worst of all in flight safety at all.
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Worst First Class Experience Ever,"I have traveled on just about every US domestic airline, and this was the worst First Class experience ever.Every other airline usually has a bulkhead between First Class and Premium Economy seats, but not Delta.  There were 3 rows of premium economy seats directly behind the 5 rows of First Class seats.  So why am I paying extra to be in the same smaller cabin with those who paid much less?  In addition, those 3 extra rows of economy seats, very narrow amd close together, made the front cabin feel very congested.As for extra First Class amenities .... there were none.  The service received was no better than economy flights I had previously taken.  My child asked for apple juice, and they told us all they had was cranberry juice.  As for sodas, the choices were Coke, Diet Coke and Ginger Ale.  And on a 3+ hour flight, they never once asked if we wanted drink refills.As for food, when our drinks were served, we got no snack.  Other airlines usually give you some trail mix or biscotti.  About an hour into the flight, they started food service, which consisted of a prepackaged box with a small sandwich, potato chips and a cookie.  We have had better food boxes in other airlines' economy classes than Delta's First Class offering on this trip.As for the First Class seats, they felt minimally padded and weren't very comfortable.  And they also didn't recline very far.This was my first experience with Delta First Class, and it will definitely be my last."
Date of travel: February 2022,30,Safety is a five - 1st class meal is third class.,"When take offs equal landings I consider a flight very successful.  However, first class service and food has been lacking of late.  Service has been just okay.  Food has been terrible.  We have made eight  flights in the last three months."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Hell no,Never again.. I would rather walk then use this Airline!!! Straight 💩!! Make a list of how bad your service is....
Date of travel: February 2022,50,Family emergency,We had a family emergency and had to book a last minute flight. Delta found us a flight and was very caring and understanding. I am a skymiles member and won’t ever change. Thank you Delta.
Date of travel: January 2022,50,Quick and easy,"The plane was clean, flight crew was friendly and attentive.  Each seat had a tv screen, which they offered FREE head phones to everyone on board.  They also offered complimentary beverages and snacks.  Easy to book and happy to say it was an uneventful flight. All passengers wore masks as asked.  Luggage was quickly unloaded and available for pick up at the baggage claim area."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Horrible,"The service was absolutely unacceptable. We booked a flight from Newark to Reno. We knew there would be a layover when we booked the tickets. However, our flight was changed multiple times and we ended up having TWO layovers. When we finally reached Reno, we were oh so pleasantly surprised to find that one of our bags had been lost. We were going on a snowboarding trip and obviously needed certain equipment. It just so happened that the bag that this idiotic airline lost was the ones with our snowboard boots in it. We were told that the bag would be there by that morning but of course the day came and went and no bag was delivered to the house we were staying at. When we tried to call, we were informed that the estimated hold time for the call was 1 hour and 36 minutes. This airline could only have given worse service if they had lost all of our bags. 0/5 stars do not recommend"
Date of travel: February 2022,10,You guys suck!,"Oh Delta, you need to do better. You guys have nicely messed up my mothers scooter. Way to go! 🤬😢🥴"
Date of travel: June 2021,20,Delta is going downhill,"This was the second time that Delta messed up my flight (and it has happened again after that). I was flying with two teenaged girls. We had splurged on first class. I didn't get any notice that there was a change in flight. When I looked about 10 hours before our flight was going to take off to make sure it was still on time, all of a sudden, it says there's a change and we're going to miss our connecting flight. I wasn't worried because our connecting flight was leaving from the same gate we landed at, so I figured we must just be getting off the plane for them to clean it and then we'd get right back on. No biggie. Sat on hold for 4.5+ hours and started a chat that someone finally replied to when we were already on the ground. When I got up in the morning, everything was the same, but by the time we got to the airport someone had changed our flight without even speaking to me or sending an email. It made us lose our first class seats and we arrived a couple hours later than we were supposed to. Then I had to call a few days after we got back to get my first class fare refunded because they didn't do it automatically, like they said they will. I have had similar scenarios every time I have tried to fly with Delta in the past two years. I used to love Delta. Now I try to avoid them."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Horrible airlines,"Very disappointed , My flight got delayed so I missed my next flight, they offered me to ho to another city (6 hours drive) the next day or to wait 2 days to go to Algiers And when I try to talk to them about it they told me is not their problem and I should talk to the travel agency"
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Total disaster,"Booked a first class ticket using miles a few days ago at a ridiculously inflated price.Did this so I could cancel without a penalty. Trip was in six weeks, I felt the schedule was likely firm that close to departure.  Departure time was late afternoon.  Three days later I was notified of a “schedule change” and that my 5:30 pm departure had been changed to 8:00 am!  The only real change was a downsizing of the aircraft on one leg, with no first class section.I called the SkyMiles member number - a 1 hr 40 min wait.  Tried again the next morning - 2 hr 20 min wait.  I could not effect the change on the website, as I wanted to keep first class on one leg, and the website showed no first class option at all.I then proceeded to spend the next THREE HOURS fussing with their messaging system, which Delta feels is better than talking to the customer.  It only takes about three to five times as much time to get anything done.  The final insult?  After paying for first class seats, and being downgraded on one leg, I had to spend additional miles in order to get two seats together! Really, Delta???They used to be the epitome of customer service in the ‘80’s and ‘90’s - my how the mighty have fallen.  If I ever again think of utilizing Delta, I hope someone urges me to get professional help.If they are this impaired on the ground, are they truly competent to fly planes? I will review again after my trip.  I hold little hope of a satisfactory experience."
Date of travel: January 2022,20,Poor Recent Policy Changes eff. 1/22,"Recent changes has made this airline very unfriendly.  If you buy a basic economy, the lowest fare, you have to pay a penalty of about $90 if you change or cancel the flight.  No exception even if you get Covid.  No mileage added for this kind of ticket.  It's impossible to talk or chat with a live person.   The wait is usually over an hour no matter when you call.  It's no longer my preferred airlines."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,WEBSITE IS GARBAGE,First DELTA locked me out of my account. After several attempts to retrieve password I gave up and decided to use guest mode. Everything was fine until confirmation of payment - and of course it crashed. Im so SICK OF THIS COMPANY AND ITS TRASH WEBSITE. This happens 3/5 times I try to use this damn website.FIX THE SITE YOU TRASHBAGS
Date of travel: January 2022,50,Every flight with Delta is Amazing,"It was wonderful to see the return of in flight food. The first class meal is the perfect lunch, and the snack boxes available in all cabins are remarkable. Fast wifi, friendly flight crew, and almost always landing early."
Date of travel: February 2022,10,Fed up,Had to cancel due to weather and I am not getting refunded!!!  Do not fly with these crooks!!  They said it was their policy!!
Date of travel: February 2022,20,Delayed flight,Why would Delta allow a plane to be boarded knowing that the flight is Delayed? Boarding was delayed and then once on the plane asked to sit in the plane for another hour. Why would we have to sit in the plane uncomfortable listening to kids cry cramped. I could of sat in the airport.  Very disappointed in Delta.
Date of travel: December 2021,50,Nothing but positive things to say,"We flew Delta in the midst of all this craziness last month. The airlines are doing the best they can in dealing with Covid regulations and staff shortages. Our flight was delayed awhile because they were down an attendant, but amazingly, they were able to secure a replacement in time for our flight to take off! Delta made me feel extremely safe and taken care of when I was originally anxious to fly during the Omicron surge. Safety measures are top notch and it is MUCH appreciated."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,lost baggage,"We spent a lot, for poor service and lost luggage. My daughter goes to school in Knoxville and checked into Sarasota airport 2 hrs early so that she would be sure to make her flight. She did, but her luggage did not. They did say it would be there 5 hours later and offered to deliver it to her but they couldn't give her any time frame. She had school materials that she needed the next morning. She asked for a refund for the checked bag and they refused, even though we purchased insurance. They should have refunded the checked bag and the insurance. Terrible policies and very inconvenient."
Date of travel: January 2022,50,Post-Quarantine-in-Mexico Flight,"Expecting that it would take forever to check in because I had just come out of quarantining for 5 days in Mexico after testing positive there, I thought that the certification letter I had received from a resort doctor would take a long time to validate at the check-in counter @ Cancun Airport. It was a breeze. Five minutes after showing my positive test result & my husband's negative test result, plus my medical clearance letter, we were cleared to fly (Note: For now, you are required to check in at the airport the day of the flight, rather than in advance online or through the app, since Delta does not have the technology to scan the medical clearance letter on those platforms.). The flight crew was as comical & yet firm as possible regarding folks wearing their masks while on the plane, snack service was efficient, we were quite comfortable having happily paid extra for Comfort+ seats.& the flight itself was smooth."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Wish I could give a zero.,Had to find out from another airline the flights were canceled. Trip was time sensitive and I could only fly in the next two days. Could not get ahold of Delta for 6hrs. By then I was on flights that cost 4x more. When they called back and heard the complicated situation the phone went silent. Guess they didn't want to deal with it despite polite out of desperation. Or they get reviewed or paid by how many calls they resolve. This one would have ate up some time.I will do my all never to fly with them again.Still after 26hrs of traveling and 4 flights not to my destination and still haven't been able to talk to a Delta representative.
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Missed Flight thanks to Flight Attendant Tardiness,"Simply put. Flight from ATL to DET was delayed 40 minutes due to flight attendant tardiness. I was supposed to have a 50 minute layover. So that translates to 10 minutes to deplan and run across DET to get to my connection. Hurray! I made it to my flight before the boarding time on my ticket only to find out that they close the gate 10 minutes before departure. WTF?! Why would they do that when the boarding time that they noted on my ticket was still moments away? So here I am, sitting here in DET for 8 hours waiting for the next flight. While I’m thankful for another flight, it’s a waste of my time and they only offered a $15 food voucher.. disappointed in Delta."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Never fly Delta,"I am sitting here in my third hour of waiting for bags to take to a hotel after 3 flight cancellations. I was told the bags would be off of the plane, to go to baggage claim.Then told they are already on tomorrow flight, would have to wait 4-5 hours to get bags. We were gracious enough to allow them to tag our bags, which were carry ons due to their overfilling a plane.Very tired, hungry, and treated very rudely."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,All I can say is I’m very disappointed..,"I have so many things to say about delta from the pre check employees ,“helping desk”, flight attendants, pilots all the way down to your sky club…Your pre check employee told me to take off my belt which I hadn’t realized I still had on and then tried to play a game of who could grab it faster and he tried to rip it out of my hands after he handed it to me. You have plane cleaners but yet the plane was filthy from the seats with crumbs in them to the dirty flap on the back of seat where my safety booklet is to the point  if I had to look through it was covered in trash and others food and used masks but we had to wait an extra 35 mins to have your “cleaning crew” on board. Your sky club employee maybe because I’m younger and don’t look like I belong there started to help me and the two other gentlemen walked in and he very rudely cut off my service and started to help them not even saying give me just one second I’ll be right back with you to the point I was embarrassed and just walked out.. canceled my flight home due to high winds but yet winds were only 11 mphs I was flying to Tulsa,Oklahoma  but delta canceled my flight but let Dallas,Oklahoma City,Denver and more flights leave after mine was canceled due to all flights were grounded due to weather. I WILL NEVER USE DELTA AGAIN! Mainly they are rude don’t have answers for you and will find ever excuse to tell you no they can’t do something for you..they have horrible culture and clearly need to take customers service classes…If you don’t wanna work with people and help people don’t get a job where that is your job."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,"Buy a ticket for lost luggage, time and money","Delta lost my luggage and took up hours and hours (days?) of my life trying to sort it out. Any time I needed to contact someone at Delta, I sat on hold or in their chat for 2+ hours.  Different people tell you different things, sending you on a wild goose chase. This airline took my time, money and luggage and left me with only frustration, exasperation and bitterness. 0/10, would not recommend."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Very very bad,"No explanation, no excuses, bad service, they make you feel they don’t care at all about you and you depend on them. No explanation no effort. When people start to complain they start apologising, explaining “we are all on the same side”. No you didn’t sleep I. The floor tonight mr /mrs, not knowing when you could leave the airport."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,DELTA SCREWED US!,Delta SCREWED US out of the cruise we booked 11 MONTHS ago. They waited until 9:00pm to screw us out of our 6:00 am flight.
Date of travel: January 2022,20,Nope,I’ve had to fly a lot over the last 4 years and I’ve had some good and bad experiences from multiple airlines. I’ve always thought of delta as a step above the rest. They usually don’t disappoint. Delta longer stands out. I can’t say it’s only delta but flying these is no longer the convenient and enjoyable way to travel like it used to be. I can’t remember the last time I scheduled a flight and everything went smoothly. I would almost be shocked now if a flight took off and landed on schedule. This has gotten to be ridiculous. Take my advice…find another way to get where you’re going.
Date of travel: January 2022,10,"On Hold three hours, just need an itinerary post flight","I have been trying to obtain an itinerary post travel, I have been on hold for three hours and cannot get a representative in chat either. Absolutely deplorable customer service. I will NEVER use Delta for my personal flights and recommend that travelers I serve avoid them as much as possible. If I could give you zero ""0"" stars I would. this is unprofessional and unacceptable."
Date of travel: October 2021,30,Not the most leg room.,Overall the flight wasn't too bad. The boarding process was painless and the in flight service was good. My main complaint was the seating. They are very narrow and do not have any leg room. I'm just lucky that the flights were fairly short.
Date of travel: January 2022,50,I'm Happy with Delta,"I""ve been happy with Delta.  I see a lot of service issues posted, but scheduling hassles, cancelations, weather, etc. happens with all airlines... especially over the past month when there were a lot of staffing issues as airlines had to deal with those unvaccinated employees who were fired.  All in all, I've been choosing Delta over JetBlue to FLL (and I like JetBlue for their live TV and free internet) because in my particular situation:> Deltq has CLEAR available at their terminal> I receive FREE checked bags (2 for each in my party) > I am given priority seating, Comfort+, as an upgrade> I am offered upgrade to First Class, based availability/priority basis> Access to DL Airport LoungesSo, the perks outweigh the free internet and tv on JB.  On Delta, Live TV is variable and you have to pay for internet.  On todays flight, they had TV, but the screen wasnt great.  Some DL planes have nice, larger TVs... its a crapshoot and that is frustrating.  I did get access thru my phone to the TV, but that's a bit inconvenient... was happy to have it, don't get me wrong.Flight today was on time, so all was well today with DL."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,They stole my refund!,"I came back from Beijing because of the pandemic. I canceled my return ticket to Beijing because I couldn't get back sadly. After contacting them they said they returned my funds to my card... I checked after 1 week nothing after a few weeks I contacted them again and they said yup money is in your account I told them no it's not because I don't have it. They have refused to provide anything showing it was returned. OVER 2 YEARS LATER I am out 2000 dollars in a pandemic! These people are NOT to be trusted. They will steal your money and leave you stranded. This company is clearly willing to lie and steal from you. There is ZERO customer service, ZERO accountability and ZERO chance of you getting any of your money back.Becareful who you fly with cuz once they have your money you won't get it back. Fly with a company that will actually get your hard earned money back. Sincerely, A ripped off customer"
Date of travel: January 2022,10,WORST FLIGHT IVE EVER HAD.,"So I left FLL to go to JFK. The flight left late so I missed my connecting flight from JFK to ROC. I had to wait a extra 7 hours and didn’t make it home by 12:30 am. I was supposed to be home by 5:30 pm. I paid extra to get home earlier so I could make work the next day. I also had to eat lunch and dinner so that was about 200. All they offered me was a 50 dollar vaulter or 50000 miles. I said that’s ridiculous and to keep it my family and I will never fly delta again. Unless you like to get screwed over and not reimbursed for something that’s not you’re fault at all then delta is for you. Only southwest from now on, definitely worth the extra for direct flights."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,No retribution. Nothing but problems with Delta..,"When it comes to booking a flight there is no problem. Delta is more than happy to take your money. Whenever I try to contact them with a huge laundry list of issues costing me over $2000 more after my round trip to get back home. When you call the corporate phone number, the shortest hold time was 3 1/2 hours, after being on hold for about an hour the phone automatically disconnected. I’ve tried calling them multiple times with their automated system hanging up on me. Some of the hold times are five hours or more and still no luck. I posted a complaint on line through Delta’s website, then I receive an email that it could be 30 days until they get back to me. I go through text messaging for over an hour, and they tell me to call the corporate line again, and each time I get disconnected. This is seriously ridiculous."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Worst airline I’ve ever flown for many reasons.,Terrible customer service throughout the whole flight experience. It’s obviously acceptable for them to be rude to customers. Flights changed a few times. Once mid flight. Messing up other parts of our vacation plans. I needed a medically documented accommodation. They couldn’t have cared less. All of our flights were over sold. We had to check our carry ons. They basically said take another flight or book on another airline. It was a horrible experience.  Will never use again and would not ever recommend this airline!!
Date of travel: January 2022,10,22 hour delay,"Worst experience ever. DO NOT FLY DELTA. Seattle to Spokane a flight that is usually about 45 minutes, was delayed 6 hours and eventually canceled leading to a 22 hour flight delay. Due to lack of pilots. Delta did not cover a rental car to drive the 4 hours. No overnight accommodations. NOTHING but a big F U. I was supposed to start a brand new full time job the next date and had to miss work. Not compensated. How is this even a business?"
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Bad employees,"Check-in agent refused to let us onto our flight because we were 59 minutes from departure and not 60 minutes prior to departure for our returned flight.  He was rude, slammed his computer shut in front of us and said you are not getting on and walked away knowing there were no flights the next day.  We had to change our flights, rebook a covid test and change all of our appointments and commitments back in the US.  We took our flight on Friday and 2 people got on the flight 1/2 hour before departure.  How do you make sense of that?  Delta has always been amazing, I use them for most of my travels and I travel a lot!  Too bad a seriously bad employee can ruin it."
Date of travel: January 2022,20,They seriously cannot move any slower,"I'm so frustrated with the constant lack of awareness and consideration Delta has for it's travelers. I travel frequently (minimum 4 flights a month) due to work and up until this point, I've also choose Delta.It seems to me that some serious re-organization needs to happen and policies need to be reviewed.Show up to the gate at boarding time and the plane hasn't even arrived. Sunday evening, I sat (fully boarded) on the plane for a HOUR for a LATE pilot to do a safety check. I consistently miss my connecting flights and it's unacceptable. Delta needs to account for time, make sure they have a plan in place, make sure things are ready to go before boarding ON TIME. Make things make sense, If you can't get things together to ever make a connection then I don't know.. maybe offer a different option. Lord please help Delta, they need it."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,"Jolie From Customer Service Was Rude, Condescending and Unhelpful","After being put on hold for over an hour, I spoke with a customer service representative (Rachel) who was very kind but needed to transfer me to her supervisor (Jolie) to discuss a flight cancellation because my wife tested positive for COVID a few days before our trip. From the beginning of our conversation, the supervisor was condescending, rude and to be honest, disrespectful. Sensing that the conversation was not going to go anywhere, I asked if there was another supervisor that I could talk to and I was hung up on. Needless to say, Delta will not be receiving any of my business going forward."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Worst airline I have flown in 50 years of flying.,"During booking, an offer to upgrade to Comfort Plus was taken. The offer said it was more legroom priority boarding, guaranteed overhead bin space, enhance meal and upgraded snacks during flight. First problem was seats. I book a month ahead and only middle seats available but aisle and window seats were blocked for preferred customers.. Boarding in Atlanta was chaos & disorganized. Comfort class was never called and boarded with main cabin. People from back of plane put their carryons in bins for comfort class as they walked by. I had no space for mine. Food was the same as the rest of economy not anything different. It was  micro portion with 1 cookie for dessert. Salad  was dry with no dressing pack. I mostly fly international monthly before Covid now starting again. Usually fly nonUSA carrier. Fell for Delta’s false advertising on Comfort Plus and booked it. Ii have been flying since 1973 and this was the absolute worst experience from reservation to flight I ever had. I  will never fly Delta again and will stick with foreign carriers as their service is much better. My advise is don’t waste your money on Comfort Plus as only part good was legroom but I am sure seats a&b in main cabin would have been just a good .   Also the flight attendants were shabbily dressed in all sorts of outfits with what seemed no specific uniform - I thought they were passengers!  Delta sorry your service is really bad."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Joke Airline from Hell,"I am baffled by the 4 star average reviews. We are often forced to use Delta because their hub is in Michigan, and they are the only airline on the route we need during certain times of the year. When I can use Allegiant, I do, and making or cancelling a reservations takes like 10 minutes. With Delta, changing a reservation used to be impossible on line, because they didn't offer the option. You used to have to call and wait on line for like seriously 7 or 8 hours. Now you can change online, but it doesn't work often. They changed my flight time so it no longer works, but I have no way to back out of the ticket online, because the system is always down, to know what if any penalty there is, and no way to get anyone on the phone. Seriously, try to call them and sometimes you get a busy signal, sometimes they just say ""we aren't really taking calls right now,"" sometimes they ask for a number to call you back and you carry the phone around for a day but they don't ever call. Or if you are lucky you can hold all day. It's like you are in a developing world country. ARe they still an airline? I get the labor shortage, but this has been going on for a year: can't you fix your stupid website in a year??? I am stuck with all these credits on Delta, but I think I will go mad if I actually try to use them. Even just basic stuff, like you log onto the website to look at ""my trips"" but no, you still have to have your credit card, or reservation number (they sometimes don't email me my tickets, so this is a problem). What is that? No one does that. That's why you log on? The service is fine when you fly but I have seriously probably wasted 20 hours of my life cancelling tickets and trying to use ecredits. I think I might take the greyhound next time."
Date of travel: January 2022,20,"Premium Economy, not really!","A few days before our flight in October 2021, we noticed my husband’s seat had been changed to economy, no longer seating next to each other in premium economy.  We purchased our tickets separately due to savings buying them that way but we were seated together.  Didn’t know I should have called Delta so they could link the seats, my ignorance.  Customer service was able to find us two seats sitting together in the front row of premium economy which my husband insisted we avoided when I first bought them due to no under-seat storage.  CS said they were the only two seats in PE and that the flight was full so it was it that or sit separately.  I have a fear of flying so having him near me settles my fears.  Personally I like the extra leg room but I get his preference as he likes to have easy access to his backpack.  So to me this wasn’t a big deal but then our seats didn’t recline, both of them didn’t.  Then I look around our aisle and see the other seats in the center and other side of the plane are reclining, so our seats are broken which is why I guess our two seats were the last seats.  Then my TV didn’t work either, constantly freezing that I could no longer have it on.  It was really uncomfortable and painful on our backs trying to sleep (got no sleep really) in seats that don’t recline.  We had plans to drive 4+ hours once we landed, so it was a really bad experience on Delta.  No I didn’t tell the flight attendants bc I already knew the flight was full and when I asked for an extra drink, they already snarked at me with a rude response, mind you PE are allowed extras per the ticket class and cost.  First time flying Delta to Portugal where I’ve traveled to PT every summer with my parents in 80/90’s on TWA (miss TWA) or TAP through 2016 and never an experience like this.  Next time, I’ll stick with TAP and pay more knowing I’ll have comfort, worth the price!  Apologies for the long review, been sitting with this complaint for a few months now and needed to get it off my chest."
Date of travel: January 2022,50,Superb Service,"American Express Card and Delta Airlines are first class service.  There is no comparison.  Their refund policy is the best in the country.  Amazing service from check in the Twin Cities, USA, flying to Amsterdam, then to Tel-Aviv 👏.  The flight attendants were superb 👏. I try to tell everybody in my Social Network (Facebook, TikTok, etc.) and everywhere I go about my experience. If I was the judge, I’d   rewarded them as the best airlines in the world. And the pilot; my God, where did you find such a gem, such a jewelry? Amazing flight,  clear understandable messages, extraordinary smooth landing. Please,  please recognized the wonderful job of your staff that made our journey and memorable and pleasant --16th Jan. 2022 from Amsterdam to MSP. Thank you! 🙏"

Date of travel: October 2021,40,good service,it was a calm flight without a lot of noice nice staff didnt have a delay would recommend it just because its better of all the other airlines
Date of travel: January 2022,10,School semester,This is absolutely the worse airlines we have ever had.   My daughter had multiple issues that could be fixed that made her two days late for her semester abroad.   Now school will start and she still will not be there.  The company is not on time and their customer service is atrocious.   Have the TimeYou cannot understand the representatives
Date of travel: January 2022,40,Lack of overhead bin space,"Overhead bins were full so they made us check in our luggage and they stated we just needed to pick them up as we left the plane. However, our luggage ended up in baggage claim! We only had a 1 hour layover in LGA. We had to go down to baggage claim, wait for our luggage, then go back through security again. Our flight to LGA was in Terminal D and our connecting flight was in Terminal C. We ended up having to take a shuttle which was super slow. By the time we got to our gate, they were already boarding. We barely made our connecting flight. They should have just put our luggage on the plane to our destination instead of forcing us to retrieve our baggage and going through the hassle of security again! I've flown Delta many times and never had such a crazy issue before."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Cancelled my flight both ways <6 hours before takeoff,"I understand the staffing shortages and COVID causing headaches because people are out, but Delta cancelling my flights both ways was a terrible experience.I didn’t get an email or text or alert when they cancelled. I just had to stumble onto their app. I already had a boarding pass both times.My flights were cancelled 6 hours before a 6am flight, and 2 hours before a 2 pm flight. I had international connections to make not booked through Delta. I luckily lived close enough to take an expensive multi hour Uber, but absolutely no planning or notification when it happened both legs of the trip left me scrambling.They did rebook me after a delay, but both times it was for a flight literally days later so that didn’t work. There was nothing closer apparently.Trying to get my money back required waiting in a phone queue for EIGHT HOURS. I tried the texting service and also had to wait about 9 hours before I finally got a real person… who then told me they couldn’t do anything and I had to call. I was unable to do anything self service through the website, of course, which is why I had to call in the first place.I ended up waiting for the phone again, getting someone nice, and getting their help to get money back but it’s been a week and I still don’t have a refund. I had to carefully say I didn’t want e credit too, as they push it aggressively. If I wanted a simple flight change in those 2 hours, I wouldn’t have been able to talk to someone.TL;DR, flights cancelled both legs and rebooked for 2 days later, nonexistent customer service, and no refund back a week later. Horrible airline, won’t ever fly them again."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Treated with racism,We missed our flight because of a rude and prejudice delta employee and when I reported the ossue to delta all I got was an email explaining that this isn't their policy. I'm Horrified that delta allows thus behavior this day in age
Date of travel: November 2021,40,"Delta - ""Don't Expect Luggage to Arrive""","Delta – “Don’t Expect Luggage To Arrive”I never heard this until a few days before it happened for our first time.On Nov 27, 2021, three of us flew from Fort Lauderdale, FL to Birmingham, AL.The flight leaving FLL was delayed about an hour. In ALT we had to hurry to make our flight to BHM. At baggage claim waiting for our luggage we heard our name announced over the intercom system to report to Baggage Claim Office. Guess what? “Delta” had happened. The representative had informed us that 5 pieces of luggage had been delayed about an hour and a half, and 1 piece would not be there until the next morning. The time is approximately 9:30 PM, the representative asked if we were staying at a nearby hotel, and we said ‘yes’ an informed her of where. She told us that the hotel was on her way home and with our permission she would drop the 5 pieces of luggage off on her way home. She also gave us detailed instructions on how to get the 1 piece coming in the next day.We want to thank Ava Story from the bottom of our hearts for everything she did for us that evening. This proves there are caring people still in this world.The Carteaux Family"
Date of travel: January 2022,10,The second day of stupid,"So, our Friday night flight was cancelled.  After over an hour on the phone to find a new flight, the only option available was Monday night - 3 days later.By the time we got to the baggage claim, no bags.  Walked to ticket counter - no bags and no Delta Employee.  Our ride was waiting, so we left without our 6 checked bags.We returned to the airport in the morning to get our bags, my husband waited in the car, so he could drop me right at the bag claim.  I was told at the unclaimed bag desk that because our flight was cancelled, our bags would have been kept at the ticket counter.  I walked to to the ticket counter, and had the unfortunate experience of having to work with Dwayne.  Dwayne, the Delta employee at the Spokane Airport ticket counter was the most condescending and unhelpful person I have encountered recently.  Dwayne should not “work” (if you can call what he does for customers work) in a service position.I am wearing a beanie and a big jacket and his first response to me was “oh my God, you scared me”.  He then looked down at the luggage cart I’d brought with me for 6 bags and said, “what is that?”I let him know I was hear to pick up my bags, as our flight was cancelled.  He then talked to me like I was a child, informing me that “bags aren’t collected here”.I explained, again, the situation.  I explained that I had already been to baggage claim, that I had talked with someone at the baggage counter who called someone at the ticket counter to confirm the bags would be here.  He then asked me for my confirmation number, which I had on my Delta App and gave him.  He then asked for my baggage claim  tracking number, which I didn’t have on me.Dwayne finding a perfect opportunity to not be helpful or do his job held up a random baggage ticket sticker, tapped on it for me, I’m case I didn’t see it being held in front of my face, and said that I needed to provide him this ticket, which I would have been given if I checked my bags.  I told him, again, I don’t have it on me.  I then asked, if he has my name, my tracking number, and someone has confirmed our bags are here, why do I need it.  To which he said, “It is going to make it easier for me to find your bags.”  I asked him what he would do if I had lost it (I knew it was in my carry on in the car), he said that it would be harder to find my bags then.  I asked him to do it the “hard” way then, which was literally walking back to the place they would store bags for folks whose flights were cancelled, and he replied, “could you just go get the bag confirmation, please”.  I said, “so you aren’t going to help me unless I walk all the way back to the baggage claim car waiting area and get this stupid ticket”.  And he literally mmmhmmmd me.  The sound, “mmmhhhhmmm” was his response to me.So, I walked BACK down to the baggage claim, met my husband, got the ticket, and my husband joined me back inside to deal with Dwayne, cause I would not be spoken to that way again.  We waited in line for ten minutes to get back to the PRIORITY counter, and we were greeted by Dwayne asking “did you get it?  Did you get it?”  My husband handed Dwayne the baggage tracking tickets, and Would you be surprised to hear that Dwayne did NOTHING with them but COUNT them.  No scan, no look up the super special bag tracking number in the system to solve the mystery of where our bags were, nope!  None of that.  He just COUNTED them and asked, “so, six bags”?  Then walked down the hallway to where they put bags and AMAZING!!  The magic tickets led him to where our bags were.Good Job, Delta.  I can’t wait to watch another preflight video where you tell me all the wonderful things you are doing to make my travel safe and comfortable - clearly that is a lie.You shouldn’t force people to give you even one radio button.  ZERO out of five."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Delta sucks!!,"I am so over the BS of excuses Delta has.  Two first class trips ruined because you don’t have anyone competent managing your operations, customer service, and your quick reaction fixes (which do not exist).If you desire a comfortable travel in First Class (not an upgrade, but actually pay for your experience), don’t trust Delta to do ANYTHING but give you a coach option for your ruined trip and expectation,  because of their inability to plan and coordinate contingency.  Thank the lord that Delta isn’t in charge of our military- one unplanned variant, and they completely FAIL.Delayed and cancelled flights first class to and from Hawaii.Cancelled flight to Anchorage that we have the “luxury” of rebooking FOUR days later, )250 a day in accommodations gone, but hay - your supervisor said they were real sorry, and I could leave my complaints at www.delta.something, all because the pilot of a delta plane couldn’t land in fog.  Yet, crazy, every other airline coming into the same airport landed…..So, if not your reliability, if not your customer service, one would think we could rely on Delta for pilot capability - Apparently not.No points, no comps for late, delayed, and cancelled time, no give two cares from Delta other than our rebooking to our destination 4 days later.PS - no luggage.  Reason given “we are so behind and short staffed that by the time we get it back to you, it will be after your delayed flight”.  Well, ya know, maybe tell us that before we spend 40 minutes waiting at the luggage return…Good luck to you flying with Delta."
Date of travel: January 2022,20,Cattle car,"We all understand covid problems however for a 4 1/2 hour flight leaving at 11:15am and offering crackers is INSULTING!  BOOKED ""comfort+"" and it as nothing  comfortable about it.  Tight seats, no recline and terrible service.I will never fly DELTA AGAIN!"
Date of travel: January 2022,10,I am upset that the numerical criteria do not allow me to reflect how I actually feel,"I am upset that the numerical criteria do not allow me to reflect how I actually feel. The rating seems to be geared entirely around the experience on the aircraft, which was an admittedly fine experience. The issues I have with Delta were the entire rest of the experience.The mobile app looks and functions terribly. I have flown on most major airlines as I travel a great deal for work and scheduling is often more important than brand loyalty. This is the worst app I have used. The mobile ticket on the route to location did not function at all. Said I couldn't check in and would not display my boarding pass. So I had to show up early to the airport to get my ticket from the agent. This is where the second issue shows up.The Delta staff in each of the 4 different airports I visited were collectively the least helpful employees I have ever worked with. I have never seen a collective workforce seemingly intent on not helping as I did with Delta. I show up to the airport at 3:30 AM as my international flight leaves at 6:00 AM. There is already a line of 20 or so people at the Delta check in location as there is not one employee. When we finally see one at 4:00 AM he is walking slowly through the line asking each one of us where we are flying. After all of that he stands in front and just starts yelling for international flights to form one line, flights to Denver to form a different one, and so on. This would be great except he is still the only person here. So now we are just waiting in different lines. Finally a wave of 4 people come out and start taking customers. This is very slow and the ilne has continued to grow and is now probably 200 people. 3 more people show up and just stand behind the four working. There are plenty of open stations, but we now have 4 people helping customers and 4 people watching. Three presumed managers and the line maker.Get to the line and my wife and I are only given one of our tickets, but we are told that we will get our next ticket in Salt Lake. Make it through to my flight with about 20 minutes to spare, but I am TSA Precheck. I feel sorry for the 20 or so International passengers behind me who may or may not have been.Arrive at our first layover in Salt Lake and head right to the gate to get our tickets. We are told we are not on this flight. That is probably the reason they could not print our second ticket, but why solve that probably in Portland when you could push it to an employee in Salt Lake? Perfect. To their credit I did interact with the solely helpful employee in Salt Lake. I wish I had time to catch her name, but she moved us onto a flight that was currently boarding so we ran to that flight and are on the way to Mexico.As we sit down we realize that our checked luggage is probably not making it. We asked one of the flight attendants who directed us to the app to track our bag, which claims it is still in Portland. She tells us not to worry and it will be there when we land. It was not.We are told it is still in Salt Lake when we land in Cancun and it will be here sometime. They think tomorrow. It did indeed show up the next day. Luckily my wife and I packed a day's worth of clothing in our carry on.Now we fly back. Mobile app issues again. I can only get ONE of our boarding passes. My boarding pass says I need to complete check in, but when I try and complete check in it says I have completed it. Great. Back to the airport early to deal with this. I am told that the two legs of my flight are somehow on different reservations because I changed my flight? I told them I did nothing of the sort and I got a notification the day before that Delta delayed my layover. They tell me I did something wrong while changing it so I can only get one ticket again. I am told to go to my gate when I land and get my new ticket. Fine.Then we get to the gate and my Wife’s mobile ticket now says “Too close to boarding time. Ticket unavailable” WHEN ELSE WOULD I NEED MY TICKET? So now during boarding we are standing in line at the gate to print HER ticket. Scanned and she is in. They scan my ticket and I am not on this flight. Another employee slamming away at a computer for 2 minutes and I am back on the flight. I am sure we will have no issues in Atlanta.Arrive in Atlanta and go to my gate as instructed, granted we are 3 hours before boarding at this point, and stand in front of the employee sitting there:Me: Hello!Delta Employee: Hi.M: How is it going today?D: How can I help you?M: I was unable to get my second ticket in Cancun was told to get my ticket hereD: Someone will be here one hour before boarding and you will get your ticket.M: I was told to get it as soon as I landed. I have had a few issues with me not being on certain flights this trip and would like to just have my ticket in hand. They gave me my ticket numberD: Someone will be here one hour before boarding to help you.M: You are here right now, can we not just print it now so if there is an issue I could handle it?D: No. Someone will be here-M: Fine thank you so much you have been a huge helpI did get my ticket and I was on the flight. So there was no issue, but I cannot believe how difficult and tedious it was navigating the Delta experience. Their planes are fine. Their Flight Attendants are pleasant. Their snacks are standard. They are a perfectly normal airline in the air, but the interactions I had with the staff in the airport were all terrible. I found myself shaking my head and questioning how they could be awarded #1 in customer satisfaction in 2021. I was willing to give the benefit of the doubt in Portland with short staff and an early morning. But every single employee I talked to in airports was so annoyed that I talked to them and pointed out the issues I was having. As I mentioned I fly a lot and almost never need to interact with the staff in airports, but the few times I have with other airlines have all been at least pleasant. I have had flights delayed, and switched and I don’t really care. So long as I get to my destination I understand stuff happens. I just cannot believe how troublesome it was to get my questions answered.I mentioned above that I don’t have brand loyalty and typically fly whichever flight is at a convenient time, but I will now filter our Delta flights."
Date of travel: January 2022,20,Disgusting flight which left us stranded,First of all the cleanliness in our planes was disgusting. It’s laughable that they actually state they clean and disinfect the plane after every flight which is clearly untrue. Please make sure you bring your own disinfecting wipes. Next our flight was delayed due to plane mechanical issues and we missed our connection in Georgia. Delta stranded us there with two kids almost at midnight with no help except wait until the morning flight. We rented a car over $600 later and drove more than 4 hours to our destination. Delta refused to give us money back after waiting on hold for over 5 hours on the phone. What a nightmare won’t fly delta again.
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Delta has no compassion,"I booked a flight for my brother in law coming in from out of town, my wife and my two kids to come on my conference trip with me and stay at the resort in San Diego. My work ended up postponing the trip until April because the Omicron cases were high. My ticket total was 650 dollars. I called Delta to postpone the tickets until April. They said sure, but you will have to pay a 99$ fee for every reschedule. Totaling 300$, and on top of that, I won't even get refunded the 350$. Instead It'll be taken as an e-credit. The customer service was so dry and uncaring about it. I was on hold for 2 hours for a text message associate, that then told me to get connected to customer care, which was another 2 hour wait, then when i got connected I explained my situation and they said I can't help you, but I can add you to the customer care queue. They were the reservation queue. I told them, I didn't really want to stay on hold for another few hours. As I've already been on hold for 4 hours.... they said, Ok, let me check the queue, and abruptly connected me to the customer care queue.  Where I ended up waiting another 2 hours!!! And I still got the same result!!!  WOW, worst airline ever. I'm never flying Delta again."
Date of travel: December 2021,30,"Delta had become my go-to airline, but this last experience gives me pause","Over the past few years, I had begun choosing Delta over United, American or JetBlue whenever I had the option. All else being equal, the level of service I experienced on Delta made that airline my preferred choice. Boy, did they drop the ball on my last flight.I and my companion were taking a connecting flight from Atlanta to Richmond, when moments before boarding, I noticed that the seat number on my electronic boarding pass had changed. Both of us are large men, so I booked, and paid extra for, selected seats, across the aisle from each other, near the middle of the plane. Suddenly, I'd been reassigned a window seat in the tail section. After the first couple of boarding classes had embarked, it was announced that there was no available room in overhead bins, and all remaining passengers must check their carry-on luggage. This newer aircraft has the enlarged overhead bins, in which there are large diagrams showing how the bin can accommodate five bags if they were turned on their side, but none on the cabin crew were directing passengers to stow their luggage in this space-efficient manner. By the time the back third of the plane was boarding, the rear overhead bins were nowhere near capacity. From my cramped window seat in row 30, I could see that not one of the bins from rows 26-33 was half full; if they'd been properly loaded with bags turned on their side, none of these bins would have been more than a third full. Waiting for my carry-on at the baggage claim meant my ride from the airport was circling the terminal for another 20 minutes. I'm aware that cabin crew aren't compensated for time on during the boarding process, but whether it was expedience or laziness that led to these lapses in customer service, my impression of Delta isn't the same."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,"Lost college daughter’s bag, told her to come back tomorrow to get it","Paid $120 to check admittedly heavy bag. They lost it. Told her to come back tomorrow to get it, but call first. So basically, they lost her bag and we have to pay Uber both ways to pick it up (maybe). They should deliver it to her."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Covid Police,"the trip was all about wearing face masks, or ELSE.they act like Covid Police. you can pull down mask between bites of food,or between sips of coffee, but if you pull down any other time, they threaten you can make you feel like a criminal."
Date of travel: December 2021,30,Premium Select,"Paid extra to fly Premium Select (BTW, no selection for that in class of service so picked PE). Seat was fine, FA's rocked as per usual. However on the website  & my app Delta brags about  how great the food is. Supposed to be one step below business class AKA Delta One (I flew D1 in November to Spain). Disappointed, we got exactly the same meal as economy & not a dinner roll insight. The actual food was fine, although portions  were small. If I hadn't paid extra & was in economy I would have been happy with the meal  Not sure if this is because of Covid??? My meal in D1 in November was amazing. Confused as to why PS meal's didn't live up to the indicated standard."
Date of travel: January 2022,20,Delta Premium Select - the worst experience ever,"I traveled from JFK to Amsterdam on Delta's A330-900neo on the 4th of January, 2022. I had this ticket reserved for some time, and before the trip I decided to upgrade my seat to Premium Select. According to Delta's website, the experience - beside the extra seat-features - will include designated flight attendants, premium meals and spirits and so on. I watched some you tube reviews that also convinced me for this upgrade, which cost me $700. Once on board, I found out that there are no designated flight attendants, and we were served the exact same meal as the main cabin was. Most of the crew were grumpy and intending. They were hanging out in the back, no one came to check up on us. I asked one of the attendant, what is the ""Experience"" include. She said the seat and the amenity kit.The seat is not comfortable, the headrest is sticking out, keeping your back bended for the whole time - unless you can score like 3 pillows for support. If you are tall, the leggiest won't do anything for you. The amenity kit is a retarded delta one kit that definitely not worth the money.I know, I know, don't get me wrong. I'm not a 'Karen'. I'm also aware that these are not usual times, flight attendants are overworked and underpaid.However, Delta is blatantly lying, false-advertising when they say your upgrade will include elevated dining and designated attention.Please don't lie. I paid an arm and a leg for a very annoying experience. I would not recommend an update."

Date of travel: November 2021,20,Worst time on hold!!!,"I was making my 4th attempt to recover the damages caused by the LAS flight crew when they made me and my family check our carry on luggage on Novemver 2nd, 2021.  I was told it would be resolved by December 31st and was given a case #.  My luggage was stained and it was pristine prior to November 2nd flight.   I tried to upload the photos of the luggage and the call length screenshot I saved.  I was on hold for over 2.5 hours and then finally hung up.  I just want my damages to be fixed as they were entrusted with my luggage and they dropped the ball this time.  They were not even checked bags, they were basic carry on and the flight was overbooked."
Date of travel: December 2021,30,Underwhelmed by business class,"Took the red-eye so I decided to fly business class to try and get some sleep.  I was a little cramped for room.  The seats lie flat, but I think you have to be under six feet to really take advantage of that, otherwise, you need to twist yourself into a pretzel.  Once you are in the fully reclined mode, you have no room to move because of the configuration.  There was no pre-flight cocktail or snack, no warm towel.  It does come with access to the lounge, which is pretty nice at SFO.  Food was not good.  Flight crew were very nice."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Bad Bad service,"very bad service, buy a ticket, to Chile, in Delta  then called Delta and they tell me that it is operated by Latam, I call Latam, they tell me that it does not exist, I call Delta again and they communicate with Latam and they say that everything is fine , I call Latam does not exist said, then I call again Latam give them more information and they say that the flight is ok but the seat is not assigned , and need to  call Delta, because it is not operated by them ( Latam ) and as well as ping pong, waiting for each call 1 hour and with stress, they have a very bad service and coordination and on top of that they get upset ....."

Date of travel: January 2022,10,Nightmare on Delta Airlines,"On this day unless you were priority you did not make your flight even with 2.5 hours prior to departure on a domestic flight from SFO to LA. Orlando, a Delta employee argued with at least five customers in the 2.5 hours we stood in line. No Delta airline staff would answer any questions and the lady with glasses at the end would shut you up even before you could ask her a question. Not enough luggage check in staff even with our boarding passes in  hand . Accident to Delta staff we should have been their earlier ( they had no idea what time we arrived) and other famous phrases they were stating is “ Get in line”, “ That’s your problem “ and  “ Reschedule your flight. ‘"
Date of travel: March 2021,50,We have used Delta for a lot of our trips.  They are a great airline and for a very reasonable price.,The flights are always great.  Everyone is nice and friendly.  The price is great for amazing service.  We always enjoy our delta flights.

After calling two days in a row I finally received a call back and was told I needed to contact a different department. Still waiting for a call back going on day 3.Margaret Lohr"
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Abusive Customer Service,"I was flying out Dec. 20 and the supervisor at the Delta Atlanta International terminal was extremely rude and abusive to passengers. I'm fine with standing in line for an hour and a half to check in because I understand Covid restrictions and absentees. Actually, even the passengers who had missed flights because of the line were being patient and understanding. But Delta employees should do all they can to help and alleviate stress, not yell at passengers who have missed flights and refuse to help. I had booked a flight on the Delta website but apparently it hadn't been ticketed. I had an email itinerary that told me I was booked but the supervisors told me I had no ticket as if I had done something wrong. (The man who initially helped me was very kind. It was the supervisors who were cruel, particularly the main supervisor.) They refused to help and lectured me until I begged them in tears. They finally issued a ticket minutes before I had to board, and I had to run all the way through that large airport to my plane. I was the last person to board.Why? Aren't Delta supervisors there to help customers? Or are they doing us a favor by allowing us to fly their airline? It was like they were enjoying the power they had over passengers' ability to get where they needed to go. Delta needs to regroup and do some customer service training."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Baggage damaged,"Nobody answer chat or phone calls,website for claim baggage doesn’t work,my new baggage was totally damaged."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,The worst airline ever,Paid extra for comfort plus. Plane stayed grounded for an hour and thirty minutes because the pilots got lost. The AC was sporadic so everyone was sweating bullets next to each other. I am 0/4 with successful delta flights this season. My previous delta flight was delayed for over a day.  Why is this rated number 1 for consumer satisfaction?
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Sky Priority is the ONLY Priority,"Was forced to miss my flight because only one person was working the bag check line. Waited in a huge line during the holidays. Sky priority had 6-7 people working the bag check counter but no one was waiting in line. By the time I got to my gate at the other end of the airport, the gate was closed and I was told I had to go all the way back to the front of the airport just to get on another flight that was 4 1/2 hours later. Workers at the bag check counter did come to assist for a few minutes but then left on break a few minutes later. It was so frustrating to have to miss my flight because I was a regular person who wanted to check my bag during the holidays. It seems like Sky Priority is Delta’s only priority and that’s really disappointing."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,Horrfic,I walked onto the 757-200 hungry waiting for breakfast to be served so I waited for breakfast we took off and then I saw a box I was exited fort the food and guess what I got cheese and the flight was a breakfast and a lunch time flight the food was trash then the amities you get headphones and a bottle of water and that is it so comparing tis to American Airlines biasness class was way better and I got real food and I got better amenities Delta airlines you failed my test.

I was then put on standby from MSY to JFK to BOS, managed to get on that flight to JFK, and was supposed to have a 6 hour layover--I was able to switch to a 6:30 PM flight to BOS so I wouldn't be getting home at 11 PM, and was told by the Delta employee who rebooked me that my flight would be protected--that flight was then cancelled, and I was told I could not even get on the standby list for the 8:59 PM flight to BOS that I had switched from. I talked to a Delta employee and asked him to cancel the 7:00 AM flight I was automatically rebooked onto for the next day and request my luggage so I could leave the airport and take an Amtrak home. I waited for 5 hours on the baggage claim floor for my bag (with at least  10 other people doing  the same), and was told by the 4th Delta employee I spoke to, 4 hours into waiting, that the 3 Delta employees I had already spoken to who said my flight was cancelled and my bag was requested had actually done nothing. The one competent, nice Delta employee finally requested my bag for me—I then waited another 45 minutes, and then that same employee gave me a file number and took my home address to have my bag delivered to me so I could leave the airport, since it was already 11 PM. By the time I left the airport to go to a hotel so I could catch an Amtrak in the morning, it was too late to cancel my flight, despite the fact that I was told by multiple Delta employees that they cancelled it for me. I ended up having  to purchase a hotel room and an Amtrak ticket, and have not received a refund yet from Delta. I will absolutely NEVER  fly Delta again."
Date of travel: December 2021,30,Gets you there but not great service.,"I was flying early morning from RDU to LAS and meeting my daughter there who was flying from another location.  I cheked in the night before and paid my $30 checked bag fee. When I got the the airport they would not let me check my bag.  Delta said I had to have checked it at least 45 minutes prior and it was now 43 minutes prior to my flight.  I asked if they was any wiggle room in the rule as my daughter would be waiting at the Vegas airport for me.  Delta said no, get on that line and book another flight.  I even asked if they could send my luggage on a later flight & I would pick it up at the airport but they soid they couldn't do that. As you wil see, they did exactly that.  So they said the next flight they could put me on would get me into Vegas @ 10:43pm which would mean my daughter would be waiting there for about 13 hours. I said is there anything earlier. They said no, so I paid almost $100 extra to be put on the late flight and was no longer comfort plus.   So with time on my hands I got on my computer and found out the Delta agent had lied to me. There was an earlier flight that would get me to Vegas at 6:23pm.  So after considerable effort on my part doing an online chat with Delta I was able to get on an earlier flight. When I went to check my bag for the afternoon flight I had to pay another $30 baggage fee.  I spoke to an agent and said I had already paid and I have a record of it.  They said they had no record.  Clearly lying again or just incompetent or did not care. (I have both $30  charges on my credit card company statement).  Then...  When I changed planes in Atlanta, my bag did not make it on the flight to Vegas.  So when I got to Vegas I had to wait on another line to file a claim. They expected the bag to arrive at 10:43pm, & they would bring it to me.  I was staying outside Zion national park and planed on hiking Bryce the following day.  I was hoping they would bring me my bag that night or early the next morning as everything I needed was in it.  Warm jacket, hiking boots, etc.  Well....I didn't get my bag until around 4pm the next day.  So that day was ruined.   I suppose if I was a diamond platinum executive I would have gotten my bag the night I arrived.  Any way I contacted Delta about the double charge and my being lied to about the earlier flight, however several weeks have gone by & they have not responded.  I'll fly Delta if I have to, but quite unhappy about my experience."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,A disastrous flight on way home,Today marked the end of our vacation and we were returning home. As we got on our flight from Vegas to Detroit just after takeoff as beverage service started the flight attendant only gave us snacks and never asked us what do we want to drink. We had to call another flight attendant just to get drinks. Flight attendants were rude on the first flight. Our second flight back to Cleveland was delayed and all delta did was provide snacks. Our flight was due to leave at 9:20 but the flight was delayed until midnight and delta did nothing to compensate this delay. This was totally unacceptable and I would avoid flying with delta in the future if you choose to fly. Avoid this airline if possible and fly with someone else.
Date of travel: December 2021,50,Only Delta From Now ON,"We flew Delta from Detroit to Las Vegas Dec 21-25 RT. My husband was upgraded to first class for the flight out and he loved the service. I was content in Comfort+ because I had an ailse seat and he likes window which was offered in first. Love how they had new and current movies to see, as well as old favorites. So easy to watch a couple movies and Wa-La, you're in Vegas! Check-in, Gate and Flight Crew were all awesome, friendly and welcoming. The flights were smooth. With the rowdy winter storms and Omicron hampering travel, we got a notice the night before our return home that our flight was rescheduled.  We checked out early so we could get assigned a decent seat (exit row in Main) as we paid for Comfort+ but they put us in main. They had a special problem check in point and the agent was very helpful. Our flight home was broken into MSP then DTW. I had aisle in Main but the tv didn't work and I asked several attendants, all said they would check on it and it finally fired up an hour into the flight and then went out within 20 minutes.  We had a four-hour layover in MSP as the pilots were stuck in Boise due to the weather. We finally boarded at 11:15 PM, and arrived in Detroit at 2:30 AM. I was worried about getting carjacked on the way home or my husband falling asleep while driving because we don't stay up all night like that. All was well and in the end, considering how much weather and covid has impacted holiday travel, we felt lucky we arrived home only 5.5 hours late, even though it was 3:30 AM. Delta sent a nice apology letter and awarded us 15,000 miles each toward new flights. We're supposed to fly again in February and we are considering changing to May to avoid weather related cancellations. Covid as always will be a wild card as well."
Date of travel: January 2022,10,"Delayed 3 Time and Rebooked Twice, Once without Notice","Completely disgusted! Initial flight delayed 3 time then rebooked twice, once without any notice! Horrible customer service, one giving me an invalid confirmation number and two reps telling me different things."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Poor service.,Delta canceled my ticket but the plane still flew.  After 2 days of communication with Delta agents they said to go online and file a complaint.  I still have not received proper compensation for canceled flight.
Date of travel: December 2021,30,"Some good, some bad!","This was the return leg of our flight to see our grandson for Christmas.We were notified at 5PM the night before our 7AM flight from PDX to SEA that it had been cancelled and we were rebooked for 27 hours later going from PDX/LAX/TUS.Granted, they can't control the weather, but they could have done a better job anticipating the flight loads and time of year.  I attempted to contact Delta about a hotel and meal voucher only to wait for an online chat for an hour. Ultimately, the representative told me to contact a Red Coat representative at the airport and they would accommodate us. Never mind that we weren't at the airport. To add insult to injury there were no Red Coat reps at the airport the next morning. What a joke. The good news is they upgraded us to first class from PDX to LAX. This leg of the flight wasn't too bad, the plane was very small. Then we had to take a shuttle out on the tarmac to the terminal. It was like the terminal from hell. When we walked in it was shoulder to shoulder humanity. No place to sit except the floor. We got lucky and found a restaurant with a table where we hung out for 2 hours as our next flight to TUS was delayed.First delay was 3 hours, then a gate change, then another 2 hour delay. Not sure why they couldn't have put another plane on the route and switched our plane to another destination. The terminal was so crowded with multiple flights all departing at the same time in a very tight area. If we don't get Covid I'll be surprised.Overall we were supposed to land in Tucson at 1:44PM on December 29. We ended up arriving at 9:30PM on December 30th.I sent an online complaint in with my receipt for hotel and food. We'll see if I get reimbursed."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,WORST AIRLINE EVER,RUDEST customer service at JFK. I fly at least a dozen times a year (usually with BA) and have NEVER experienced anything like it. Overcharged for luggage already paid for. Waited three hours to reach their phones. Flight attendants were extremely sassy and offensive at the customer desk at JFK.Clearly dis not want to be there! What happened to the customer is always right. Paid over £1000 for these tickets and regret every cent. Worse flying experience. NEVER fly Delta - felt like torture. Absolute shambles. I am traumatised.
Date of travel: December 2021,10,DELTA = TOTAL BS,Worst airline ever. Delayed our 8AM flight to 9:30 PM for no rational reason. Waited 5 hours just to get boarding passes only to have it rebooked by 1PM the next day and REFUSED to let us bored due to expired covid tests which was their fault in the first place. They also lost our luggage along the way which contained my mother’s medication and refused to answer when called to ask for service. Such bs
Date of travel: November 2021,50,Quality - Kindness - Ethics!,"While we don’t care for most of their flights having layovers (although we did book it the week we decided to travel!), we will say the staff was extremely friendly, the flight was very smooth with little turbulence, and it’s clear they have a strong ethical and moral compass. We stand with Delta and will only fly with them!"
Date of travel: December 2021,10,-100000000 out of 10,"It has literally been a nightmare! We had a flight on Tuesday from Houston to Twin Falls. Our first flight was delayed causing us to miss our connection. The website doesn't work s we had to call Delta to reschedule our flights. We were on hold for four hours to be told we have to call a different number. We waited on hold for another three hours to get a flight change to one on Thursday. Then our rescheduled flight was canceled! They put us on another flight two days later, leaving on saturday. So we were stranded at an airport for two days. Finally on Friday we  just got a rental car and drove. Now I have been  on hold for four hours waiting to cancel our flight Saturday . Every tab on the app and website work EXCEPT the one you need to cancel your flight. It just loads forever and has a pop up that says there are technical problems try again later. It's a -1000000 out of 10! Do not fly delta!"
Date of travel: December 2021,20,Prepare for a Long Day,"2 delayed flights on Dec. 29 with 2 flight crews announcing they didn't know why we were delayed. Delta app and gate agents showing flights as ""on time"" right up to scheduled departure only to begin the sliding delay updates in ATL again with no information provided.A 7.5 hour flight and layover day became much longer.After arriving at our destination we learned our checked bag was left behind in ATL. Our bag was delivered to our hotel half past midnight making for a LONG travel day.Interesting to note airfares are not reflecting the ""new normal"" sub-standard airline service."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,delta made us sleep at airport,"We had a connecting international flight in ATL. We made it about to the gate on time, and they cancelled the whole flight. To call customer service is a THREE HOUR wait. Messages is an hour and a half, and with 2 or more full flights cancelled, the line to customer service is hours long with no help. No one at delta cares. No food available and they want you to sleep at the airport to figure out your next flight??! Avoid delta at all costs. We fly American usually and have never been stranded overnight with zero effort from staff. They can strand you anywhere."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Horrific experience,"I just had a horrible experience with Delta Airlines.My husband purchased 2 tickets 3 months ago one for me one for him..Today we attempted to take flight Delta decided that our tickets needed to be in my husband's name, 2 seats for him, none for me.And oh they decided to add another one and charge us.So now my man has 3 seats, I have none.We arrive at the ticket counter 3 hours before flight to get this fixed to be told they cannot help.The ticket counter could not help???  What are they for then??They give us a card with an 1800 number.We call, the wait is 3 hour 45 minutes on the phone, a recording tells us this.The wait time is longer than the flight will be taking off.We beg the ticket counter to help us.No way..the treatment we received was discrimaotry and aggressive.They had zero accountability to service and just did not care that we were going to miss our flight.So the 3 seats we paid for went unused.We tried to buy another seat, for 1000.The ticket counter lady told us there were 3 seats open.When I went to pay, she said sorry, cannot sell the seat.When asked why, she walked away and refused to help us.Asking questions is not aloud at Delta.They just walk away.I love people and I love serving people as a Bank President for 35 years.I am completely appalled by the experience I just had with Delta.And by the way, 3 hours and 52 minutes into the customer service call, they picked up and then hung up.Horrible!!!!!!!!!"
Date of travel: December 2021,10,The worst experience of my life.,Flight canceled and rebooked for two days later. Got on that flight. Waited 4 and a half hours on the plane at a gate. Got to the takeoff point. Mechanical error stopped the flight. Currently in delta hell trying to figure out how to get home. I will never use delta again and neither should anyone.
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Can’t get anyone to answer the phone,"This is not a complaint about any of the staff members.  This is a complaint against. Management.  NO ONE answers the phone anymore.  It’s a 2 hour wait at a minimum, and sometimes 12 hours.  I needed help changing a ticket purchased with miles.  It wasn’t working making the  change online and it didn’t explain why.  So I called and called and called.  No answer after many long waits.  Then I tried the chat line.  I waited a long time there too.  Then they transferred me to a special accounts rep, telling me that I wouldn’t be on hold.  They lied.  I waited for 45 minutes and then gave up.   STAFF ENOUGH PEOPLE TO ANSWER THE PHONE SO THE WAIT IS LESS THAN 10 MINUTES!!!!  YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE A PREMIUM AIRLINE.  ACT LIKE IT."
Date of travel: December 2021,30,Masks mandated but not enforced,"Flight itself was just fine, but with the omicron variant and constant airport and on board announcements that masks are mandated by law to be worn correctly, I was disappointed to see so many passengers wearing them under the chin (some for the entire flight-not just eating…). Never once saw a flight attendant say anything. Spirit airlines (which I can’t stand to fly) did a MUCH better job enforcing this."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Terrible,"This Airlines , is just so terrible cancel flight for 3 days , than on the 4th day plane gets delay for 2 hrs due to flight pilot didnt arrive on time , first cancelation was due to a weather now employees reason , never never agaig will flight on delta.i will rent a car will be much satisfactory till i researchfor a better company.they dont even offer some sort of consenteces or something for their worst worst service.if i dont here any answer on this web cause obviously their agents here are just not.....i will refer each and each customer or friends of how terrible they are ...."
Date of travel: December 2021,50,Flight DL 3644,Thank you to the lovely person called Margarita. She made our experience with Delta fantastic! Especially after so many delays on our flight. She really went above and beyond. Delta is lucky to have her.
Date of travel: December 2021,30,Military pre-boarding  inconsistency continues,"There continues to be  inconsistency in regard to this policy. Out of Pensacola only “active duty” Out of Atlanta,  in the same terminal:  “  all military” or “active military and retired”  When I questioned the gate attendant a gentleman at gate 4 in Pensacola on 12/27/21 ,for the 1:35 flight to Atlanta,  I was told that “ it is up to the gate attendant “ and “that it was not the policy of Delta to board anyone accept active duty , just like every other airline”.   If that is the case then why on our flight down to Pensacola on 12/20/21  the announcement of the gate attendant was “active duty retired military and anyone holding a military ID you are free to pre-board”?  As was stated in a  previous review (2019), the pre-boarding of military for the airline that is the major DTS contractor  has not changed.   So on some flights my retired Navy spouse with 24 years of service may get to pre-board and on others he may not?    And this Is subject to the gate attendant? There should be a consistent policy.  Pensacola has a large military presence both active duty and retired and it was because of this,  I was  also told that retired military were not allowed to pre-board.  To which I replied. “ Thank God for them”."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Do Not use this airline!,"I am a travel nurse and fly around probably 10+ times a year. I hardly use Delta and this will be my LAST time. My flight home was canceled 20 minutes before we boarded. I had been at the airport for the entire day because another flight was canceled. I had previously tried to drive to Atlanta and cancel a morning flight from Savanah. I was told by Delta consumer service that if I did that they would cancel my entire package. Anyway, back to being canceled. When our flight was canceled I ran (I'm a fat girl) but booked it to costumer service. I was #12-15 in line out of about 400 people. I still waited hours. There were no flights following day. They refused to cover hotel (illegal) nor put me on another airline. I am still stuck in Atlanta until maybe tomorrow. Also, I was originally first class and I had to call 4 different times to get reimbursement because they could only get me main cabin. They said it was my loss! So, you cancel us and steal? I think people need to start standing up to these big bullies that break laws. I will pay any lawyer willing to take my case...knowing I will come way out of pocket for what they owe me. I want my hotel, meals, ticket, and first class money reimbursed. It's not OK. The 8 hours of Delta costumer service calls were ridiculous. Never ever again Delta. Shame on you."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Worst flight ever. Not only that it was late by 1hr and 45min. When we landed. And didn’t have a gate for 2 hours,"Worst flight ever. Only 25 ground people showed up to work. how is that delta fault. When 100 people call us n over snow. That means the pay isn’t worth the drive. And you know when half the staff doesn’t show up. That doesn’t mean double pay. That means  double work, and same pay. No wonder my service is junk almost everywhere you go. Fight should of landed at 3.24. It’s 5:30 pm and I’m waiting on a runway for a gate to open up"
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Delta falls apart in Reno Nevada,"Flew from New York to Reno on 12/25. Throughout the flight the crews were great! That all ends at Reno. The luggage was delayed for roughly an hour and then there were 3 flights mixed on three belts. After waiting for two hours I went to the Delta claim office to find my bag. The woman was nasty and I’ll tempered. She indicated it was my fault met bag was gone, then told me to check again. After being convinced my bag was actually missing she wrote my info on a piece of paper and assured me they would deliver my bag asap. I told her I lived 2 hours from the airport and she said it was no problem. First lie. She called a few hours later to tell me I had to come pick up my bag. I reminded her I did not live in Reno and she said it would be scheduled for delivery the next day, Sunday.After 4 hours of waiting and disconnected calls I got through to some one who called her because there was nothing in the file. I was promised she would call me later Ethan day with the info. No call. Monday I made both calls and texts with Delta employees who assured me my bag would be delivered Monday evening or Tuesday morning…No surprise! No bag, no call, hour plus wait time to speak with anyone….Delta doesn’t care It is a shame one nasty I’ll tempered woman represents so many decent people at Delta."

Next day flight got delayed again and was gonna get scheduled for the day after but finally convinced them to be put on next flight by lying about family member being sick.

Date of travel: December 2021,10,Delta customer service,"I was flying home for the holidays this year when I received a notification that my reservation had changed. I needed to be back for work on December 27th, and had originally chosen to fly back on the 26. However, my reservation had been changed to flying out on the 27th, due to a flight cancellation- despite specifying that I needed to be back on the 26th. I called customer service and asked for assistance in changing my flight to flying out on the 26th. They said I would have to pay over $1,000. When asked for someone to explain why I would have to pay to have my flight changed due to a cancellation on their end of my original flight, I was hung up on. Very unprofessional. I have had good experiences with this airline until now. Will not be recommending and will not be flying in the future"
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Horrible experience! Never fly delta again!,"The most horrible experience ever! Rude employees, staff.

Not even for free I would fly with them again."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,No reason to pay for any amenities,"After being in Central America for 2 weeks we boarded our first class flight home to the United States. Since there was only ~40 people on the plane and being the only people in first class one would expect that service would be amazing. The flight attendant was attentive for the first hour but needed to be called for service beyond that since she was on the phone for the remainder of the flight. The salmon salad had a large amount of salmon lox but very little greens. It included green beans and potato slices that seem a little odd for a salad  but it was okay. For drinks the options were very limited. The only whiskey type options were Jack Daniel's and Woodford so I had a couple Woodfords over the 3 hour flight. Upon arrival we decided since we were flying first class we should check into the delta lounge to see what was available. Unfortunately, like the wifi on flights which they claim to provide, you are required to pay extra for that service. Since this used to be a service that was part of first class and because United airlines still provides this amenity as part of first class flights I recommend booking through united. I would also suggest booking through any other service because delta no longer deserves to be supported based on the level of greed they show."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,First class but only economy service,"We put extra effort into booking service through delta airlines. However, when returning to the United States after spending 2 weeks in Central America. Coming back from San Pedro Sulsa was okay with drinks and food available. The salmon salad was lox with very little lettuce or arugula but it included potato slices and green beans. Little odd but okay. After arriving in Atlanta we figured since we are flying first class and priority we should visit the Delta lounge. They refused to provide service saying you have to pay even more extra to be allowed in. Flying first class with United airlines we were given all the same level of amenities only the food was better the drink selection was larger and we were provided with access to the United lounge. After this trip I can no longer recommend delta as a good service and suggest looking into flying United as a better option."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Horrible service.,"The plane was 2 hours late in taking off.   It went to the runway, we waited, then it went back to the gate, and finally the problem was fixed and we took off.   I missed my connection.   The flight attendant told us that there will be agents at the gate helping the people who lost their connections.  That was a big lie!   There was no one there helping us.   When I went to an agent at another gate, and explained my situation, she said ""so what is your question?"".     She directed me to an area where there were 4 phones to talk to Delta agents.   After a 15 minute wait on the phone, someone answered me.   They got me a new flight for the next day.   However, then I had to go back to talk to one of the gate agents in order to get a complimentary hotel room and transportation to the hotel.   So finally everything got taken care of.  However, I was stranded in Minneapolis, and the gate agents showed no courtesy, understanding or kindness.   I would not use Delta airlines in the future unless it was the only viable choice, and then I would mentally prepare myself for receiving poor customer service."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Delta is going downhill,"Flight was delayed. Which is okay, but overall horrible communication. They don’t really update you accurately. They sent one update saying the flight would be delayed under an hour. It was actually delayed over two hours with no further updates. Delta needs to rethink their online system for their customers. They need more updates and more accurate updates. The last 3/4 delta flights I have flown have been delayed about an hour or two consistently so I would just expect it at this point. Plus, their terminal and sky miles lounge in LAX is pretty terrible."

Date of travel: December 2021,20,Delta’s monopoly in Atlanta translates into loss of customer care,"Been flying Delta for 30 years. I’ve watched them go from a personalized customer centric  airline to a corporate behemoth that herds people in and out of their planes like sheep. Then they pack you in like a can of sardines. Their focus are the Diamond medallion customers and their on time ratings. Economy fliers boarding last with carry on bags get in the way of the goals of the airline. The fares paid are cheaper and they can hinder the main goal of each flight…close the door and pull back from the gate…on time. The city of Atlanta runs the airport. They have allowed Delta a monopoly and they work together to limit competition through gate limitations and services they provide to other airlines. Delta lobbies the state against any addition regional airports. They protect each other, more money flows their way and the sheep get squeezed tighter. Our latest and most infuriating experience magnified the situation. Arrived and checked bags 2 hours early as dictated by the airport and Delta. Security check line serpentine through baggage claim and we were herded back and forth by the barking airport dogs nipping at our feet.  1 hour and 50 minutes later we get through security and run to our gate arriving 10 minutes BEFORE take off.  Gate agent informed us we were late and they gave our seats away. He insisted it was our fault and they have the right to do this 15 minutes prior to take off.  The 4 other flights to PIT were all over booked. We were offered a standby slot behind 33 other people!Delta got what they wanted. A full flight and an on time departure. Airport is able to claim they are the worlds largest moving the most passengers.  Delta and ATL how many sheep are sacrificed for each flight you deem a success. Those are the numbers that really matter."
Date of travel: December 2021,20,Horrible Seats,I’ve always hated flying delta but my mom flew me home for Christmas and she spent a little extra on comfort plus. One the plane for 2 hrs was small which I know they can’t control that so I couldn’t bring my suitcase the seats are very hard and uncomfortable and unlike other airlines their seatbelts if you are a little bit more on the heavier side it’s hard to buckle your seat and you have too keep the arm rest up. I couldn’t remember why I hated flying delta and that’s exactly why I had back pain all day yesterday after my flight I have to fly back home to New York next week so I’m not looking forward too that flight but then after thatIm never flying with them ever again
Date of travel: December 2021,30,Delta does NOT support the troops.,"Great flight. BUT, they didn’t let active duty military personnel on first. Disgrace. Other than that the flight was good."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,I had to wait eleven hours to bury my grandmother.,I had booked a flight from phoenix to idaho with a stop in Salt Lake city. Needless to say the plane arrived late to Salt Lake City and I informed them that I was going to be late to my gate and asked them to hold the plane (which was all the way across the airport? Get together delta.) So I ran across the airport to be told there's nothing we can do for you wait for the flight that's coming in five hours and you can board. The flight came they wouldn't let me on which left me sitting in the airport for ten fu**ing hours till the next flight. Even after I explained the rush and that I needed to get to Idaho to take care of my grandmother that just passed and my great grandmother that is in hospice care. I'd rather give all my money to a worse airline and never use Delta again. To reiterate I was waiting in the airport for over ten hours. Didn't even offer compensation or anything to help me.
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Worse airline stay away,"After waiting 5 hours on our flight to leave, it was canceled with rude staff and bad communication on the situation.We fly alot through out the year and this is by worse the most horrible airline we have experienced. We understand that there are unforeseen breakdowns but good communication and polite staff expected especially around the holidays. The worse part is they don't know when another flight is tomorrow so they said we can just wait tomorrow at the airport starting at 7 am and hopefully  the can have us home tomorrow."
Date of travel: December 2021,20,"Awful Customer Service, Rude Desk Agents","I had a connecting flight from SLC to PSP after flying from JFK in the morning. Our flight ended up at the gate over 20 minutes after we were supposed to be there, almost guaranteeing I would miss my connection.I sprinted through the airport and got to the gate with 3 minutes to spare. I told the desk agent I was there for the flight to PSP (leaving from B25), and she very condescendingly told me that the time on my ticket is the time the flight is in the air and that I should’ve planned better. I understand that there isn’t anything she can do if the doors closed, but the utter rudeness and tone I didn’t expect.I asked what my options were and she said nothing. Didn’t even look up at me. It occurred to me that she didn’t care at all about helping me get on another flight or assisting me with anything at all. So I left.This was an especially jarring interaction because Delta is based in Salt Lake, but I guess good desk agents are hard to come by with the labor shortage.There is more to this terrible experience with Delta, but I honestly don’t have the energy to type it all out. If you’re traveling during peak times and need helpful service and reliability, I’d try another airline."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Terrible,"Flight from Phoenix was fine other than the baby crying 75% of the time the whole. I decided to volunteer my carry on bag since it was a little bigger, an they needed the room. So no laptop or personal items i would have normally had with me. I get to Detroit at 5:30am, next flight to Pittsburgh was delayed due to no crew. Then the flight updated around 9:40 to canceled. Next flight out wasn't until 1:45, no one can tell me where my bags are. I had to ask 2 different help desk. Other plans an reservation had to be canceled. And now stuck at the airport no phone charger, no laptop. Now have to spend more money on food that originally was not accounted for. I flew delta because American had something similar happen in Dallas. This experience was horrible, next time ill drive."
Date of travel: December 2021,40,Another good experience,"Overall it was ok & I arrived safely. We did get water and cookies so that was nice. I was also able to watch a movie on the short flight, but the flight attendants did make too many announcements that it became annoying. The plane wasn’t full so I sat in a row by myself which is always great during a pandemic!"
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Disappointing,Very dissatisfied with the Delta company. It is not a first time that their flights are delayed due to the Staff Shortage… this is absolutely ridiculous and very disappointing… will reconsider Delta’s services next time.
Date of travel: December 2021,30,Ok experience,"We used Delta Airlines for our flights from our wedding to our honeymoon, and for our honeymoon back home.  We purchased economy plus tickets for the first, and first class for the latter.The economy plus seats were marginally, and I mean marginally, more comfortable than the economy seats.  We got a reasonable price on those seats, but for a couple extra hundred dollars it was barely, barely worth it.  Very underwhelming seats, and you still get the same ""snacks and beverages"" that normal economy does - one bag of snacks (like 3 bites) and one small cup of soda (like 2 or 3 sips).The first class seats were the biggest disappointment.  Our flight took off at 9pm from Kona so we were really hoping to get some sleep in the first class section.  The seats are quality leather, but our seats padding felt extremely worn and we could feel the support bars underneath.  They also don't recline enough to actually get comfortable enough to sleep.  We couldn't get a wink of sleep in those seats and ending up staying awake for the entire night, until the next day.  We did get a box meal which was small but good, I would value it around $10 or $15.  But for the BIG BIG price ticket of these seats they were a huge disappointment.Overall, ok.  I would probably try to use a different airline next time."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,We suffer because they are cheap,"Being delayed because they would rather wait for the sun then de ice the plane manually is unacceptable. People have lives and times and to be to cheap to de ice the plane just shows to me how little they care about their customers. We are sardines and are treated as such. Even lies about being able to have a carry-on when the planes can't fit the amount of bags. Not providing seating in the planes area while we sit through these delays. Should be at least a seat for every sold ticket available in the waiting area. Cheapness ruins people's trips and delta is one of the cheapest I've seen. From broken seats, broken entertainment systems. Mask mandates not being enforced. Delta fails over and over."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Delayed for over 5 straight hours….,"This is the WORST experience I have ever had with Delta in my life and airline period! Our flight was delayed 4 1/2 hours and when we finally boarded they forgot some required fuel check paper that took another 45 minutes.. The only thing they say is “sorry for the delay”. They treat this like it is no big deal, when in fact, you pay much higher ticket prices because you expect a professional service. This is not even close to professional. If you can avoid it, NEVER fly Delta to St. Louis or Salt Lake. Please don’t make that mistake. Don’t fly Delta in general because they show that they don’t care and aren’t willing to do anything to make up for it."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Delta basic economy versus main cabin,I purchased a main cabin ticket In order to be able to get an assigned seat and be able to move it around as needed. Once I signed in I was notified that I was now placed on standby and can not use the service I paid as an extra 100 ish dollars for between me and my wife. Then when asked to remove the upgrade for my return flight they give me the run around. Honestly the lack of service is not acceptable.After being placed on standby they send you information trying to get you to upgrade to a higher class or even more money after paying for more to be able to get a seat and move them around just crazy
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Canceled flights due to change in covid restrictions and they refuse to refund my money,Two tickets costing me almost $2700 and they refuse to refund me.  It's criminal activity at its finest.  Now I'm having to go to federal DOT and state Attorney General for assistance.  How does a company not provide a service and keep your money and say there is nothing they can do.  Is this Anerica or China?
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Arrogant,The absolute most arrogant flight crew (airborne waiters and waitresses) I have ever experienced.  Ride and arrogant doesn’t begin to describe this crew.
Date of travel: December 2021,50,Great Crew-Very Clean Cabin,"While boarding DL 2483 I anciently dropped the special seat cusion I carry with me for my sciatica becaue I had other accry on's. I realized that the cushion was missing when the plane was fully loaded and we started taxiing to take off, Fortunatly the head flight attendant had the cushion and gave it to me when I got off the plane. Even though this was a short flight the service was good, The cabin was extremly clean and well sanitized. Delta really makes sure their cabins and lavatories are kept clean."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,LOST LUGGAGE,"How is it possible that you can check three small bags and only two arrive? Then after 20 hours in the air (3 flights) were told one of the pieces is still in Paris. I understand mistakes, but we are now on three days and the bag seems still to be in Paris? This is not inexcusable but unprofessional especially the price we paid."
Date of travel: December 2021,20,RANDOM BILLING FOR LUGGAGE,"To my surprise, I checked my Delta app to print receipts for company expense report when I found a random $30 baggage fee.  My carry on was a small typical carry on suitcase and a small 12"" X 20"" painting wrapped in cardboard that was placed on top of my carry on one leg and then under my seat on the 2nd leg.  No baggage was ever checked yet, they billed me $30.  Very Sketchy Business Practice Delta Airlines!!!  This follows my most recent trip in November where the departing flight out of Nashville was delayed causing me to miss my connection in Salt Lake.  No problem, 3 other flights later that day out of Salt Lake, but despite being the 2nd for Stand By on the 1st flight, I never made the flight despite the gate agent handing out $700 vouchers to 4 people to fly on the later flight.  The best they could offer me was a flight out the next day!!  Again, another real sketchy business practice.  After protesting, they hooked me up with a flight on another carrier to another city to catch a 3rd flight to my destination.  Only problem was that when I checked the board on the other carrier, it was delayed until after the flight in Seattle departed.  Went back to the desk and miraculously, 1 seat opened up on a Delta flight to Seattle in which I could make the additional flight down to Portland.  I appreciated the help of the agents, but Delta has to have better alternatives when they overbook flights with known delays for mechanical issues on the first flight of the day.  EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED WITH MY LAST 2 FLIGHTS OVER THE PAST 35 DAYS!!!  Check Alaska Air if your headed to Seattle or Portland from Nashville, I've been having much better luck and no random charges on my credit card!!"
Date of travel: December 2021,40,Great experience,"Great short flight. The plane wasn’t full so that was great! We arrived 30 minutes early, but had to wait 35 minutes until our gate was ready to deplane so that kinda defeat the purpose. The staff and pilots were amazing. No turbulence so another plus. Even though it was a short flight, it was a smaller plane and I would have appreciated at least a cup or 8 oz bottle of water."
Date of travel: December 2021,40,Relatively GOOD,"It was pretty good. I have flown Business class on international flights before and this First class experience felt similar to that. It wasn’t anything extra ordinary, but it was a lot better than other domestic flights I’ve been on. I don’t understand why they didn’t give us the pre flight beverage service though."
Date of travel: December 2021,50,Awesome Airline!,Flew to Florida for a Disney World vacation.  The flights down and back were absolutely awesome.  This is a great airline.  Don't waste your time booking with an airline where you don't get an assigned seat.  Been there and done that.  This is much better.
Date of travel: December 2021,30,Delta Vacations Terrible Customer Service.,"I recently booked a trip using Delta Vacations, it was by far the worst experience I have had thus far. The customer service experience was awful by Ann Elizabeth and another girl name Corrine/Carrie. We paid a lot of money to have a nice and pleasant experience, but instead they were rude and hard to work with. They both had attitudes and spoke like they didn't want to be at work. Any issues I had went unresolved and ended with Ann Elizabeth hanging up on me.  Not professional at all, no respect for us who pay a lot to have a nice experience from beginning to end. They took our money and treat us disrespectfully.  My issue was I paid to have assigned seats, but they split all four of us up once we checked in.  I wanted to get our seats fixed for return flight but all I got was attitude."
Date of travel: December 2021,20,Carry on in hold for no reason,"Both ways passengers were forced to leave their carry on behind because there was no space in the cabin, but there was plenty of space in the cabin to accommodate the carry on of the remaining passengers. As it happened on both the ways I assume this is how Delta operates."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,"Horrible Customer service, ghosting, promises not kept, details not documented in my account.","If I could give negative numbers I would. My flight got changed from 3pm to 8am, essentially destroying a day of my trip with family for Christmas. I hardly ever fly, so I didn't realize I should have called as soon as the time got changed, but I didn't. I chatted with two people, both of which ghosted me. One promised 100$ refund upon completion of the 8am return flight, said it would all end up in the computer for paperwork. I called to verify next day, because like I said he Ghosted me. The lady on the phone said she didn't see any info related to a refund. She then said that all she could give me after talking with a supervisor was $50, but if I wanted $100 gave me a number to call that was like the corporate office or something. I called that number tonight and got ""this is a delta test announcement, good bye"". Well, so much for flying delta. I probably won't ever fly with them again. This is retarded. No refund, ruined day of vacation. HIGHLY DISSATISFIED."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Worst experience of my life,"Going out of my way to write this while I wait for my lost luggage. I flew Delta from FCO (Italy) to Phoenix,AZ and had a layover in Atlanta. Let’s start at the check in. I was flying first class and had 3 bags to check. Per Delta policy, 2 bags are free and the third one is $200. Well, I was charged €250, which equals to $283, but I just wanted to catch my flight so I paid the fee and hopped on the plane. The plane was outdated, not sure my seat was actually cleaned and sanitized, but again, as long as I get home safe and on time who cares. Quick note about how incompetent and rude the people at ATL are, but this is where Delta thrives so I won’t go into detail about it. I get to my gate just to find out that my connecting flight is delayed. I thought maybe I could hangout at the lounge and have some water, but turns out that the delta lounge at gate T6 doesn’t actually exist, they just keep the signs there to confuse people. At this point I’m exhausted and just want to go home, so I sit patiently at the gate where I waited hours to board my flight, because of other delays and because the pilots were not there yet. But again, I didn’t care because I wanted to go just home and rest. At landing, upon turning my phone on, I receive a text saying my 2 checked bags didn’t make it to Phoenix. Only thing is I have 3 bags, and one is unaccounted for. The big yellow priority tags didn’t matter to Delta or anyone at ATL I guess. At baggage claim I’m told that it’s all my fault because I didn’t pick them up during the layover to get them to customs… but wait, I was also told to get them at destination, since this trip was all Delta operated and booked in one reservation. Turns out they did go to customs, but the people at ATL didn’t bother to put them on the next flight. We were able to locate the third bag, which was never scanned, therefore couldn’t show up in the system. A big mess. Today I was excited to see that they were on a flight to Phoenix and was ready to go pick them up. But wait. They have been “removed planeside”. I don’t know what to do but one thing I know. I will never fly Delta again especially Delta One. The only “One” thing they’ll get is the one star review I’m about to leave. This experience is comparable to flying Spirit, except I paid $4k for this experience."
Date of travel: December 2021,40,Nice short trip,"Nice short flight. It was a smaller place, but cozy. Most of the passengers adhered to the covid precautions. The staff were nice, I would have loved at least a cup of water, even though it was a short flight."
Date of travel: November 2021,50,Delta operated by Korean with exceĺent service.,"This Delta flight DL 7668 was operated by Korean Airlines KE 092.  It was a Boeing 787-900 dreamliner.  Booking on Delta was $200 cheaper than Korean, but because it is operated by Korean, my preferred airline, I booked it this way.  The width and pitch was unbelievably spacious.  I had a good 2-3 inches of space between knees and seat, and I am not skinny.  The flight was only about 25% full and there was no one within 3-4 rows of me.  The Korean service was excellent.  Meals on my four leg journey were identical, no change.  AV service is not good, same selections as always, even for a new plane."
Date of travel: October 2021,50,Excellent service on Korean 787 dreamliner.,"This Delta flight DL 7667 is operated by Korean Airlines KE 091.  It was a Boeing 787-900 Dreamliner.  This was part of a BKK-ICN-BOS flight.  I do not fly domestic US carriers but this was operated by Korean  and booking with Delta was $200 cheaper.  The width and pitch was unbelievable spacious.  I had a good 2-3 inch space between knees and seat, and I am not skinny.  Also, the plane was only 25% full so there was no one within 3-4 rows of me.  The Korean service was excellent as I have always experienced.  The AV system is not the greatest.  The plane was clean and flight attendants wore masks and protective wear."
Date of travel: November 2021,50,Great experience!,"Great experience overall! I felt very comfortable with all COVID regulations as they all seemed to have been taken seriously. Our flight there took off on time and on the way home there was a bit of a delay, but the flight attendants, etc. were all very communicative about the delay and we still ended up landing right on time. Would fly with Delta again!"
Date of travel: December 2021,50,Great flight experience,This 2 and half hour flight wad memorable for the following reasons. The staff were kind and helpful. Antiseptic was present in front of the cabin. In this short flight a bog lunch box was provided and there were three choices to choose from. This is in real contrast to United or American Airlines. There was gree internet service although in and out and free TV dish Need channels. Alll these features made the flight a great trip.
Date of travel: November 2021,40,Delta DL 7692 operated by Korean KE 653.  Excellent service.,"This Delta flight DL 7692, is operated by Korean Airlines (KE 653)  It was an Airbus A-330.  This was part of a four leg BOS-ICN-BKK flight.  I do not fly domestic US carriers but this is operated by Korean, which is what I normally take but booking with Delta was about $200 cheaper.  This aircraft of all 4 I took had very poor pitch, my knees were practically touching the seat in front of me.  Thankfully the flight was only 25% full.  In flight service by Korean was excellent.  The AV is not that great, it has not been updated in years."
Date of travel: October 2021,50,Delta operated by Korean.  Always great service.,DL 7854 is operated by Korean Airlines (KE 652).  It is a Boeing 777.  I normally do not fly Domestic US carriers but this Delta flight is operated by Korean which I usually take.  Booking on Delta was about $200 cheaper.  The flight was about 25% full.  There was good comfort in width and pitch.  Korean in flight services is excellent.  The AV is not great and has not been updated in years.  Cleanliness was perfect.  This was part of a four leg BKK-ICN-BOS flight.
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Delta is the worst - never again!,"We paid over $2500.00 for two first class tickets on Delta, assuming, like every other airline we fly, both domestic and international , that we we would be welcomed in their Sly Club lounge. But NO! You Have to pay some annual fee or something on top of your ticket.  Apparently $2500. Isn’t enough to let two senior citizens, 79 and 82, in for one hour or less.For our next flights to and from NYC, London and Paris we’ll stick with BA and Airfrance or American or United. They were also very rude to us  at the lounge entrance, and earlier Delta employees misdirected us to the TSAPrecheck location."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,The worst experience of 2021,This is not putting it lightly. I’ve had friends get COVID this year and had to quarantine for long hours and had uncertainties at work — but this flight by far was the worst experience of this year. I will honestly pay more to get a decent flight by Alaska or hell even Frontier airlines.
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Costumer service,Probably the worst costumer service I have ever experienced. The phone service needs to be corrected. Call your costumers back if you can't hear them. Were talking 4.5 hours of waiting.
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Never again - Delta is worse than Frontier and Spirit combined!,"Looking for delayed flights incompetent and unprofessional staff, fly delta. Their company policy and procedures are trash. If i could give them negative 5 stars I would. And delta in Atlanta is the worst airport anyone can have the displeasure of flying through."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,Very disappointed,"Booked with Virgin but flew with Delta.  Having flown with Virgin on all my previous trips to the USA I was expecting the same high standard from Delta ... I was disappointed.  We took off at 10.10am and was provided with a meal at about 11.30am, the food was not good!!  We were given a small bottle of water and drink of our choice with the meal.  At about 4pm I approached a member of staff asking for a drink only to be told they were serving a snack soon and I would get a drink then.  An hour later we were served a snack and a drink.  For a 7hr flight = 2 drinks, I really don't think this was good.  Same on the homeward bound flight but this time the food was definitely bad and I couldn't eat it.  The same situation with drinks but I was prepared and had taken my own drinks onboard.  But as we came into land I was very disappointed that staff never did the usual seatbelt and seat in the upright position checks.  A woman opposite me had her seat pushed back and definitely didn't have her seatbelt done up as we landed, and she wasn't alone."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,JFK/LHR flight 3/12/21,"Very disappointed with our return flight on the 3rd Dec, VS4000/DL001, the service was disappointing compared to our outbound on VS03. We found the crew to be in helpful, busy chatting amongst themselves. The service was poor, nothing was passed, more like being chucked at us, even asking for a decaf coffee was a trouble, we were told it’s at the back of the plane and they would have to walk there. This left us very much feeling that we were a nuisance to the crew, and they made this obvious.Based on this flight, I would have no interest in flying Delta nor recommend them, I was expecting to get at least the same level of service received from Virgin, I feelDelta have let Virgin down on this flight"
Date of travel: September 2021,50,cheap and on time,"flew on delta from atlanta to guatemala city and back, the flight was on time, the service was good, there was no problems or drama, it seemed covid safe and best part was that it was soooo cheap and affordable."
Date of travel: December 2021,10,They brought 9 cops,I had two beers before I found a seat and fell asleep. I woke up to 9 cops standing over me telling they were either going to arrest me or take me to the hospital. The airline took my ticket and said I wasn’t allowed on the flight. Delta sucks. I’m a tiny woman and I had no weapons. Does Nashville airport security have nothing better to do than harass a disabled person with PTSD? I hope y’all get Covid.
Date of travel: December 2021,10,"Delta takes your money and then resells your seat, and only gives you an ecredit","Very upset with Delta's policy ecredit.  We booked a flight for my wife and daughter, my daughter can't go now, and Delta won't refund her portion (800 dollars), they will only give a ecredit that only my daughter can use and it must be used in one year.  Delta will just sell the seat to someone else, making twice the amount now on that seat, and we are out 800 dollars, because my daughter will not be flying again this year.  They limit the amount of time to use the ecredit and don't let other family use it, it must be her.  This is an aweful policy, and I will never by another ticket on a Delta flight because of this policy of taking our hard earned money.  Shame on you Delta.  I will find another airline and recommend that everyone else does the same.  Us taxpayers bailed you out and this is how you treat us?"
Date of travel: December 2021,10,"Ok, it has been a decade since flying Delta and then stark PTSD of why I stopped,  flashed back","Deciding to burn down  miles for a first class round trip from Denver to Fort Lauderdale Via Atlanta hammered again why Delta is not my goto airline.  I flew NWA with platinum status until Delta bought them, and then quality of service continued to tank;  I did have Delta Platinum before bailing....For this trip, so far, Denver check in was great, boarding was hectic not allowing 1st class to board until after droves of others already had, then they blur the lines based on status too, resulting in a hoard of people jamming to get in first.In Atlanta, it degraded from hectic to absolute chaos as if the gate had never boarded a plane before.Further, Covid Cr4p or not, what happened to beverages as 1st class settles in? No booze, no problem,  how about a coffee at 6am? By noon? Offer a drink!And food? It was a joke especially eating off wooden cutlery, wondering how splinters I was going to get.More to come,  unfortunately...."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Terrible experience,"Awful experience. Flight MSP to BHAM, flew with one bag I planned as a carry-on - on boarding, they said they overbooked the flight and they would have to check bags. I asked if there was any way I could bring my bag on board, as I had a medical device in there I needed with me for getting to my connecting flight at ATL. Delta staff at MSP raised their voices at me and told me I had to check my bag, but that it would be ON THE CONCOURSE at ATL. I thought this unusual, but I believed them! So I fly to ATL and hobble down to the concourse, where I ask baggage claim about it - they say that it would go straight to BHAM, as I expected. Now with limping down to baggage claim and back, I missed my connecting flight. Talked to service desk, was told the next few flights were sold out. So, I drive down to my destination the next day after having to stay in a hotel. Spent hours on the phone attempting to confirm if my bag was, in fact, in BHAM. No luck - a couple of dead end lines, and then getting incorrect numbers from delta staff and being transferred to wrong depts. No info.After all this, I was mad, but I thought ""It's fine, I'll deal with it. I got to my destination in time and I still have a flight home."" Boy, was I wrong! Due to me missing my connecting flight (because of Delta's misinformation), Delta cancelled my flight back, but didn't let me know until the night before when I checked in! I had been checking the app daily to make sure my return flight hadn't been changed, and everything looked good on there until I checked in, where an automated pop-up said that I violated their no-show policy and that my flight would be cancelled. Then it deleted all of my flight information! Luckily I still had the confirmation number on my baggage, that I had to drive to Birmingham airport to get. I ended up splitting the trip back riding with a couple of people and taking a Greyhound, adding days and stress onto my trip.Not only was my flight experience horrible, with getting incorrect information from delta staff, but trying to get any help took over 2 months and well over 15 hours on the phone and emailing. At the end of it, the travel problems Delta caused cost me hundreds of dollars up front and even more in lost wages, and after months of being passed around and ignored, they gave me a $25 travel voucher. The customer service rep that finally called regarding my issue raised her voice at me when I was staying calm and explaining my issues."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,What to expect if you have to contact support(from a Platinum member),"3 years ago I made the transition from no airline loyalty to Delta. In that time I have flown around 250k miles and reached platinum status. Up until recently, I would convince anyone in a 50m radius to do the same. Here is the reason why their new approach to customer service has moved me away from them.In the last 6 months there has been a significant downgrade in their level of support. A live example - 8 of us were flying to Costa Rica and of course I convinced the crew to all fly delta even though American was cheaper. They changed the flight weeks from time we were suppose depart and the change left a 20 minute layover in ATL. I called to see if the flight needed to be moved and was told that Delta would change their flight again and to wait. You guessed it, the flight was not changed. I called again and was told if I stay on this flight I would miss my layover and the next flight goes out the following day. After hours of back and forth, we came to the conclusion that the group of us would have to fly in a day early and get a hotel and that “Delta would take care of you”. I called the group and we moved our flights and then I called back to get confirmation and was told they would not compensate us for the hotel because “this is not a Delta issue it is a flight change”. We all had to pay for a hotel which not only did we pay more for our flights because of our loyalty but now we incurred an additional expense directly related to Delta because of a flight change.  Is this the kind of experience you would expect from the #1 customer rated airline?"
Date of travel: November 2021,10,NOT FAMILY FRIENDLY,"Unfortunately, I will not be flying Delta as a mother going forward. Plane tickets are expensive, and my family of three bought basic economy seats. American Airlines sat my husband, kiddo and I together, regardless of my “status” at no extra charge. When I checked on my seats for Delta, I can’t select a seat or even see where I’m sitting without paying an extra $40.00 per person! This is ridiculous. Is Delta so hard up for money they can’t let families sit together without charging them for it? When I called reservations, I was told that this is their policy for basic economy. They expressed zero sympathy that my minor child would be sitting alone. In short, if I were wealthier they would cater to me better. Most unfriendly-family airline. Would rather drive than deal with this poor-money grubbing airline."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Worst Flight,"Flight 2962, worst crew members!!!! It was a hell of a flight not a good way! Those nasty Flight Attendants made it worst. Instead of making you comfortable/secure in your flight, they made sure they added up to your duress. The crews we had, was very unprofessional (not sure about the race, I think he was Indian guy?  wont make a conversation to fix a problem, passive-aggressive and disrespectful. Whats worst was the flight attendant ( an older lady with long blonde hair) that was all the way in the back shooked her head when the other flight attendant told her that my nephew needs use the bathroom!! I literally caught her doing it. He looked at my nephew in the eye and slightly shooked her head and it blew my mind. Another thing was that they wrote up a kid for keep putting her mask down because she cant breathebecause she has some health issues. Worst crew, not the airline!"
Date of travel: November 2021,10,I would give a zero (0) if I could,"We booked this Delta flight due to its 7:35 PM departure time.  We arrived at the airport three hours in advance, only to find that the flight time had been changed to 5:55.  The Delta app was not working so we received no notifications of the flight time change.  They told us we would still make the flight so we went through the whole security and baggage process.  We were on track to make the flight, but Delta again changed the flight time UP another 10 minutes to 5:45.  We made it through security and arrived at the gate at 5:34 only to be told that that the door was already closed and we could not get on the plane.  It took us 1.5 hours to get my wife's suitcase, we had to pay for two more cab rides and another hotel for the night.  Delta cost us a ton of money.  Thanks Delta!  We travel very regularly and will be sure to use other airlines moving forward."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Poor Customer Service and Flight Rip Off,"I had booked a flight that I needed to reschedule for a slightly later time. On  Delta's website there was an option for a 6:45pm flight for an additional $75. I thought ""Oh great."" Immediately after booking I was notified the flight was delayed by 4 hours! After sitting on the phone for over an hour trying to see if Delta could apply my $75 to a different flight, they told me there was nothing they could do unless I wanted to spend another $75 and assured me my flight wasn't delayed, even though on  the app, Delta's website, my boarding pass and google.com stated the flight was delayed. Being misinformed and lied to on the phone was disappointing. Don't recommend."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Flight delay,Just as we boarded the plane the captain came out and asked us to deplane because they found a damage in the plane. Then we were told to wait at least 3 hours for another inbound plane.Also Delta is know to frequetly switch your flight time by many hours that will be very inconvenient to you.
Date of travel: November 2021,50,Great flight,Live delta.  The flight was seem less and on time.  Great communication.  The app made the trip easy and I knew what was happening real time every step of the way.
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Worst experience,the employees in the airport had the worst costumer Service. i was denied sky cap Service because they assumed that due to my age and race that i wouldn't tip and proceeded to lie saying skycap was a tip only service and sent me on when i clearly had a lot of heavy luggage. the employees also ignored me when I tried to get their attention to ask for help one even made eye contact with me and kept walking past. I payed for first class ticket and my experience was not reflected of my ticket. i would not recommend this airline to anyone unless they just enjoy bad Service.
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Terrible service from Delta Airlines,"The worst part of this experience was the fact that Delta no longer checks on their employees' behavior and performance. The reason for this review comes from my experience with two ladies specifically. The first lady's name is Sandra. Sandra is at the check in line. She is treating people like she's a warden. She is rude, treats people with disrespect, and a total lack of care. Delta has basically allowed her to feel like she can do anything she wants with no repercussions. The other lady was at the Gate, her name is Janeth. She's an overweight and bitter woman sitting behind the counter at the gate. These two women have the attitude of two thugs. Janeth basically insults customers in Spanish over the speaker system. I could not believe that she's treating people in this abusive manner over the speaker system and Delta doesn't even check in on her performance. She down right insults customers by telling them they are not going to ""get away with trying to sneak in bags into the plane,"" because ""she WILL catch them."" As if people were there to do that. People are the to fly to their home country. She is not even from the destination country at this gate. Delta, if you read this review, you should have someone from the destination country at the gates, but even more importantly, someone polite, respectful and empathetic. In addition, when it came to providing the same information in English over the speaker system, Janeth would completely change her voice, tone and rude manners. She would ask kindly in English, but completely rude in Spanish."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,"Delta considers massive errors just a ""inconvenience""","Please note I was a Delta loyalist.  Still Platinum and a million miler.  This is NOT about losing my bag (for the entire trip) but about the tone deaf, lack of management loyalty and empathy for their customers.  It is now 45 days with multiple outreaches by me to management to resolve a horrific issue.  Not once have they ever reached out to speak to me.  Their customer service lines (Phone/text) NEVER worked, nor did their computer systems.  I reached out to Allison Ausaband their head of customer service, the president, the CEO and the head of marketing.  NEVER got a response.  I have taken over 4000 (yes 4000) flights on over 70 different airlines and I have never been treated more poorly - even by Aeroflot!"
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Worst airline ever,"Horrible airline they do not care about their customers and have horrible customer service. Do not fly with them unless you like delayed flights, overpaying for your tickets and arriving to your destination late."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,No title,Worst airline ever. Late. No apology and no reason. Then took forever to clean the plane.  Missed my connection. They could not care less.
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Travel to Europe 2021,"Absolutely horrid! 1) The trip was bought and paid for probably 4 to 5 months in advance through a travel agency. A couple of weeks before the flight Delta Airlines decided on their own to change our itinerary which caused problems with layovers and caused confusion with the travel agency. We were made to pay for this flight change even though we did not request the change or risk losing out on the nearly $3500 we paid for round trip tickets. 2) Check in was offensively dramatic and excessive with the nonsense covid restrictions. On the way back from Frankfurt I was literally checked 6 times to verify passport, vaccine, and negative test results between initial check-in and getting on the actual aircraft. (I realize some of that is the airport itself and not the airline. 3) Cramped...I'd almost rather travel by boat for two weeks to Europe on future vacations, the legroom and arm-room is absolutely horrendous for the amount of money you pay to fly regardless of whether or not you sit in coach or are even lucky enough to land a seat in business class where you might get an extra inch or two of space. I imagine equal comfort in the back of a cattle truck. 4) The constant reminders while onboard the aircraft to stay masked or face removal from the aircraft, a lifetime ban from flying with Delta, and potential federal criminal charges was so excessive (nearly every hour on the hour) that it bordered psychological-operations. You can't get on the plane without proving you've been vaccinated and have tested negative within 3 days of your flight so literally every soul onboard is covid free which begs the question whether masks are even necessary to begin with, but that aside I understand the need for rules...having those rules constantly bombarded at me over the course of a 9 to 10 hour flight is both excessive and ridiculous. It definitely does not inspire future travel. If the Concorde was still in operation I'd almost rather save my money and fly with them so that I could get Europe in an hour just so I would not have to endure this ridiculousness. In a nutshell I have lost the taste to travel while the world pretends there is a pandemic wreaking havoc on the population."
Date of travel: September 2021,50,Took care of me,American Airlines put me in a jam because of delays in Dallas. I needed to get to Idaho Falls by the next morning. Received no assistance from AA. The assistant in Dallas and SLC worked diligently to get me to my Destination because I missed my connecting flight in Dallas to SLC.
Date of travel: November 2021,50,Excellent service!,"I would highly recommend Delta. The customer service went without a glitch. I did not have to wait in line long to check in. Check in went very smoothly. The flight crew were  so friendly and kind. They made you feel like they were there to make your trip as comfortable as possible. I didn't order kosher because it was a trip for a family emergency and I didn't have time to order, but they had extra kosher food and provided it to me. Just went so smoothly and very relaxing."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Lost baggage policy and customer service is horrific,"I recently graduated from college in Virginia and got a job located in southern California. Initially, I was remote, but when the office opened up, my company wanted me to move there. I obliged, packed up all of my clothing in a suitcase and headed out west. My trip was a flight from DCA to ATL to SNA with an hour long layover in Atlanta. Long story short my bag did not make it on my flight to Southern California. After filing a claim, waiting many days, and checking in on my own every day (delta never reached out), I filed the missing luggage form, and claimed a value of ~$3,600 dollars. This value was based on the new value of my entire wardrobe that I had itemized on the claims form. Days later, I received an email saying that I would only be refunded 25% of my claimed value, since I could not provide individual receipts for clothes I have purchased over the past 5+ years.  Considering that Delta 1. Lost the bag and couldn’t recover it.2. Has a maximum claim value policy of $38003. Never stated that only 25% would be recognizedThis feels incredibly unjustified, as I am now left without the majority of my clothing. I have reached out via phone and email 15+ times since their communication of a “settlement,” and have not received a response once. Incredibly unprofessional customer service team. I am very disappointed, and will not be flying delta again."
Date of travel: November 2021,40,wheelchair pushers in Atlanta,"had to wait 40minutes for pushers ,7 calls by gat agent and had to get termianal A Supervisor involved .  Barely made next flight in A terminal.  Recoomnd not using delta if you are going thru atlanta.  Yes it is a contract service but no excuse for Delta.  Really like Delta but this is a airline change for us handicap people"
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Ms,"Passengers are told to arrive 2 hours prior to departure. My flight departs at  530am. I arrived at 315am. No one is at the delta desk. The line stretches way down the wall past the entry door. That's a long line even with social distance g. No one had come to give us an update. No water, nothing.. It's now after 4am. American Airlines employees are at their post processing passengers. This is ridiculous."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Delta is slipping,"Delta is going down-hill in customer service. I have been using Delta for years and this is easily my worst experience with any flight. TERRIBLE customer service. Out entire return flight was cancelled and rescheduled for 24 hours earlier, cutting our vacation short by a day. We received no notification of this change and I only learned of it by confirming details because our trip was approaching. There was no flight available out of Alacante leaving and arriving on the days we originally booked. Delta offered no other options for helping us. I found a flight serviced by Delta out of Barcelona with days and times that were similar to our original booking. Even though we would lose money on train tickets and lodging, I suggested this. I was told I would have to pay the difference in fair and they would not offer an voucher, miles, or upgrade to compensate.The flights they offered out of Alacante were all overnight layovers in Amsterdam. I was told they would not provide a hotel voucher or any compensation for this solution either. This was an AWFUL experience. Delta is going downhill."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Horrible customer service,"Last July I had to enter the hospital emergency ward with a lung disorder that had me in the hospital for 16 days. I could not fly on my appointed date and attempted to reach out to Delta to request a credit so I could fly when healthy again. The telephone waits were up to 7 hours. I wrote to Delta Customer Care 4 separate times, sent 2 separate fax communications to customer care (with confirmations they were received) and finally wrote a letter to Ed Bastian, Delta's CEO. I outlined the situation and informed Delta I am a senior citizen and disabled.  I have never once received a response from Delta. Not one single response. Delta has demonstrated what may be the most horrible example of customer service in existence. Absolutely disgraceful. I will never travel with this airline again."
Date of travel: November 2021,40,Good Experience.,"Flew on this flight actually operated by Endeavor Air on behalf of Delta. Small aircraft for a short flight. Check-in was smooth, no queues. Service on-board was good. Crew we good tending to peoples needs and seem to being enjoying there job."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Flight attendants suck.,My boyfriend and I are flying home for thanksgiving from Maui. I ordered one drink when the cart came around. A while later about 45 mins I asked the attendant passing by for a second beverage. She declined and said that they had to pick up trash first and she would be back in a minute. She never came back. I tried to get the attention of flight attendants multiple times and I didn’t want to ring the call button and be rude but I eventually had to due to being ignored. She came over and declined a second time. I’m paying for this flight and my drinks. I had ONE drink. I’m just appalled by this service. Especially on a 7 hour flight. I have flown delta multiple times and much prefer United. Better service. Better food. And nicer attendants. If you don’t want to do your job get a different one.
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Laziness of Employees/ Stroller Delivery Issue,Walking with my 19 month daughter from the gate to immigration holding her on the car seat. It was unacceptable to have employees refuse to deliver your stroller at the door side of aircraft and also  the agent is claiming that the the strollers can not be delivered at the aircraft due international flight plus a he immigration will check out the stroller. That was not a common sense.That was one of the worst flight that I took.It was an awful experience.
Date of travel: November 2021,50,"Crappy experience, Delta made it right","Horrible experience involving mechanical errors and weather delays, leaving us stranded for 8 hours. Delta was contacted and the customer service made it right with travel vouchers to cover the costs and our time. Thank you Delta for being loyal to your customers and standing behind your pledge."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Bumped From 1st Class For Return Flight After Booking Over 2 Months Ahead!,"I purchased my 1st Class round trip ticket (G48QJO) for $1446.40 on 06/24/21.  My flights to LAS went fine, however I was called by one of your representatives @ 1:04PM on Sept. 9th and informed that I no longer had a confirmed seat on my scheduled return flight #836 LAS-ATL on 9/11/21, as it had been given up for reasons beyond our control and they wanted to move me to a later flight with only a 30 min. layover in ATL.  How was it beyond their control as they manage the seat assignments?  Did God intervene?  I said that was unacceptable and that I would have to call back as I was in a meeting.  When I checked my Delta app later, I had been moved to the later flight with an unassigned seat and a connecting flight with no seats available.  Your Android app would not let me change the reservation, so I booked another return ticket while I waited 1 hr 45 minutes on hold for one of your reps, then spent another 45 re-booking the flights which caused me to now leave 2 hrs earlier and spend 3 1/2 hrs on a layover in ATL. The agent then offered me a 5,000 mileage credit for the inconvenience, which is ridiculous, as my time is far more valuable than the equivalence of $50 and I feel I deserve a refund of at least half the price of my ticket ($723).  When I did eventually arrive back in CHS and retrieved my $200 hard side Samsonite luggage, I discovered that the lock had been damaged and looked like it had been hit by a hammer.  It had been damaged to the point the lock no longer functioned and I had to pry my suitcase open with a screwdriver.  I keep receiving messages from Capt. Patrick Burns welcoming us back to flying, but if this is how they treat your 1st class passengers, I shudder to think what economy passengers are experiencing.In addition, I filed a complaint through their online system (#04394910) on 9/15  and still haven't received a response.  I'm emailing the CEO Edward Bastion (edward.bastian@delta.com) today and will update this review if I ever get a response from anybody.  If not, I will continue to write about my experience on all the other travel websites I am a member on, and will contact the Atlanta BBB."
Date of travel: November 2021,20,Rearranging your seats,"Booked a flight over 8 months in advance. First class. First row, first two seats for my spouse and I.They changed the class and moved our seats around without notifying us. They rearranged other couples as well. We had to talk to other passengers around us, inconveniencing them, to be able to sit together. 6 flights (to and from destination total) and only 1 did we get to stay seated together."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Storm at jfk leads to stop in Boston,"Attendants were so very rude the whole flight.  Not a nice way to fly for 10 hours. The flight being diverted and missing my connection and then losing my bag to the wrong airport wasn’t even the problem, things like this happen, the rudeness of the attendants for 10 hours.... terrible!"
Date of travel: November 2021,20,Their late departure makes for missed contection,"Return from attending convention in Wichita. Departing flight was 25 minutes late and resulted in missed connection in Atlanta to Columbus, OH. No we're sorry, just your on standby for our next flight in 3 hours , 5 concourses away ! American Airlines got us to Wichita for $100 less and we were early on arrival.I feel once your in Delta's control in Atlanta you are at their mercy, not that that they show you any."
Date of travel: November 2021,20,Poor cabin service flying NY to LHR,"The Delta check-in staff were helpful and quick at JFK airport. But the cabin staff were not particularly friendly, brisk almost to the point of rudeness and keen to throw the meals at you and get away from the passengers as soon as they could.By contrast, the cabin crew on the outwards flight in Virgin Atlantic were very different - smiling, friendly, pro-active. I wouldn’t fly Delta again if I had a choice."
Date of travel: November 2021,20,Loooong 6.5 hours,"The in flight entertainment did not work the whole flight, and with kids it was tough.They did not offer food for purchase, and on a 6.5 hr flight we got got 2 drinks and 2 cracker/cookie bags.Not a great experience."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Delta made my fathers death so f’ing stressful,"Delta has made my fathers death one of the most complicated and confusing times more so than it already is. From changing prices for flights, making the bereavement flight very difficult, having me on hold for seven hours total trying to charge me for a flight fees that they broadcast as being waived during bereavement flights. Your desk agent in Buffalo is responsible for me missing my very first flight and is responsible for my sisters finding out that their father is dead without me being there. They kept me in line so long that the doors to my flight closed all because the agent was incompetent and took 30+ minutes/ the help of two others in order to change the boarding pass printer paper on one machine instead of moving to another machine and taking care of his guests. I want to be clear, it was NOT busy and he kept taking breaks to talk to his coworker. So I missed my flight and was charged to have it changed and even had to take a connecting flight at jfk( which I fell while trying to make it in time making my trip even worse) because I have three spinal issues and can not move around as easily. I even told delta this and they told me that it didn’t count as one of their disabilities and handed me the paper to call to change my flight. The guy was so freaking rude.  During the time waiting for my first flight , standing in the line so long caused my disc to slip out of place and I had been in excruciating pain the entire time of my initial journey. Once again I reached out to try and get the service for disabled people as I saw them escorting other disabled people to their gates in chairs to help them protect themselves against further injury. Yet, once again I was denied. (I have three spinal disorders that prevent me for standing or sitting for too long without pain. Hence why I made the request so many times) And don’t get me started on how crappy your phone systems are. You made coordinating flights for my grandparents a NIGHTMARE . Between myself and my parents we had to have spent $3000 on flights with you guys over the last week and a half and Jesus Christ if I could go back in time get a refund and go to another airline I would because this was the WORST experience I ever had while flying. I have to fly back and forth to atl over the next two months and based on this experience and the experiences of my grandparents who also flew with you this week…im most likely gonna find an airline that is true to their word and prioritizes the health and safety of their disabled and grieving passengers. If you have any further questions feel free to contact me as I STILL didn’t get the call back from the customer service supervisor that I was promised days ago after I waited on hold for 50 minutes. Dejon.gregory@icloud.com. I WILL continue to share my experience until I hear from you people. I will not be ignored."
Date of travel: November 2021,50,Excellent Flight,"Good boarding, on time departure, got in 30 minutes early.  Fine service in flight.  Like the LIVE TV at the seat.  The Delta Clubs were great... modern and spacious.  The new club in FLL terminal is a great addition."

Date of travel: November 2021,10,Beyond Upset,Delta’s Employees at the Atlanta airport are a wast of oxygen the amount of disrespect the Gate attendant gave after our flight was late due to deicing the gate attended them tells us that we’re late and it’s our fault we were 20 mins before gate closing and they straight up sold our tickets Fly any other company then these Oxygen wasters
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Issues with return flight,"Here's the problem I have. When I booked the flight I feel the price was fair for what I paid; a flight from Minneapolis to Istanbul with a stop in Amsterdam on the way there and a stop in Paris on the way back. 1 layover each way. We all know if a consumer changes their flight the airline will charge them. In this case they changed my flight on the way back to 2 stops with an additional stop in Atlanta adding 7 hours of flight and layover time to my travels.  I am aware of the issues with Covid. That is not the issue. My issue is they changed the return flight so close to travel that it would be impossible for me to reschedule back to a one-stop flight with that little time and Secondly, when they did this they offered no compensation in airline credit or a partial refund which they should have. If a consumer must pay to change a flight then an airline needs to compensate when they do not provide the service a  consumer paid for. i.e adding 7 hours of flight and layover time. When I booked the flight it was a fair deal. After they added the extra stop it was an over-priced flight which I was forced to use. The meals were also extremely sugary and salty and the seats were less comfortable  than American and SouthwestAlso, they tout how well they clean the planes and I found a rolled up napkin in my seat pocket and the bathroom air vent had like 5 months worth of dust on it."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Mother with a 4 year delta gave our seats away,"Gave our seats away prematurely, a seat with a mother and a 4 year old. Ended up being at airport till 2am with my child trying to figure this out. My flight was from São Paulo to Atlanta. Now I had to stay overnight in São Paulo, and our flight isn’t till 11pm the next day, With a trip to New York a 4 layover there and then to Atlanta. Worst experience I have ever had with delta! I need compensation for your company giving my paid seats for this flight to standby flyers who go to fly in my seat that I bought. No we were not late, departure time was 10:50pm we arrived at gate 10:30pm from connection flight."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Had to cancel flight,"First, my flight was delayed three times.  That put me behind schedule as it is.  However, I brought my two small dogs who were both correct size and weight.  Both were in separate carriers that were standard for air travel.  Arrive at the airport only to be told they won't accept them on the flight.  I spent days researching and planning for this flight, only to arrive (after my flight was delayed three times) and be told, ""sorry, you can't fly.""  Absolutely awful customer service, rude, demeaning, and would not work with me and my partner in the slightest.  Both of us were utterly shocked by our treatment.  Honestly, Delta, I used to sing your praises, but after today, seeing how you handled someone who isn't just a single traveler, I'm not coming back."
Date of travel: August 2021,30,A strange partnership with Air France,"It was a very bizarre experience to book my fight on Delta and be routed via Air France to Yerevan, Armenia.  Had I not wanted to change the return date, I would not have noticed that Delta does not have representation in Yerevan.  You have to go via Air France.  But when I went to their office in Yerevan, they didn't seem to have full access to my reservation details.   I was told their access to the Delta database was limited!!  Therefore, I couldn't conveniently change my flight without incurring unnecessary expenses and couldn't fly Comfort Economy which was my original booking.  It took me several trials and lots of wasted time on Delta Messenger, to finally find an agent who understood what I was saying to go ahead and change my return date.  I will never again make a booking on Delta to fly to Armenia."
Date of travel: November 2021,50,Great people,"My backpack would not fit overhead.  Sierra, a stewardess, let me put it in an empty seat, and let me move to another empty seat.  This was very kind, and I was so grateful on the tail end of an exhausting business trip.  Delta has great employees and I’m happy to have flown with them."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Honeslty the WORST travel experience I have had to date. SO MANY SCREW UPS,"I can't even begin to relay how frustrating and disappointing this entire weekend was because of how badly our travel plans were screwed up. This turned into the most stressful, costly, and time consuming travel interruption I have ever experienced in the 34 years I've been flying. Starting with our flight being cancelled while we waited at the airpot at our gate due to the ""internal server outage"" which caused us to have to scramble to book another flight that in order to make it to Albuquerque in time for a wedding that we were in. First we were offered zero help with finding alternative travel plans and left to choose between an hour and a half long line at the airport or a 3 hour hold time over the phone with Delta. No indication we would be refunded or accommodated in any way in the cancellation email. Just ""your flight is cancelled, sorry"". The one way tickets to ABQ cost us $270 each which is almost triple half of our roundtrip tickets that were under $200 total each. When I spoke to someone via Delta chat/text I asked for a refund to be processed for the cancelled portion of our flight but was VERY specific about the fact that we STILL NEEDED OUR RETURN FLIGHT from ABQ to LAX. When the agent came back hours later she said ""your refund is being processed in the amount of $196.80 each"" which is the full price of our round trip ticket. I said that can't be correct and asked if our return flight was still in place. Her response was that I asked for a refund which you can see in the attached screenshots was 100% NOT the case. She then said ""let me see if I can fix it"" and proceeded to NEVER COME BACK. This set into motion a huge chain of Delta agents repeatedly dropping the ball throughout my entire weekend while I spent over 8 hours trying to reach SOMEONE who could confirm that we still had a flight back to LAX. I got 4 or 5 different agents on chat, some of whom asked what I needed help with and then never responded to my immediate responses, some of whom I explained the whole scenario to who said the would look into it and also NEVER RETURNED. All indications via the Delta app and using our confirmation code online were that our flight was in place. It wasn't until I wait over 3 hours on hold on the phone while I was supposed to be spending time with friends and family I haven't seen in years that I got someone who informed me that my whole round trip flight was cancelled and that the agent I originally spoke to should have told me that it is not possible to cancel part of a round trip flight in the first place. I was then told that because I booked this trip through Chase I needed to contact them. I never spoke to Chase about cancelling the flights nor did the original agent EVER mention that I needed to contact Chase. Called Chase, waited on hold, they told me the whole round trip had been cancelled and my only option was to rebook at the current higher price which would have me pay THE SAME PRICE as my ENTIRE round trip just for our one way back to LAX. To which I told them absolutely not. I wait ANOTHER 2 hours on hold to FINALLY get a Delta agent on the phone who was the ONLY person in this process to actually be remotely helpful. She spoke to a couple people, ran into a dead end, and waited for an appropriate supervisor for over an hour while I sat on hold. She then was told that nothing could be reversed and again my only option was to book a new flight at double the cost and file a complaint afterward. This was all about an hour before we were supposed to be boarding our return flight almost leaving us stranded an additional night in ABQ with that added expense. I am also out a non-rufundable night stay of $132 for the Thursday night hotel we booked the night of 10/21/21. So all in all we are out an additional $900+ for extra ground transportation, cancelled hotels, cancelled rental car, and additional flight costs in order to make it to our destination and back. I am BEYOND appalled at how many times Delta service completely failed leaving us in a stressful lurch with no option but to spend hours of our weekend trying to reach customer service and dealing with people who did not help."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Triple charges,"I lost my youngest brother on Oct 22nd, 2021 in AZ and I had to fly with my older brother from MI to go and arrange for his funeral.I booked a flight with Delta, unfortunately I had a very bad experience. The website is terrible, no AM/ PM by the flights time, no seats to assign to, and not to mention the high prices of the flight tickets!The air fair tickets costed $1,337.68 round trip (regular class) for me and my brother on Saturday 30th, 2021 & returning on Sunday 31st, 2021 ( the very next day).Because of the missing am & pm for the travel time on your website, it coasted me additional $374 for switching the flight time from pm to am that wasn’t my fault.So I paid $1711.68 for one day just 24 h fight in this critical death situation.I am very disappointed, aggravated, and decided not to use Delta airlines again. The workers are mean, rude, and dishonest!This airlines nothing but a high way robbers.May"
Date of travel: September 2021,10,"I used to choose Delta Airlines always, until a horrific experience where a dog died!","A dog suffered and died while in the cabin of this flight. I am a Registered Nurse and I work in a large inner-city, level 1 trauma center. I have been working the frontlines against this COVID-19 nightmare since the beginning and our trip to Puerto Rico was planned to be a much-needed getaway. Some background on the situation: There were a pair of individuals that spoke minimal English. They had a French bulldog that they brought in a small carry-on container to keep underneath the seat. As we were boarding, one of the flight attendants told the male individual to open up the carrier so the dog could get some air, because the dog was panting very loudly and sounded like it was distressed. Thankfully, I was not aware of this background information or this situation would have been way more heartbreaking for me. About 2 1/2 hours into the direct flight, the flight attendants announced an overhead page asking if there were any medical personnel on board that could assist. A physician and I came to help and saw that the medical emergency was with this dog. We were told that ""we have a dog that is not responsive"". Between myself and the Spanish-speaking flight attendant, we were able to ascertain that the male individual noticed that the dog had not been moving in the carrier for the last 10-15 minutes and so he lifted the carrier up to check on the dog. The dog was not moving- no breathing, no heartbeat, the dog's eyes were stuck halfway open. The physician and I knew it did not look good. I asked for them to grab us some oxygen, and I ran back to my seat to grab a blanket I brought so that the two of us could lift the dog out of the carrier and onto the empty row of seats immediately in front of them. The dog was drenched in sweat. This is very alarming because dogs typically do not sweat. Also alarming- I immediately recognized that this was a bulldog breed and these breeds commonly have breathing problems that result in trouble cooling down. The male said that they had given a small sedative that they had first tried earlier in the week and had no concern with.Essentially, the physician and I did full-on CPR to the best of our ability, but the dog was deceased the moment we set eyes on it. The dog was only 1 year and 4 months old. This dog had no previous medical concerns. I pounded on that dog’s chest, desperately trying to get his heart pumping again. I turned the oxygen on full blast and held his airway open while trying to dry him off with my blanket.One of the worst parts of this experience is the memory of trying to fit the dog back into the carrier after we determined that we couldn't save him. THE DOG WOULDN'T FIT. We had to push his head down while someone else helped to zip the carrier up. Later at baggage claim, we saw the pet carrier stored underneath the female passenger's airport-provided wheelchair. There were bags on top of it. This dog was discarded like trash.I couldn't eat for the first 36 hours of this trip. I was having really bad stomach upset and panic attacks. I wanted to go home. I kept thinking of the terror that this dog went through during the first 2 hours of the flight and how completely terrified he must have felt. I have been acting as a surrogate family member for the past 16 months for my dying COVID-19 patients in the hospital, yet this is the experience that gives me nightmares. On the 5th day of the trip, I decided to look further into the Delta pet policy, and I was truly shocked when I found how clearly the policy states that bulldog breeds are considered “snub-nosed” breeds and therefore are not even permitted on the flight due to their breathing difficulties and inability to cool themselves down. This dog was so clearly a French bulldog that there was no way that it could have been argued otherwise. It made me more upset knowing that if only the protocol had been enforced, this could potentially have been avoided altogether. First and foremost, the responsibility for this dog’s negligent death lies at the hands of the owners. They should have known better, end of the story. However, the “second check” that happens by flight staff also failed. I am tormented by the thought that this could be occurring all over the world on board these flights. Delta Airlines: The high-quality service you provide is second to none. I am begging you, DO BETTER. Please!"
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Lack of basic customer service skills,Throughout the Delta terminals employees were on personal cell phone calls and acted inconvenienced when someone asked for help. I sat and watched for a long while and was very disappointed at the lack of professionalism. Where are the supervisors?
Date of travel: November 2021,50,SXM flight detail review,"I have previously reviewed but I forgot to add more information to my last review. We booked our flight from Roc to SXM in March 2021 for November 2021. A few times early after we booked, our flight information changed and we did have to make adjustments to our itinerary. This of course was frustrating in the moment, but you have to acknowledge that with COVID, staffing issues and other obstacles stuff like that is bound to happen. We had a really good experience adjusting our itinerary (yes extra work on our part) but delta was more than accommodating. We even ended up changing our return flight details a few days before and they were super helpful and we had no issues. Traveling can be stressful and while changes to plans you made far in advance are frustrating we acknowledged that delta did a nice job working with us and met us in the middle and the most important thing is great customer service and safety which I felt they did wonderful with both."
Date of travel: November 2021,50,SXM flight review,"We flew delta to ATL and SXM round trip. Our flights were smooth, clean, comfortable and accommodating. The crew was friendly and professional. Delta always makes me feel safe and I choose them over any airline! They were understanding of my flight anxiety and went out of their way to check on me. Love that they have the screens and WiFi messaging options too!"
Date of travel: November 2021,40,Delta my number 1,"Delta is one of my top airlines. They seem to have it all together when it comes to on time, cabin cleanness and staff friendliness. This not say I have not had some less than good flights with Delta. The trip took me from ROC to ATL to LAS. Tip, going through Atlanta can be confusing for first time travelers. My recommendation is to allow 2 hours for connections and that will reduce travel stress (works for experience travels too)This review is based on Delta's business (first) class."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Discouraging,"If you travel economy Delta ensures you will feel like a third class citizen by squeezing you into a very uncomfortable space. I don't recommend becoming a victim of Delta's quest for profit subjecting yourself to inhumane conditions for any length of flight. . Even if you are a small person you will feel uncomfortable in a very claustrophobic environment. If you can't book on another aircraft, try a different carrier."
Date of travel: November 2021,50,Delta 304 Honolulu to Atlanta,"Traveling 8 1/2 hours is a long time on a plane, but Delta 304 in Delta One was wonderful. The aircarft was extremley clean and well sanitized. The flat bed seats worked well. The service was excellent and the F&B was very good. The crew sure did make the 8 1/2 hour flight enjoyable,"
Date of travel: September 2021,50,Recommend!,"This was my first time booking a trip and renting a vehicle through Delta Vacations. The experience was great!! Delta Vacations made sure I had everything prepared for my journey. I felt even more comfortable using their vacation site since they use Affirm as their third-party loan provider (Affirm is known to be one of the better loan services). Everything went smoothly before and after. I can always count on Delta to provide an incredible experience and excellent customer service. Now that I am aware of Delta Vacations, I will be using them in the future and informing all of my friends and family!!"
Date of travel: October 2021,40,Minnesota weekend,My flight was from Raleigh to Minnesota with a layover in Detroit.  The staff was helpful and friendly throughout the trip.  Very smooth flight on each leg.  Glad to see that Delta is maintaining a high standard with the ongoing COVID issue on board the flights and in the lounges.  Delta is my go to airlines.My return flight was a straight through flight; however it was not quite as good due to the in-flight entertainment came with a price.  This is the first time I have encountered this issue.  I really hope Delta does not go to charging for in-flight entertainment.
Date of travel: October 2021,40,Great Flight,"Trip to northern Virginia.  Flight originated in Raleigh N.C., with a layover in LaGuardia N.Y.  The entire Delta crew was great! We were greeted with a Good Morning and a big smile, as we boarded the plane.  Thanks to our medallion status we were upgraded to 1st class, which is always a great thing.  Very good selection of in-flight entertainment. The return flight from DC went to Atlanta then to RDU.  We got the same welcome from the staff.  That is one of the things that makes Delta a great airline to fly with.  I would recommend this airlines to all travels."

Date of travel: October 2021,20,Nine Hours of Hell,"On October 17th 2021, I was returning home to Seattle from San Jose on Delta flight DL3768 at 7:30pm.  After we boarded the plane and sat in the cabin for a few minutes, the pilot informed us of a 15-20 minute take-off delay.  Not a big deal.  There was a thunderstorm in Tacoma, and SEATAC had slowed the number of landings they would accept.  This seemed fine to me and completely reasonable.About 20 minutes later, the pilot let us know the wait was now 45 minutes.  Real nice, but also not Delta’s fault.  Around 8:30, she came back on the intercom one last time to tell us the delay was now two hours.  It was then she announced we were going to unload the plane and they would let us mill about the airport until it was time to leave.A handful of us had a sorely needed margarita at the Mexican bar that was right next to our gate, but the kitchen was closed.  Having had no dinner, I wandered farther down the terminal in search of protein.  This was around 9:05.After a small and mediocre sandwich, I came back to the gate to find it completely empty - no passengers, no staff, and even the monitors were dark.  It was around 9:30 now, and I’d only been out of earshot for about 25 minutes before returning to this Twilight Zone episode.I couldn’t find my flight on any of the arrival or departure screens, and there were no Delta employees in sight.  In fact, the entire airport seemed suddenly abandoned.  At 10pm, I finally found someone who worked at Delta who was manning a gate where a flight had just arrived.  After a brief verbal exchange that sounded like a “Who’s On First” routine about where I had come from and what I was asking about, she was finally able to pull up the information on my missing airplane.They took off without me.  My flight had left a half an hour ago.  There was no airport-wide announcement that the flight was boarding (and I was listening to a paranoid degree).  They didn’t call my name or look for missing passengers, and they left an entire hour before they said they were going to.This part was Delta’s fault.  More than that, it felt almost personal.  I know how long it takes to board a plane, and the answer is not 25 minutes.  I’m trying to imagine the mad scramble it must have taken to get the plane fully boarded and off the ground while my back was turned, like an episode of Punk’d or Jackass.  I must have just missed them when I returned to the gate.  Just to twist the knife a little harder, they took my luggage – the roller bag they forced me to check because they overbooked the flight – to Seattle without me.I assumed the woman that was helping me would put me on the next flight out, and she did – for 7am.  Say what now?  How can there not be any flights for the next 9 hours?  I wasn’t offered any accommodations or reimbursements despite the fact that it was Delta’s fault I was stranded.  After doing the math, I realized I would only get four or five hours of sleep if I left the airport and came back, so I stayed there.  After 11, the terminal became an absolute ghost town.  Even the shops shut down.  I stayed there all night with the fluorescent lights, the stupid saxophone music on loop, no humans, no food, no sleep, and no water (since I wasn’t about the try the public fountain during a pandemic).When I finally arrived at Seattle-Tacoma, I almost left without my bag.  The person who was helping me couldn’t find it anywhere, despite the fact that it was a very distinct lime green.  She checked and double-checked before finally opening a ticket and saying they would get back to me.  I figured they had just completely lost it as the one final insult of this trip, and moped out of the office.Incidentally, I found it myself.  I spotted the green hard-shell in the one and only one luggage cage she hadn’t checked.  Apparently no one is supposed to use that crate because the lock is broken.  Lovely.This was quite possibly the worst travel experience of my life, but at least I got an entertaining story out of it."
Date of travel: October 2021,30,Not so great,"I would like to start by saying that I have flown enough to know that airlines, both domestic and foreign, like to change things on passengers, but I have never had one do so until Delta Airlines. Now Delta is a good U.S. carrier with good customer service. But for this flight they changed the time of the flight, they type of aircraft (to a smaller plane), our seat assignments and the meal from a box dinner with just snacks, to just one snack. Not a good start to the trip, though the crew was great."

Date of travel: November 2021,10,Delta Has Gone to the Dogs,My last flight with Delta was a nightmare but I decided to give some slack. After this debacle I can't ignore their ineptitude in provided some quality. 1st we bought full price 1st class tickets for our dream trip and about 2 weeks out discovered they had changed our return flight to a time that we could not make due to coming from a different island. They did after holding on the phone for an hour refund that portion of the ticket and we repurchased on Hawaiian Airlines. So we get to the airport in plenty of time to find out that our seats have been separated due to Delta changing planes. Once again no communication. Don't even get me started on boarding. Passengers with small children does not include children old enough to have their own roll aboard. Another reason I paid for 1st class was a dreamy thought of us celebrating take off with a glass of champagne. The flight attendants did nothing to acknowledge we were even on the plane. I live in Atlanta so Delta has always been my 1st choice keeping my Medallion level. After these last flights I will change my future flights forever to any other airline I can.

Date of travel: November 2021,10,What happened to the humans?,"I am very easy going and rarely complain. I was one of the last people checking into the flight (due to trying to get through some work before departure after back to back meetings) and they said that I need to check the bag. I politely asked if they can have another look if they can accommodate it in the cabin as I am flying every few days for business and waiting for a bag is really inconvenient. They said that I should check with  the cabin crew. I did the same and gentleman on this flight (DL3643 departing at 17:44 SFO to LAX-the only male within the cabin crew),  like a robot responded that I need to check it. I said please, could you have a look as I have been jet lagged for weeks traveling for business and this is really inconvenient. He said that this is a small national flight and didn’t bother even looking, didn’t care to hear more from me. So I checked my bag and honestly you could fit at least 5 carry-ons on this flight. I understand that there are rules but this is just zero carrying and customer service. I am traveling for 2 months for work with a carry on and a back back just so I don’t have to check a bag and spend time on waiting for it. In general Delta is mediocre airline, not amazing or bad, but I will not book it after this experience. And I just really hope that someone from Delta will have a talk and a gentle reminder with this staff member that they are still in the industry that exists to cater to people.."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Buyer beware,Delta airlines great except agents in the DR barely speak English.  As for Delta Vacations....run for your life.  A huge rip off.  And they will NOT help you should your hotel not be to your satisfaction.
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Worst experience I've ever spent $1000s on,"Delta is trash. Shameful.Literally a sickening experience doing business with Delta. These unscrupulous, INCOMPETENT degenerates will ""inconvenience"" you til you're traumatized to squeeze the profits and are so enthusiastic about denying culpability for their INCOMPETENCE that it never dawn's on them to seek a solution! On their overbooked flight, they insisted on checking my carry on despite my protests, then bumped us because they were at weight capacity. They claimed my companion was late, then allowed me 5 minutes to let me off when it would have taken 30 seconds to let him on. One of their Toadies let it slip that they were at weight capacity, ironically, while he was making excuses for not helping me.Our plans after that depended completely on where and how we could get our stuff back. We were informed it would be waiting for us in New Orleans. There were normal flights to New Orleans but we did manage to arrive the next day, filthy and exhausted. These people have every means of getting in touch with their passengers. EVERY MEANS! Nobody did.Nobody apologized. Nobody accepted accountability. Nobody managed to simply send me my bag! Nobody even called me back, gave me a case number, or otherwise followed their own protocol.FOUR DAYS I struggled on hold, getting disconnected, getting treated like trash, to get my luggage (which had my MEDICATION) before flying home just for that purpose only to find 5 lazy toads sitting around looking bored and annoyed to lift their heavy derriere of their chairs and retrieve my bag. Thousands of dollars to be tortured in a different state with nothing but the airport polluted clothes on my back, on hold with clueless, apathetic luggage department. Shame on you Delta. I'm amazed you manage not to crash."
Date of travel: October 2021,50,Hysterically Funny Pilot,"Our pilot was sooo funny during the usual pre-take-off pilot announcements. A real comedian. Our flight attendant, Stacey, handed out printed cards to several folks (us included) to thank people for choosing to return to flying & choosing Delta to do so. Nice touch. Flight was perfectly fine, we paid extra for premium economy (we both have long legs) & it was worth every penny."
Date of travel: October 2021,50,One Person can make a difference,"I just wanted to thank a Delta employee at DTW.  Her name is Susan.  I use to be a frequent flyer many years ago.  Susan seen an older couple confused and decided to shephard us through the kiask(check bag etc and ushered us through security, This allowed us to stay on schedule and catch our flight on our trip to HA via SEA on 10/19/21 in the evening.  That three mins made me feel like a FF again and relieved us of alot of anxiety.  We talked about that kind act throughout our vaction. We wanted to publicly say thank you one more time and God Bless you."
Date of travel: November 2021,10,Absolutley not,"Mobday morning, 45 min flight from Detroit to Columbus.. we've been boarded, sitting at the gate, for 2 hours. We've received an update every 30 minutes that we should be ""ready to rock and roll very shortly"". There was ""some liquid on the left side of the plane that maintenance is going to check out and send us on our way"". Not really sure where to begin with this, whether it be the vagueness or how infrequent the updates have been. Starting to wonder if this thing is going to take off at all."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Bad ticket policy,I changed the date of my return flight from UVF to ATL. I PAID for a first class upgrade after being encouraged to do so by the Delta app.  They then took the upgrade away and would not refund the money just because I changed the date saying the PAID FOR upgrade was non-transferable.  There were 2 first class seats open and available on the flight-terrible policy
Date of travel: October 2021,50,Great Experience,Both flights left exactly on time and landed 30 minutes early.  Staff at JFK gets you through the check in process very quickly. Delta Clear is worth it.  Have it for years.  Travel Delta frequently because they make it easy.

Date of travel: October 2021,10,Baggage clowns at Delta,"The clowns that Delta has that inspect luggage decided to leave my one pocket of my duffel bag suitcase open and I ended up losing the charger to my Water pic, charging device for Bluetooth headphones, and worst thing they either threw out my herbal meds which I need desperately.  I am in quarantine for 7 days on a cruise ship on Holland America where i work with the BB King band. So i cant replace my meds for like 3 weeks. I may end up losing my job or going back into quarantine again for 7 days if I have to leave to get them. Hopefully we will be back in the states next week.This is unacceptable on Deltas part and if I lose my job because of this I will be seeking legal assistance and a lawsuit against them for my earnings and everything I will now have to go through without my meds."
Date of travel: October 2021,40,Very good,"This is a very good airline, only problem, TV touch sensors. half the time my tv doesn’t do anything when I press a button. Otherwise, great airline"
Date of travel: October 2021,30,Very Disappointed,"Things didn't start well as our flight was 20 minutes late taking off. We had only 40 minutes to make our connection in Detroit which could still have been doable. However, no effort was made to get passengers seated quickly. Then the pilot said we had to redistribute the load so that took some time. No effort was made to speed up the flight. When we got to Detroit the ground handlers were slow to come out and that meant we missed the connection. We found out that there were at least four connections missed by passengers on that flight. Delta did give us a hotel room in Detroit but all we had was the stuff in my backpack. Our new flight moved us from Comfort +  to Coach and crummy coach seats at that. We upgraded to first class to avoid those seats at a cost of $650. On the way home Delta lost my wife's suitcase. The Harrisburg airport screwed up the paperwork for the lost luggage so I had to do that the next day.  Then the Harrisburg personnel forget to give the information to the transporter until I called again. We got the suitcase 24 hours after our plane arrived. Also, we had our name tag with address and phone number on the bag which didn't seem to mean anything to anyone.  We flew Delta because we have had problems with American.  It turns out Delta wasn't any better."
Date of travel: October 2021,20,3 Failings,"Delta fell short in at least 3 ways yesterday (1) Attendants failed to remind passengers to properly wear their masks during the flight, even for a passenger on the isle clearly not wearing his all.  (2) It was a bad day with mechanical, weather, and crew induced delays. Bad days can happen to any airline. I fault Delta for their very poor communication to the throngs of people stuck in the terminal. (3) Their sustainability plan is nothing but smoke and mirrors. It contains absolutely no commitments. A critical read revealed an empty plan and a company that is not doing anything substantive in this important area."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Don't fly Delta if you want to stay healthy!,"I fly Delta often but after this trip I will not book with them again. They did not enforce their Covid policies. The flight was overbooked and we were herded in like cattle. No social distancing, no mask enforcement. There was a very sick child on the plane--old enough to wear a mask but the parents did not keep a mask on the child while he coughed up a lung on all of us. We spoke to the flight attendant who refused to enforce the policy. Then the food service came though and we requested a single serving water bottle to keep the cough germs from falling into our cups --but the flight attendant refused - claiming that she did not have any bottles of water.  This was a lie because we saw them being used in first class just a few rows up. Lastly this same lying flight attendant would not let anyone stow their bags above their seats. As people boarded she insisted they take the first available bin. What?! This resulted in all the bins at the front of the plane being full as people entered--so the rest of the passengers had to then go to the back of the plane to store them and then go against the current to get back to their seats. People got stuck in the back storing their bags and couldn't get back to their seats. I have never seen such a chaotic boarding situation! Most of this was due to one incompetent flight attendant but the airlines is responsible for training these people better. No more Delta for this world traveler."
Date of travel: October 2021,50,First time a charm,"I am a long time member of American Advantage but found the schedules offered by Delta for this flight much more convenient. My first flight was to Minneapolis and then boarded the same aircraft to Calgary but with a different crew.The first leg (3hours) I was seated in 1D. Many reviewers had complained about the lack of legroom and I have to agree. However, it was easy to get in and out and there was no one reclining in to my space. The crew on this flight was exceptional. The next leg (over 2 hours) I was in 2D. This time the legroom was great but I was not happy when the customer in front reclined. The service for this leg was also good but not quite up to the standard of the first. The aircraft (an A319) was immaculate despite its age with a modern interior and huge overhead bins. Each passenger has their own entertainment screen with a large assortment of options but I found the music selections disappointing. Meals were served in a box (due to Covid) but tasty and well presented. Overall I enjoyed my first experience with Delta and not a whole lot to complain about!"
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Don’t book with Delta Vacations you will regret it!,Buyer BEWARE!!!!! Worst experience I have ever had with a vacation company Delta Vacation is the worst. Cancel my family flight a week before leaving and then tried to hold us hostage in Atlanta for two nights to get back home or I could cancel. Really a week before and didn’t show any remorse besides a insincere apology. Customer service sucks be prepare to be on hold for 4 hours will they apologize for ruining your family vacation.
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Worst experience ever!,"Today was the worst experience I have ever had. We check into the sky priority ticket desk. My family came in really early because we had a new born (3 months) and were looking to access the delta sky lounge to feed our new born. While checking in, there was an issue printing out my baby’s ticket. We waited over an hour while my baby was crying and freaking out. As parents it hurts, knowing that I’m not able to give my son  his nutrients. Dawn at the front desk kept on brushing us off. I asked her to call the supervisor but she refused. After the tenth time, she went to the back. After 45 minutes Heidi shows up. I had to explain the whole situation to her… again. All while my baby is freaking out because he’s hungry. Heidi and Dawn gave me an attitude and just seem like they wanted to get me out of their hair. They did not assure that my son will be on the flight home with me. They did not value my piece of mind or my time. Let me remind you that it took over 45 minutes to speak to a supervisor. This is the most unprofessional experience I’ve dealt with. This is not what I had in mind when I booked first class tickets. Please reach out to my so I can further address this situation."
Date of travel: October 2021,50,Really nice experience,"Overall flight was great! With the pandemic still ongoing and now it’s also flu season too I was happy the flight was not too packed and I actually got my own row. I am not sure why the female stewardess wore pink dresses, but they were really cute and the staff overall were great. The boarding process was straightforward. It was a short flight, landed early and not to turbulence. Once again, I wish the headphones could accommodate a different plug (iPhone inlet) or I could watch movies on my iPad or phone. We can charge our iphones but can’t use the usb or outlet to watch movies so that is horrible. The pilots were great and I’m truly grateful for a safe flight!"
Date of travel: October 2021,30,"Nice flight, still covid concerns","Overall flight was ok, but still very weary due to packed plane while the pandemic is still ongoing and now it’s also flu season too. It was a short flight, landed early and not too much turbulence. I still wish the headphones could accommodate a different plug (iPhone inlet) or I could watch movies on my iPad or phone. Staff were nice and snacks were ok."

Date of travel: September 2021,10,Unsafe COVID Protocol,"Refusing to require staff to be vaccinated poses extra risks for all onboard.  Moreover, it encourages anti-vaxxers to fly this airline.  Kudos to United, American, Jetblue, Southwest and others for taking the right public precautions.  Hopefully, Delta follows suit, once they realize this is detrimental to their business."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Bag not found.,"Lost a bag. Concerns. That there is no investigation. If that bag is lost, this would be an issue. They are simply waiting for it to show up for 5 days, instead of investigating where it fell off the carriage, or who picked it up, since their record shows that it arrived. It seems like it was tucked somewhere and lost track of. I'd like them to find it, and call me that they have. As of now, I'm operating without all of those things, and incurring quite a bit of costs myself. And it will only get worse when I fly out to sites over the next few weeks. So waiting for a claim for 5 days to weeks isn't really a solution. Once it didn't show up for 5-6 hours after it was supposed to, it is/was, gone. Gone. Gone. Gone. As of THEN. Investigate. You guys have more than enough of whatever information you need through your tracking system to find it, go for it.Unless it has ascended into the final home after the rapture, it still exists here, in this plane. Find it please. If not, say so, ASAP, and reimburse, so that I can start recreating the hundreds(+) of hours its going to take me to try and replace all of that stuff.In the fairness. I also made mistakes. I should NOT have packed as much valuable stuff into that. It's so tempting when you're traveling for work, so that you can kind of keep home with you. That was a mistake."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,DO NOT fly Delta - Complete Ripoff,"We booked first-class tickets on our flight with Delta.  They canceled the flight and put us in economy on another flight and would not refund the difference.  They said it was booked through Expedia so we should call them.  Expedia rightly pointed out that Delta canceled the flight and was obligated to give us our money back or provide us with first class seats.  Neither happened and we flew economy after paying for first class.  I contacted them afterwards and they basically don't care.Ironically we finally made it on first class on our return flight and it was extremely underwhelming.  The seats are small and old and were very dirty (amazing during the times of covid).  At best it felt like flying premium economy.  Don't ever fly first class on Delta since it's not worth the money.  For that matter, just pick another airline.  Anyone who cares so little about their customers doesn't deserve to stay in business."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,"Canceled, and we don't care!","Had to fly, due to a funeral. Such as all funerals, are short notice. Booked the only flight available to make it to the funeral on time. Arrived for my flight at 4:45 a.m. Realized my flight had been cancelled and rescheduled for the NEXT MORNING. I was told I was out of luck. Even after explaining it was a funeral, they made no efforts in getting me routed to North Dakota to make it in time for my uncle's funeral. Delta- you really suck!"
Date of travel: October 2021,10,DON'T EVER FLY DELTA!,"Delta delayed and 3 hours later cancelled my flight.  They couldn't rebook me for more that 48 hours and then only to a city 3 hours away where I would have to rent a can at my expense and drive.  I was going to a triathalon and would arrive after it finished.  They would not refund my ticket but told me to rebook with another airlines - which cost me $1200!  I paid for 2 days of hotel and rental car as well which was more money thrown away.  I have been on hold on the Delta 800 # for 4 hours - nothing but Music and ads - no real person.  I fly a lot but I will not fly Delta again.  To say they don't care is a huge understatement.  They are less than worthless and even when they cancel, you can't get a penny refunded."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,DESPICABLE AIRLINE,So I booked my full fare first class round trip ticket from NYC to Las Vegas in July 2021 for departure in late October 2021. When I booked my ticket & chose my seat the entire first class cabin was available. One week before departure Delta emails me & says they've changed my return flight from a 7am departure to a 1pm departure...no explanation. I checked online & saw my original flight was still valid so I called Delta. After waiting on hold for 90 minutes I had the pleasure of speaking to very kind agent. She could not explain to me what happened to my original set (she was well trained) . End result I cancelled my RT ticket & will walk on my head before ever fling Delta again. I hope they go bankrupt! Disgusting amoral airline.
Date of travel: November 2020,50,Good airline,Good airline. They gave delta biscoff.Nice seats. Parked plane close to exit.There was a lot of legroom.
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Covid Safety is Poor,"Flew from SLC to Seattle last week - it was like being in Marti Gras on this flight - half way through the flight they served drinks and snacks - at which time everyone took that as a signal to take off their masks and start chatting it up. At no time did anyone on the staff try to enforce mask wearing and it was very awkward from that point in the flight onward. I am 100% fine with folks not wearing masks in non-confined spaces - but on an airplane, in that small space - come on Delta - get your act together and if you have a policy - enforce it and quit putting folks at risk like we were on that flight - super uncomfortable and wont be back anytime soon."
Date of travel: October 2021,20,Wish they cared like they did 30 years ago.,"You can't blame this on covid.  Before Covid began,  Delta had dropped its customer service to minimal - at best.Flights that used to serve meals on real plates in coach,now had packaged junk even when we flew first class.Recent comfot+ to Belize was in crowded seat, minimal snack and had to pay to check 1 bag per flyer.Really?  Can't even check one small bag when flying comfort.Guess what - now we arrange our schedule to use other airlines if at all possible.  Why pay Delta rates with bargain basement cut-rate service."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Delta Airlines Customer Service IS Non-Existent,"Delta used to be an excellent choice to fly. Not anymore.  They have raised prices, lowered service and have made contacting them impossible.  Delta has always been notorious for schedule changes, but customer service was always easy to contact and get help.  Now this ridiculous messaging system they have is useless... I messaged them about changes they made to our flight schedules... I had to wait 1 1/2 hours to be informed I had to contact a schedule change specialist.  I called and was informed my wait would be 4 hours."
Date of travel: September 2021,20,Dissatified customer poor service,I had booked to fly with delta through edreams from Toronto to NY on a direct flight. Two weeks after booking the airline unilaterally changed my flight for the same day 1.30 hour earlier and instead of direct to go through Michigan and intransit for 5 hours before connecting to NY.The airline unilaterally change the itinerary without prior notifying me of the change or seeking my approval. While they offered that I had the options to cancel for credits  i was not consulted with regards to a suitable alternate that would take me direct.Trying to get a delta representative on the phone required a 2 hour wait time and was hung up on.I would never travel with Delta ever again. In my opinion Delta is of the most worst and most unprofessional  business I have encountered in my travel experience. Would never recommend them to anyone.The booking agency edreams was no help also but did offer a 40$ discount on future bookings.
Date of travel: October 2021,50,Delta v American  ..  No Contest,"My Wife and I just completed a “Bucket List” 49th Anniversary Viking River Cruise Trip that was exceptional!  We were originally scheduled to fly British Airways to Budapest however that was changed to an American flight and then finally to a Delta flight. I was happy in that a number of Friends have told me how nice Delta is v. American. I have not flown Delta in a number of years opting for American because we were primarily flying out of AA Hubs in Philadelphia and Orlando. Boy were they right!  From Baggage Check in to Friendliness to Cleanliness and Flight Attendant Attitude, Delta wins hands down.  We were flying First Class so there was access to the Delta Club in both Orlando and Atlanta as well as the KLM Club in Amsterdam.  They were clean / airy, the Reception was extremely friendly, the choices of food and beverages was very good, windows clean and seating comfortable. Check In was a breeze and the cubical seating was clean and comfortable with lots of at seat storage space.  The seats were highly adjustable.  We were on an Airbus 380 series.  There was a mechanical issue with our flight from Atlanta to Amsterdam which caused a 1 ½ hour delay in departure.  Someone had flushed a toy on the previous flight that was stuck in a critical valve for offloading the toilet waste.  This was discovered after everyone was on board and the decision made to remain boarded rather than deplane.  The captain kept everyone informed of their progress in the remediation with factual information sprinkled with a little humor.  The flight attendants made everyone on the plane as comfortable as possible. When underway, the cabin service was great, the food upscale restaurant quality and the entertainment selections were current.  I cannot sleep on planes so I was able to notice the flight attendants were checking on everyone every 15 minutes.  They also attended to the toilets every 30 minutes.  The wake – up process was “gentle” and well executed.  The entertainment headsets were left at our seats on deplaning. The delay meant we had missed our connection in Amsterdam however, after passing through the Immigration Check, when we arrived at the KLM Club, they had our tickets waiting (same seats same class) for us on the next flight to Budapest departing in 1 ½ hours.  Turned out to be a FUN flight as one of the flight attendants was on her last flight with KLM and moving on to a new career.  Everyone was celebrating her the entire flight. Older model 737 but clean and comfortable.  Offboarding and baggage claim were easy in Budapest.Flipside:Our return flight was on an American 780 series aircraft.  We were first in line to check in on an early morning flight with all documentation ready.  The person at the check in counter had obviously had a rough night and was not a happy individual.  That attitude continued when our boarding passes were printed and had split up my Wife and I on a 10+ hour flight from Amsterdam to Dallas.  The reasoning given was the captain had rights to one of our seats.  I’ve flown numerous international business / first  flights and never had that happen.  The check in person was borderline rude stating that was the policy and we could change to the last row (next to a galley and restroom) or stay in the current separated seats.  We went for the last row so we could be together.  It turned out to be a good move in that the noise up front from meal preparation and utensils was very loud.  By the way, the captain never availed himself / herself to that seat the entire flight.  There was no priority loading and it was a free for all line up to board the plane.  No attention to Group Number at all.  The plane obviously had not been cleaned thoroughly from the previous flight and the overhead bins were dirty on the outside as well.  My seat had popcorn and other detritus from the previous flight in the side of the cushion. The food was the worst I have encountered on an International flight (that's 40 years).  My steak was dried out and very tough .. could not eat it.  My wife’s was the same.  For the flight attendants, it was as if it was a chore to provide service to passengers.  The attendants checked up on passengers at one-hour intervals with a walk by (but no attention to empty drinks or trash) unless someone used the call button.  The toilets were not serviced the entire flight.  180 degrees from Delta.  The Wake-Up process consisted of turning the cabin lights on full.  The flight attendants retrieved the entertainment headsets 30 minutes prior to landing.  It was as if the passengers were going to steal them ..  not a good vibe.  On most domestic flights, the headsets are retrieved no more than 10 minutes prior to landing.Back on US soil, the Admiral’s Club in Dallas was very good.  Reception was friendly, seating areas clean, typical selection of food and the seats comfortable.  Our 737 to Orlando was clean and the flight attendant was very good.  American has always been a step below others on International Carriers but acceptable when garnering points.  With our experience on this International Flight, we will begin exploring Delta on Domestic Flights and opt for Delta over American on any International Flights from now on.I am an American Platinum Elite Pro Member and a member of the International Travel Writers and Photographers Alliance."
Date of travel: October 2021,50,Compliment,I recently traveled with my elderly parents and my mother needed wheelchair assistance before and after each flight. All of the employees who assisted were so kind to her and my father and I. They did not act like it was a burden or 'their job'. It made my heart very happy :)
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Very bad customer service at 1800-221-1212,Delta has canceled my flight scheduled on Nov25th. I have been trying to reschedule my flight since last 2-3 days and it has been a frustrating experience. There are long wait times on 1800-221-1212 and once connected they transfer you to a different department making you wait for more than an hour sometimes. I also tried the chat option provided at https://www.delta.com/us/en/need-help/overview. A few agents seemed unfit for that role or unprofessional as they were not able to even provide basic correct information. And in some cases the chat session just times out and I have to restart again with a new agent.
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Not a happy camper!!,"For our honeymoon we splurged on first class with delta. Thinking they were the best before we went and finding out they are the biggest Scam Ever!! I paid 6,000 dollars to sit in first class for 6 hrs and that’s it!!!!! I called to get some kind of refund and they offered me only $200 to use on my next flight. My husband is a truck driver and has a bad back and needed the first class so lay down since it’s a 12 hr. Flight!! I’m beyond sick about this. Do not book online bc they will say well it’s your fault you booked online!! Who calls to book anything anymore????"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Pathetic Customer Service,"It's pathetic how much money Delta spends on marketing yet has the worst customer service in the industry for its skymiles members! Following our trip, Delta call wait times exceeded 2+ hours and email messages promised a response in over 30 days! Needless to say, Delta never responded to our urgent petitions for help in resolving a major concern."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Terrible customer service,"We booked flights to Puerto Vallarta on 5-5-21 for travel on February 8-22, 2022.  We booked early and seats were all open, we booked comfort seats.  I noticed on 10-17-21 that they changed our flights for travel February 10-22, 2022.  I called in 10-17-21 and they told me that there was a flight change and the flight was canceled on February 8th.  I called back today 10-18-21 and they told me that the flight was still available but the comfort seats were sold out?? I asked how can that be when I booked our seats over 5 months ago and all the seats were available?? All they could do was move us to the main cabin??? So they just kicked us out of our seats that  I booked over 5 months ago and sold our seats to someone else??? TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!"
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Service compared to low cost flight not a trans Atlantic,They over charge me for my suitecase $275 then they requested to wraped. They made a lot of excuses because of covid
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Worst customer service ever,"It took so long to get a customer service person on the phone my call kept dropping at 2 hours. Over and over. A few days later I finally get someone via text, they help me cancel my and my boyfriends flight, they e credit us. We check that we received the ecredit, all good! Two weeks later? His still shows up but mine now says $0. They just took away over $200 of credit!? I’ve tried on the app, I’ve tried on my computer, nothing. And now I have to spend hours waiting, calling, texting to hopefully get it sorted. HOW IS THIS A PROFESSIONAL COMPANY!? I honestly will never fly them again after this. Especially not after all the time spent trying to contact them way ahead of our trip. It’s irresponsible. Zero loyalty to their customers."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Delta worker trying to scam the elderly,"I had a DL1908 flight departing JFK today (10/17/21). I was trying to get my boarding pass printed. A male Delta worker said they are no longer printing them. He offered to help me download the Delta app for $20. I said no, I can give him $10. He became upset and said he doesn't want to waste his ""f'n time"" helping me for $10. I retrieved my passport and said I no longer want his help. He tried to grab my passport out of my hand when I refused to work with him and requested to work with someone else. When I asked for his name, he flipped his name tag and refused to give me his name. Eventually, I found another Delta worker (I think it was his supervisor) who helped me get my boarding pass. This is unacceptable and unethical for workers to request additional funds to help passengers get on their flight. And for workers to be able to hide their name tags at their leisure. I did not know that Delta treats the elderly this way.https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729060-r814893062-Delta_Air_Lines-World.html#"

Date of travel: October 2021,10,DELTA AIMING FOR WORST AIRLINE AWARD,DL1 …. On a Business First ticket… Wasn’t assigned a seat … had to wait till everyone boarded … then given a seat in front of rest rooms… baggage lost… it’s been 2 days … Delta has no idea where our bags are… couldn’t care less either… so hard to even get any status update …. AWFUL FLYING EXPERIENCE - our entire vacation is messed up #HATEDELTA
Date of travel: October 2021,50,Thanks to Captian Reed!!!,We were booked to fly DL4337 yesterday. When we began to board there was some computer glitch with our ticket. We had had them printed at check-in and our seats were open and ready for us. The gate attendants worked for over 15 minutes to resolve while the rest of the passengers already loaded waited to take off. Finally Captain Reed came in and told the attendants to let us board and resolve the issue later. We were so happy to get on that plane.Not done yet... once in the air Captain Reed radioed ahead and made sure our tickets for the next two legs were reloaded. Then he sent that message to us via on the of the flight attendants.The rest of our trip went off without any more complications. Captain Reed took an bad situation and turned it around to make us a Delta fan!
Date of travel: October 2021,20,Rude before even getting on the plane,"If you want to fly the friendly skies, this is not the airline. Why would you want to get to an airport early, pack lightly, and then have an attendant berate you for not having your tiny purse inside of your carry-on, knowing full well that I was going to put it inside of my bag? No lessons learned here except that Delta needs to work on training attendants to be welcoming and friendly. Total power trip this guy was having."
Date of travel: October 2021,20,Used to be much better,"I've flown delta for years under the impression that they're a little nicer than other airlines but as of late that's just not true. Recently my family and I were flying to Bozeman MT to visit Yellowstone National Park. When I tried to book my tickets online there was some sort of issue with the website so I had to call delta, when I spoke to a delta representative they were able to book the flight but they put my wife and I on one reservation and my kids on a separate reservation. I was assured that this was essentially just a technicality and something that needed to happen to accommodate whatever issue was happening on Delta's side, but that it would not negatively impact my travel. The first issue came up when we tried to check in. We couldn't check my kids in online as they were 'unaccompanied minors'. They're not flying unaccompanied, but to Delta it looked that way, so I called Delta again, they said there was nothing I could do, but we would just have to check in at any of the counters at the airport. After arriving 2 hours early as instructed we found a delta employee, explained that we needed to check bags and check in unaccompanied minors. They directed us to a service counter where we waited about 30 minutes in line. Once it was our turn the person at this counter informed us that there's a special counter for unaccompanied minors and that we'd have to wait in another line. An hour and fifteen minutes later we finally had our boarding passes and made our way to security. We arrived 2 hours prior to departure and made it to our gate 15 minutes after our flight's scheduled departure time, the only reason we made the flight is that it was running an hour late. We had also paid extra to choose our own seats, since we were traveling with our kids we wanted to make sure we're all sitting together. On our return flight however they seemed to misplace our seat assignments and put us elsewhere not together, not the seats we had chosen and paid for. I've had good experiences with delta in the past, but this was not one. It also wasn't limited to one person or one airport or one counter, every step of the way we got bad information or had to wait longer than was acceptable or didn't get services we paid for. I'm not sure I'd write delta off completely as I think this probably just puts them on par with other airlines. But I can't in good conscience recommend them to anyone."
Date of travel: August 2021,50,Best airline so far,"Delta the best airline so far, ive been on american,continetal, and so far the best. Seats in first clasd were very comfy and very good fit for a plus size girl. I will defiently recommend this airline. Will be flying again in 2 weeks. Thank you delta."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Find another airline,"Delta used to be good. The flight attendants were good, but delta themselves are horrible. Spend too much money to get basic service. The held me hostage ar atl,  acting like I was privileged not very inconvenienced.  when I tried to contact anyone ahead of time. It was impossible.i waited 2 days on chT, still didn't get to anyone.  Never again, I may not be able to fly first class on another airline, but at least the don't screw me over and overcharge for basic service."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,What has happened to Delta?!?!?!,"I was impressed with Delta because of their response to Covid. That ended after my first flight—8 days into our 24 day trip, we had a medical emergency and needed to reschedule flights. I could not do this online. I tried to call Delta customer service numerous times and was placed on a two hour hold. There were two times that I actually had to wait out the two hours — it was so important that I talk to them. I burned through two  orange SIM cards doing this and at the END of the two hour wait—I was cut off the line. WHAT in the hell has happened to their customer service?!?!?! They no longer HAVE customer service. Before I knew this, I booked our Christmas flights. I am glad that I can cancel them without penalty because that’s exactly what I’m going to do. I am furious with Delta. It is such a shame. Not fair to their employees and certainly not to their customers ."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,They tried to make me pay triple for one ticket,"I tried to go through delta because they’re supposed to be the nice airline, but they only let me buy one ticket at a time with my skymiles card, and then they wouldn’t let me buy the second ticket for several days. On the exact day I was allowed to pay the price shot up to 1,400 from 560, and then when I tried to figure it out online the person said 1,900 is all they could do, which is just incorrect. Completely refused to help me, so the person I’m flying with is going to start their trip late so we don’t have to pay an extra 1,300 dollars.. kind of insanely bad service."
Date of travel: September 2021,50,GREAT experience flying from Atlanta to Bogota Colombia,"I travel with Delta on my Trip to Bogota, Had a Great experience, on-time departure, and on-time arrival. nothing but good things to say about Delta. Great prices Friendly Customer service."
Date of travel: August 2021,50,Best Airline to travel when to get to your destination is a Must.,"I was traveling from Atlanta to Cancun, my  Fiance from Colombia to Cancun,  her arrival time was at 4: 30 pm same as mine, my fly was delay 1 hr, so I did get there just 1 hr late which wasn't that bad, but I imagine if my flights were canceled? like some other Airlines do? that could end up a mess.  this is the first time Delta Delay a fly on me. OF COURSE, THE WAYBACK WAS JUST FINE AND ON TIME."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Lost  my luggage!!!Refunded me a small portion,"I flew with Delta - my first and last time ever - in September 2021. I arrived to JFK Queens NY and both of my check-in luggage were missing. Eventually, one arrived a few days later (I have no idea how it ended up in London) and the other one is lost or stolen, God knows. Its now October 14 and Delta decided to give me $380 ONLY. It had clothes gifts shoes handbags worth more than this. Never again. My friend even told me you should've never  flown with Delta, they're known to lose bags. Should have listened :("
Date of travel: September 2021,30,Nothing special but satisfactory,"The flight was as expected but they no longer provide food service so bring your own. Masks required as expected. There was quite a bit of chaotic interaction with the gate attendants over the travel restrictions, documentation they wanted to see before boarding international flights.  IN YYZ, on clears, enters the USA at the airport so I do not know why Delta would be required to see the proof after clearing Customs and Immigration.   Return, over heard one delta gate agent asking the purpose of their travel (to Canada) REALLY, they are customs agents now too?  Guess the blame lies with the governments making the airlines their scape goats, but Delta please do not over reach.   On the positive, seems like there were a lot, lot less of those special people making demands, ignoring basic instructions.  YA for that!"
Date of travel: October 2021,50,Phenomenal,"This was not only my first time flying with Delta but my first time ever flying period and I must say I enjoyed every bit of it. From the early arrival, to the tv, to the roomy seats.  Not to mention being able to sit with my kids. Everyone was nice and courteous especially the flight attendant Sarah. From now on out I won’t fly with any other airline and I recommend you do the same."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Same same same,"Here's the issue I have with Delta. it's not inside their airplanes with comfort or service. it's what happens before. Basically, we all know Delta isn't the cheapest.  Here's what rubs me the wrong way. They always overbook so pre-flight is like an auction trying to get 5-10 people to give up their seats for credits  every time. Then if you don't fly with them all the time for business, you are like group 6 so they make you feel like a peasant.  Lastly, you book a flight with them that you though was a decent value and of course they change it and add time and  a 2nd stop so you should have just bought a skiplagged ticket in the first place and saved a bunch of money. Happened a couple times on international.  The pre-auction trying to clear up seats from over-booking happens every flight."
Date of travel: October 2021,50,Overall a GREAT airline!,"No airline is perfect, but being a long time flyer on both American, United, and recently Delta - Delta wins hands down.  I have over 2 million miles on American and United and yet I still prefer Delta.  Delta actually cares about their passengers, and really tries to help when things go wrong (as they always do).  For the people who are complaining about Delta's service clearly they haven't looked at the competition."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Two flights. One connection for each. None of them were without delays.,"Flew into Pittsburg on Friday. Had two delays on the first flight. Had two delays on the second flight, not to mention several gate changes causing us to bounce all over the ATL airport. Took us all day to fly into Pittsburg. We were too late to check in our hotel. Lost that $200. But, we made it for the funeral on 5 hours of sleep. That’s okay. We scheduled a 7 am flight for the following morning. Assuming we could rest when we get home. We boardedOur flight at 710 am. It’s now 930 am. We’ve missed out connecting flight. All the flights are sold out from ATL to PNS and MOB. There are no rentals left in ATL bc so many other flights are messed up. Profits over people couldn’t be more obvious this weekend."
Date of travel: October 2021,20,Customer Service Guity of Profiling,"Spoke with this guy called David and as soon as he heard my accent he started to talk like someone who doesnt care. I had my mother inlaw in a flight from Nigeria to Houston via Atlanta and I realized she was not in the original flight from Atl to Hou. I called to confirm if what i was seeing on the app is correct which indicated that her bags are on the original flight but she missed the flight. This is a woman coming to US for the first time in addition to the fact that she can't speak English. David's initial attitude was that he can't confirm anything for me and later asked for passenger information which I provided to him, to my surprise he checked the info and told me he still can't tell me anything. So you mean you will hold back on my relatives information after confirming the passengers info? This is pathetic. My pregnant wife had been crying since she heard my conversation with David. I just hope everything is fine with the old woman because there is no help from Delts airline at this time."
Date of travel: October 2021,20,Terrible inflight entertainment,the inflight entertainment was horrible; TV screens for all 4 seats in our row froze so many times and wouldn't respond to touch. It seems to recycle some kind of internal setting. Such a bad experience. I hope my flight home is better. The only best thing was the phenomenal touch down!! WOOOOOOOW! SOOOOO SMOOTH. FLIGHT 347 PILOT WAS DA BOMB!!
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Customer Service is Terrible,"Delta is a joke.  If you need to contact them for any purpose, be prepared to be on hold for a minimum of 2 hrs, most likely longer. Their website is not updated, information on their website is incorrect. We will never be flying with them again."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Rude delta staff,After my flight was delayed I would miss my connecting flight to get home so delta employees helped me get a hotel room they were very attentive. Unfortunately my group of 3 had first class tickets and we had to be downgraded to get the next flight out in the am. So we arrived at the airport to our gate and the tv showed there was 7 upgrades available so I walked up to the kiosk for assistance. I stood for over 15min with no acknowledgement. She would walk away and come back to check a few flight attendants but still didn’t acknowledge me so I said excuse me 3 times before she responded with sir I’m kinda busy as you can see. I told her it doesn’t hurt to acknowledge that someone is waiting and let us know it could be a few min. She then made me wait for another 5 min as she sat in-front of me then with an attitude asked what can she help me with. I asked about the upgrades and she told me none was available even tho I could clearly see some was available. So after that brief conversation I went back to wait for boarding the flight and could see the upgraded seats being taken one by one. I was so furious but I kept my cool cause she was very rude and I was worried if I said something she may not let me on the flight. I will never use delta for business or pleasure travel again.
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Delay after Delay with no Answers or Service,"I am probably going to die in the Atlanta Airport waiting for Delta to hire enough staff to fly the plane out to Orlando.  There are so many planes on the ground and very few employees and flight crew.  I have been waiting almost 24 hours to make a 90 minute flight.  I could have driven there, back, and there again.  Never fly Delta again!!!"

Date of travel: October 2021,10,Worst experience,"One delay I understand.. but 6!? Pardon my French but are you freaking kidding me!? NO ONE knew what was going on. And honestly if there was no staff in the FIRST place then why book the flight on this set day?? For my wife and I we are on the luckier side, we're just coming home. But for others it's a different story. Planned vacations, money down the drain. And some kids.. the last delay was close to 11 o'clock at night! And it's not like they threw us all in a hotel or apologized. No refunds, NOTHING! The cops were  even called at one point to ""help"" with stress. We have no car til we land in florida, if we ever do. So what are we supposed to do? Delta does not think about their customers at all! So I guess we'll camp in the airport all night. 36 hours no sleep because of these morons"
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Delta has gone from my favorite to an unacceptable way to fly,"Delta was my favorite airline. Not anymore. They can't arrive on time. And then when you re-book a week later they charge you double fare. I was to leave LEX at 10:28 today for DWT. I had 19 people waiting for me for a meeting. at 1:00. The plane landed at 2:00, should have landed at 10:30. Only use Delta for flexible leisure travel. Not if you expect to close a contract."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Not Again.,"Flight delayed from 4.26 pm to 8.16pm. No reason given other than the technicians were working on the maintenance. Ground staff unperturbed. Pre assigned a seat without an option, even though I checked in early. Rude flight attendants. Good side - the Chief Flight attendant came over to get my details over a sugar laden meal that was the only option for me not others. Baggage destroyed."
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Just not that great.,Just not impressed at all. The A/c works on the ground and that’s about all. In the air it blows hot. This is the 4th time to fly with Delta that this has happened. It’s also the last.
Date of travel: October 2021,10,Dont fly Delta,"I gave a 1 for ""likeliness to recommend"" only because they dont offer a ""0"" option.  my fiance and i were at our gate EXACTLY 15 prior to departure as is the policy of Delta only to be told our flight left early.  we were told the the doors were shut and could not be opened later to find out THAT THIS IS NOT TRUE.  argued as we looked at the plane RIGHT THERE outside the window..HOW DOES AN AIRLINE LEAVE EARLY WHEN ALL PAID SEATS ARENT FILLED..leave on time sure. BUT NOT FREAKIN EARLYI REPEAT ...DO NOT EVER FLY DELTAnot to mention Atlanta is a delta hub oh and also lost a lot of money on pre arranged activities at my destination due to Deltas decision to ""leave early""customer service on the phone was a freakin joke"

Date of travel: July 2021,10,Horrible Customer Service,"What I really want to do is provide feedback on the customer service they provide over the phone.It is rude and completely indifferent to customers. After I realized that my problem could not be solved with a representative, I asked to speak with the manager (Ethel). And, she also was rude and didn't want to help. She gave me so many excuses that I didn't expect to hear from such a large company. After the call, I wanted to leave a review and stayed on the line, but she dropped the phone and I couldn't leave a review right away. Therefore, if you do not want to receive this type of customer service, do not use Delta. I will not fly with this company anymore !!!"
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Worst Customer Service team,Worst customer service team in airline industry not willing to listen your concern . charged my card wrong and then not able to help .
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Never volunteer your seat for flight credit ....,"The flight was sold out and they were looking for volunteers to give up their seat for a later flight and was offering $500 worth of flight credits/person. My wife and I gave up our seats. The agent put us on a later flight and told us that we could stick around to see if there are any no shows. At the end there were 2 no shows and we were able to board and sit in two middle seats in the last 2 rows. We gave up our front row seats that were together as they promised us the flight credit. They told us we will get the flight credits in 6-8 weeks and nothing showed up. After spending 2 hours on hold, finally I was able to talk to a 'supervisor' and she said she will investigate and get back to me. Called me back today and said 'as you were able to get back on teh same flight' we can't offer any credit. I have flown over 1 million miles on this Airline and I gave up my seat and my wife' seat and they are telling me....thanks for your offer...we gladly took it but sorry we can't give you any flight credit. Asked if I could talk to a supervisor and the answer was I am the supervisor. What a terrible way to treat people who have been so loyal to your airline for over 30 years!! Never will volunteer my seats again..."
Date of travel: September 2021,30,Terrible first class,"Delta has gone downhill. Their first class seats are old and hard; totally uncomfortable.  And their MEAL service (as in ""breakfast"" or ""dinner"" not just ""snack"") was horrible. They drop a box of wrapped items (with wrappers that are nearly impossible to open), and the items seem to be a bunch of samples from companies I've never heard of. And the chicken salad sandwich was miserable -- very little chicken, grape jelly on one side of the large, cold, rubbery bread roll. The flight attendants were nice, but perhaps too nice -- they wouldn't and didn't have passengers raise their seatbacks before landing (or after), so we had to struggle to get out.Overall, I don't understand how Delta got to be #1 in Customer Service. These flights were not nearly as good as the recent American and United flights I've recently been on."
Date of travel: October 2021,40,No First Class Passengers Allowed in the Delta Lounge for Free,"That doesn't seem right.  What more do I need to do. You would think they would allow me in their lounge after getting their most expensive ticket. No, they wanted me to have some kind of upscale American Express card as well.  I had a burger in the airport cultural garden instead.  This trip didn't start out too well.  Actually the garden was pretty nice and the burger quite tasty. At the gate, there was an incredibly boring gate agent talking all kinds of nonsense. Like he was saying something about a recent trip he took and how different the scanner is they have here from where he went. Nobody cares. I just wanted to get on board for some reason. He tried to come off real folksy and friendly like. I'm not sure why he's so annoying. Maybe it's because when I got on the plane , I saw all these people passing me by and how close I was to them...  I put on a  second mask. This pandemic got me so anxious all the time.  I mean you can follow my thinking, right?  Anywayon the plane, i began to wonder what all the other people were thinking when I started spraying down my pillow and blanket with the mini Lysol Grace gave me. Looked like most people on board didn't care. I'll tell you what - flight attendants were real friendly and nice. I'm a bit surprised because I thought they were all up-tight and grumpy because of the recent hassles they get from passengers because of the mask mandates. Rolling out to that runway I always see when I'm at Hickam Beach was kind of cool so I videoed it.  And so the flight starts. Not too impressed with this first class seat I had. I didn't see any kind of hand control for the entertainment screen. It's all touchscreen.  Don't worry, I cleaned it with Chlorox wipes first. It's kind of far from the seat so it was hard to see especially for a blind old man like me. The seat itself was comfortable enough I guess since it lays out flat. I had a couple Bloody Marys made with Finlandia Vodka.  They didn't have any lemon to put in it so that was disappointing. It was a box meal for lunch. Actually a tasty spring chicken salad with strawberries and spinach and walnuts. Certainly not a first-class meal but you know the pandemic gives them a reason to go quick and cheap. Saw only  one movie: Francis McDormand in Nomadland. It's really a movie about absolutely nothing, but she's such a strong actress that she pulls it off.  After that I tried to get some sleep but no such luck. We landed and I'm in my hotel now. Did stop first and over ate some fast food.  Will try to get into Canada tomorrow. Oh yeah so my flight was okay enough I guess.   What are you gonna do? It is what it is."

Date of travel: August 2021,10,ZERO customer service,"I booked a round trip business class/ economy ticket from SFO to Rome with an option to "" change flights""  My return flight was changed to a 6 am departure.It is impossible to change a flight or get in touch with a human.The ""modify flight"" function online does not  work and has not worked for two monthsThe ""contact us"" function online does not  work and has not worked for two months.The hold time by phone is over three hours and they disconnect you after one hour( after paying 25 cents a minute for an overseas call( I am in Rome)Delta has discontinued the phone function to leave your number and have them call you back.No one answers the texts- they just direct you to use their online functions which do not work.What is the point of booking a changeable ticket if you can't change it?"
Date of travel: September 2021,20,Customers service is a joke!,"There is no customer service at Delta! It’s basically, sit online for hours, literally hours or on the phone for hours, literally hours, for help with what should be a simple problem.  You don’t base the quality of service on the fact that they get you to your destination on time, that is what you pay for, you base it on the quality of the service when you have a question, a problem, or a concern, for which they have no and I stress no ability to take care of your issue in a timely manner."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Intolerable,"We used a traveling agency to book are trip to cancun, We had direct flights there and back until Delta decide to switch are flight's more than once, we now have a direct flight there and a connecting flight back. We where fine on the way there however on the way back to check in we had to call delta first finding the right phone number the one  they provide is in spanish and gives you no time to react same with the second number, when you finally  get thru be prepared for a long wait it was two hours. everytime i try checking inn it keep telling me see an agent we finally got thru and she apologized,  everything was ok until we got to our connecting state Utah, my spouse uses a wheelchair the guy wheeled her up the ramp and left her we had fifteen minutes to go to baggage claims and get our luggage take it to check baggage with limited assistance then go back thru security where they had to have my spouse stand up so they can pat here down, Not once but twice and check her carry on by hand after it cleared the x-ray machine. Just for me to push her to the other end of the airport for our flight not to mention our seats where taken Sorry Delta you just dropped to the bottom of our choices of Airlines."
Date of travel: September 2021,50,Fantastic Experience on our  Bucket List Trip to EU,"First time on Delta in a number of years.  Very impressed.  All personnel from check in to flight attendants were professional, courteous, helpful and personable.  The Club was clean, comfortable and well stocked.  The plane was clean, smelled great and the boarding process well managed.  Had a 1 in a million issue that delayed the take off for over an hour.  The Captain kept everyone well informed and the flight attendants were attentive and responsive.  Restaurant quality meals.  We will definitely begin flying with Delta more in the future.We were late arriving in Amsterdam and missed our KLM connecting flight.  Went through the tedious Passport Check into the EU zone from our International zone but once at the Immigration Control Point, everything was very professional and expedient.  The KLM Club was spacious, clean and well stocked.  At check in, the Concierge already had us booked on the next available flight in the same class and same seats as on our original booking.  Every detail was handled seamlessly.  We had a flight attendant on our AMS - BUD that was on her last flight with KLM (moving on to another career).  Everyone on the plane helped celebrate her tenure and that made the flight quite personable and a great deal of fun.  First experience in over 15 years with KLM and Very Impressed!"
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Customer service at Delta has plummeted.,"I purchased my tickets months in advance.  Then Delta repeatedly changed the flights so they no longer connected.  Each time this happened I tried to reach Delta by both telephone and internet.  Their telephone said the wait time was 110 minutes and after over 180 minutes I hung up having tired of their choice of music that I was forced to listen to.  On their website, wait times were over 90 minutes before I reached artificial intelligence that told me to try to reach Delta via telephone.  Never again!"
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Total night mare,"Booked a group trip with Delta Vacations to celebrate a couple birthdays including my husbands, paid extra to upgrade our seats, and they've now changed the flights a million times, have people from our group travelling on different days, have couples not seated together, and now are forced to stay overnight in Atlanta on our way home.  This looks nothing like the dream vacation we booked anymore, and they think that it's fine to screw people over in the name of covid!  I've traveled a few other times during covid with other airlines, nothing like this nightmare at all!  Will never use Delta Vacations or Aaberg Travel Design again!"

Date of travel: September 2021,40,Good flight,Flight was good. Ahead of schedule both ways.  Attendants were all friendly. Was a smaller plane and the seats were tiny. If you are big you wont fit. After paying for airfare do you really need to charge extra for wifi?
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Tired of canceling,"This is the 4th time in a year that we have booked morning flights out of El Paso and they have been canceled. Rumor has it that if the plane is not full they will cancel no matter the airline. If this is the case then stop booking morning flights. I see my daughter a couple times a year so an afternoon down the drain because of a canceled flight is a big deal.Then you call and the airlines do t want to help, They say they have no control, they do not offer refunds, they only give excuses that you can have a later flight or next day flight which may get canceled too.I pay good money to have her fly home and for me to fly out there and I am tired of this happening every time and no one cares.

Date of travel: September 2021,10,9 hour flight took 2 days,"Flew KLM first class international outbound and Delta back. KLM experience was wonderful with attentive staff several good meals and snacks,and an excellent wine/spirits menu. Delta however was terrible. Flight Crews were inattentive at best,and difficult to find when we went looking for someone.Meal/snacks were cold dry, and few choices. Red or white wine offered without a menu. Connecting flight delayed 4 times over 5 hours then cancelled outright. Two employees were available to reschedule and we waited in line for 3.5 hours only to be told the next available flight was in 2 days...and no compensation for hotel nights were offered. Delta should be ashamed of what they have become."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Ig @thebunnygrey real review,"Real review instagram @thebunnygrey    Horrible horrible horrible you’re traveling internationally do not take Delta they use air France the worst aircraft I’ve ever been on they use recycled air so it’s very hot and stuffy the whole plane ride. Then the next aircraft remove me from the flight because the three flight attendants were rude disrespectful discriminate horrible tone voice.    Then the next aircraft taken believe me I prefer cold and the aircraft was beyond freezing it was having icicles that were falling from the windowsill inside the aircraft even the guy next to me says I’ve never been on an aircraft it’s this cold it was freezing as if you were in Alaska during coldest month of year.     Then when I get back into America Air France left in my suitcase in Paris. They are so on organized and careless that I didn’t even have my big suitcase with all the Necessities for over two days after my arrival.    To make matters worse then recovering from a Reconstructive major nose surgery in turkey, beskitas two days later I’m having to drive by car back to international airport in Georgia to pick up my suitcase that never arrived when it should have when I arrived!    Then following the trip I’m calling customer service to tell them it’s horrible experience and they just keep giving you all different number so if you just don’t end up speaking to somebody at the end of the day!    Mark my words, I will never ever fly Delta international again being that they partnership with Air France! Delta get with it figure out a better connection to have said an unorganized not efficiently run Air France   I shouldn’t of had to pay $1250 for a round-trip plane ticket you guys should’ve been paying me for such a horrible experience. And I requested a full refund being that this was an awful awful time experience coming back and yet I was not responded back to    Feel free to check attachment that was my plane ticket to show that what I’m saying from connecting flight Turkey to connecting flight to Paris to Atlanta was nightmare along with a delayed suitcase etc. etc.     When I made all those phone calls to Delta being ignored about having a refund you guys would’ve save a lot more money having me the refund and Refraining from writing this poor review well deserved for people to make sure they don’t take an international flight with Delta/air France good job!!! I hope this helps anybody else that’s trying to find a Good to great international airlines it wouldn’t be this one"
Date of travel: July 2021,10,"Horrible experience, worse customer service.","This trip was a birthday trip for my 11 year old daughter, the flights to San Diego were okay with the exception of the seating I paid extra to have assigned being changed on us. The return flight to Tampa was a complete nightmare: about 20 minutes AFTER we were supposed to begin boarding they made an announcement that the flight would be delayed until THE NEXT MORNING. Turning a 9pm Saturday flight into a 9am Sunday flight. They couldn't provide hotels, rental cars, food vouchers, nothing to make up for the rebooked flight. Us and about 90% of the oarders slept in the airport. My 11 year old daughter, my boyfriend, and myself, had to sleep in the airport lobby. Throughout the night we got notifications that this flight was being delayed EVEN FURTHER. The next morning we did not board until nearly 1130 which made our arrival time back home about 10 or 11pm, an entire 24 hours lost because delta had no backups for this flight. Not only were we not boarded until another two hours later than initially promised for a flight that was already delayed for 12 hours, once again my paid seating was no longer assigned to me or my daughter, they had moved her seating to an exit window rows away from me. We kept our originally seating and they had to reseat the boarders they sold MY PAID SEATS to. The final straw was my boyfriends luggage not arriving with us back in Tampa. Despite us checking all our luggage in at the same time his somehow didn't make it into the flight we were on and wasn't going to arrive until midnight, about 2 hours after we landed. We just chose to get it shipped to us. After all this delta refused any kind of refund, no refund on the seating fee I paid that was not honored, no partial refund for a flight that was essentially rebooked, nothing but flight credit for a company I'm never going to use again. The excuse is that we still got from point A to point B but when you book a flight you're not JUST paying for passage, you're paying for a seat you selected, your luggage to be where you are, the time you selected to fly and arrive, not to lose an entire day, sleep in an airport, and basically have no other choices. If we could have not taken the flight we would have.Tl;dr: delta will make your travel plans useless, rebook you and and call it a delay, then tell you you don't deserve your money back because they still got you home a day late after sleeping in an airport without 1/3 of the luggage you left with."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,VERY BAD EXPERIENCE ON SEP 13 at JFK,"Our flight was schedule for 8:10, we were at the airport at 5am. The self service machine were all out of service. The line was not super long, but the agents were taking their time. I was traveling to DR, eticket is required, the app can be completed even one week ahead of flight. When we got to the agent, he lied and said, “it needs to be completed two hours before departure.” (DR requires the ticket not the States). We took 5 minutes to complete the application and the agent said, we were late to check in for our flight. Multiple passengers missed their flight. In order to get on a later flight with delta, we each had to pay 600 dollars. The agent said we were not responsible, when it was clearly them who did not let us board. We ended up traveling with jet blue, and they didn’t even ask for the electronic application to enter DR. The service by Delta was horrible, and they clearly made it their business to prevent people from flying that day."

Date of travel: September 2021,10,Delta sucks,"Delta airlines is one massive steaming pile of dog sht. I've never had good experiences with them. I'm waiting at the airport right now for the next four hours because they messed up my flight. Get my money back? Psyche! These programs are not designed for refunds, in fact delta reps are trained to deny them all initially. The seating is inhumanely tight. Hey delta, you suck. Sincerely, I'd like for you guys to all suck my ball sack, after I haven't showered for a week."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Will never fly delta again,Short summery we were put on a old plane with carpet coming up and table trays broken and during landing me had landing gear failure….. plane took us back in sky to assemble crash emergency crew and after ruff landing plane landing gear so messed up we couldn’t pull to gate! Nobody acknowledged the situation after and delta didn’t try to reach out to inform us what happened attempted to call them and was on hold 2 hours jus for supervisor to tell rep to tel me not her problem and told me complain on the online website Never again my lively hood and family is so important any they have no regards to human life just the billions of dollars!!!
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Horrible customer service!,Delta should spend more money on customer service and less with the critical race theory junk that they shove down the employees throats! The gate attendant at Atlanta “Destiny” was horrible and rude.
Date of travel: September 2021,10,DELTA IS GETTING HORRIBLE!!!,Remember when you used to fly delta because that’s where you  got the best service. You paid a little extra but there service was on point. Not anymore now I have flown 3 times in a row and every single time me and my two year old are thrown to the side our seats aren’t booked together even though we are on the same reservation. We don’t have seats at all even though we book 3 months in advance  every time. People schedule flights certain ways to accommodate there plans in the visiting city. Delta has no regard for any of that they hardly even hire helpful friendly ticket agents like before they have become just as bad as the rest. Pick the cheap silt lime it’s the same crap anyways.!!!
Date of travel: August 2021,50,I highly reccommend,I highly reccommend these airlines. Due to hurricane im Mexico me and my friends couldn't get to the airport ( ferry couldn't take us from Isla Mujeres to the jucatan peninsula).

Date of travel: September 2021,20,Delta's Sky Miles,"I have been using my Amex since 2006 and have been accumulating miles to use for travels. I never bothered checking Delta's statements but I recently called to find out where my miles went when I have hardly used it. To my surprise, when I login to my account on Delta.com, there are no records of where the miles went, unless very recent. I called their offices after holding hours on the phone and no one, including the supervisor, had an answer for me! I even sent an email to their CEO, Mr. Bastian and then a few days later I sent a message to him on Instagram with absolutely no response! I don't trust them anymore so I suggest for everyone keep their Delta statements and make sure you keep records of them at all times.p.s. what is this all about Delta's hold time of 5 hours. I even decided once to hold on, but no one picked up!! Not sure how these organizations run their companies anymore!!"
Date of travel: September 2021,10,CROOKS !!!,"Stay away from this airline ! Their app will increase the price of the ticket if you look at it more than once ( each time you look for an option and don't buy immediately  - it will double the price by the hour ). Its So Evident , they should be ashamed to abuse their own potential clients.The app will always tell you that there is only one or two tickets left , to pressure you into paying Ridiculously high rates . Then , when you board the plane , its half empty .ABUSIVE CROOKS ! Please Avoid being robbed by Delta Airlines. Fraudulent Company."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Delta sucks,These a- holes  delayed us checking in 45 minutes because the person in front of us needed an extra carry on bag.

Finally after weeks of intermittent calling, the system offered me a 2hr callback. I took it. Once contacted they immediately found my SkyMiles acct!  But she said it wasn't active. I didn't fly from 2015 to 9/21, but that's no reason to cancel me! So after 15 mins on hold she said they had me in their system as DECEASED. Another 15 mins to reactivate acct. But, now  she is saying that they can't give me the miles for the flight I took because I booked it through EXPEDIA instead of through delta.com. How is that MY FAULT! I think that's bullsh*t.Will try to avoid delta even more in the future, hope I can hold out long enough that they will kill me again."
Date of travel: September 2021,50,Always the best service and feeling safe,"From the checking in to getting on board, you make us feel like family. The flight was on time very smooth. They really take pride in there work.             Thank You Doug (UT)"
Date of travel: September 2021,10,lost bag,they lost my bag and said it would be delivered which it never was and you can't get ahold of anyone to tell you anything. delta sucks!!!
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Unhappy customer,Delta airlines flight to Amsterdam  is delayed over 2 hours due to CATERING ISSUES!  The boarding process was designed by a JR High kid!  My absolute worst flying experience ever and we haven’t left the ground!  Traveling to Zurich so we will miss our flight and wait 6 hours. Delta is horrible!
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Military personnel treated like sh**,Get the f**koff delta! Terrible service! It was such a nightmare! Harassing me all day for using my own card for payment ! Know who your fraudsters are and stop condemning your own real customers. They Don’t even honor ppl that serve!  They messed up my whole day obnoxious! Nonsense! Today was my last day with y’all! United airlines here I come.
Date of travel: August 2021,20,An interesting flight with a pleasure of a messup,"After we finished our San Francisco trip it was time to go home once we boarded the plane obviously there was boarding music when we boarded the flight and after the boarding doors closed yet the music still kept going. I thought that was very Stupid delta did that. Once we got to Atlanta connecting back to Columbus another delay was encountered after we boarded plane and yet again the 2nd flight also had boarding music. After they closed the door the flight attendants reopened the doors they deplaned a passenger when the flight was full after boarding, I was like seriously? I wanna get home. Overall, I’m very disappointed with delta with how they handled both flights boarding music needs to be turned off after the doors close not keeping it on after boarding doors closed. I really do not recommend delta If you are flying with them. The delay cost me 30 mins of my bedtime and i was not happy with that. Avoid this airline if possible and use a different airline. Those delays we encountered were very unacceptable. Avoid this airline at all costs and fly with another airline"
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Poor attitude,"I recently flew with delta and the flight attendants have the absolute worst attitude ever! It’s as if they hate their job, I also flew with them 2 years ago and their attitude was bearable but not his time it was disgusting! They are mask nazis as well"
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Delta is Terrible,Terrible customer service.  Trying to make a slight change to a flight and been on hold for two hours.  They clearly do not care about their customers.  Fly Alaska or someone else.
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Will not fly Delta again,"We had tickets for a Saturday morning, so we drove to Columbus and spent the night at a hotel Friday night, since it was an early flight. We got to the airport with plenty of time to spare Saturday. We were told our flight was cancelled because a flight attendant did not show up for work. We weren’t happy, but rescheduled for later that day. We wasted the first afternoon of our vacation around Columbus, then when we got to the airport for our rescheduled flight, it was cancelled for weather (rain and lightning storm). We asked for a hotel room, we were denied. Had to pay for ANOTHER nights stay in Columbus and switch all our scheduled vacation plans around in Boston. Not at all impressed with Delta. Would not recommend."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Overall Experience,"Got bumped from a flight - no big deal.Received Gift Card from Delta as compensation for being bumped. - Great, TY!!!Gift Card - ZERO $$$ balance - Ok, weird... probably just a mistake. Customer Support #1 - 2 hr 45 min wait time, just to get disconnected - Irritated!!!Customer Support #2 - 2 hr 13 min wait time, call dropped - VERY Irritated!!!Virtual Cust. Support - Notified wrong depart., given number to call. Frustrated! Customer Support #3 (Different number) - Transferred 3 times. Currently as I type this review, been on hold for the last hour and 15 mins. Yeah... Delta Airlines is an amazing company!!! Save yourself a headache and fly another carrier."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Will avoid airline at all cost,We got pushed back then we’re told the aircraft had a mechanical issue so we had to go back to the gate. We sat at the gate for an hour then the pilot got on the intercoms and let everyone know the flight crew timed out so everyone had to get off the aircraft and wait for another crew. Everyone gets off the aircraft and has no idea what to do next tell I guess they annoyed the counter people enough for them to say on the inter phone the gate was moved to terminal A while we were all at Terminal E. Everyone go’s to terminal A to only be told to go back to Terminal A because the gate changed again. ( in the middle of all this they said another flight was leaving to Jacksonville but was already boarding but I ran over to the gate to see if I could get on board. The gate agents told me there was room on the aircraft but they would let me on as they were still boarding the aircraft.) We finally boarded the next flight to Jax over 2 hours later. The worst part about it is that no one from Delta gives a crap that I lost time with my family by this whole thing. I was trying to get home early to see my kids before having to fly out the next day but nope their aircraft breaks down the pilots time out and delta dosent say a word. I never really cared for delta but now I will avoid at all cost to not fly with them. They are so cocky that they forgot they exist to fly customers around. I guess the drop in flights due to covid didn’t hurt enough for them to lose their ego.
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Worst airline with no regard for customer’s time,We had a flight from Bozeman to Philly with a connection in Minneapolis. The aircraft had a pseudo maintenance issue (placard missing which was drawn and put on there as a substitute) and we missed that connection. We were placed on an 8 PM connection and on standby for a 1 PM (which also delayed almost two hours). After finding out it was oversold they removed five passengers and compensated them for their troubles (we received nothing) and were sent to the 345 PM. These compensated passengers whom have not been waiting or moving around flights like us due to delta’s error were put on the flight and we were told to go to the 8 PM flight. We missed a days work and lost money and valuable time due to their incompetence blamed on their procedural flaws (no fault of our own) but claimed they couldn’t (wouldn’t) do anything other than offer us 100 airline credit which we refused as we don’t want to fly with this airline again. Furthermore they wouldn’t even upgrade us as compensation. Delta dropped the ball several times and expects us to thank them. Don’t fly with delta. What a nightmare!!“Delta- We are ready when you are” should be changed to “We are ready to waste your time whenever you would let us.”
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Horrible experience,I usually don’t fly Delta but decided to try it. I’m sitting in the airport waiting to arrive to my vacation destination. Delta is looking for a plane for us and doesn’t know how long it will be. Airfare is expensive already. Now I have to sit and wait for God knows how long instead of enjoying my vacation. Salt Lake airport is under some kind of construction. And we had to sit in the plane on the tarmac for 30 plus minutes. The Delta Pilot said on the intercom that “the tarmac people need to get their crap together” he was frustrated at the process. We then had to walk for miles through temporary walkways to get into the airport only to proceed to walk a ton in the airport. I’ve never experienced anything like this in all my years of flying. I don’t think I will be choosing delta again. Delta assigned my seating not next to my husband and told me the plane was full so they wouldn’t even check to see if they could move anyone around so I can sit with him. Not comforting especially during a pandemic. I don’t want to sit in the middle of 2 strangers! Couldn’t delta at least try! Not flying Delta again!
Date of travel: July 2021,50,Always Amazing flying Delta,"Always chosing Delta when we go on vacation, usually CUN or PUJ. Never a delay.Recently lost a united flight and the next one wasn’t until next day afternoon. My wife purchased a delta ticket for next day in the morning 7am, price was right and flying back home was a relief. I understand that I lost that united ticket but had to get home after an international flight could not hang around airports one more day."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Double charged a total of $3080 and no response from Delta Customer Care!,"I paid $3710.24 in advance for a vacation package including flights and hotel stay to Orlando Florida. When I returned home I found that my credit card was charged $3408.53 for the hotel stay. I contacted Marriott and they looked into the matter. They found that they had not received payment from Delta Vacations. The cost of the rooms was $3080. That is the amount that I was overcharged. I contacted Delta Customer Care on August 6 and spoke to a very nice representative who apologized and was concerned that the response from Delta would be slow. I called Delta Customer Care again on August 20 and could not get through because of a 5 hour wait on hold. I then sent an email, and have had no response. I called again today, but Customer Care is only open M-F, 8:00 - 5:00 central time. Terrible customer service."
Date of travel: September 2021,50,Decent flights,I really had no issues. I mistakenly wrote a bad review earlier before realizing i had forgotten about a change i had made to my return flight. I don’t see how to change my previous review.
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Rip off,"I bought a same day ticket. I was charged for services I didn’t receive, such as insurance and an upgrade (yet I couldn’t pick my seats). The email receipt didn’t show the charges, just the flight info.  So later I was told it would be a two hour wait on the phone on hold to talk to a representative. On the app I sent a message which was ignored!!! There’s no other way to contact any customer service at delta."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,My 50th Birthday & Delta screws me again,"I’m flying first, son was booked at a later time & they wanted over $500 between comfort+ & 1st class so he was booked comf+. Delta doing their usual switch planes, times, itineraries….updates us to next plane change in first class. My son, who has the same last name, gets a 3 hour layover in Atlanta and booked on another flight in comf+. I just happened to be looking at our itineraries online to make transportation arrangements on the ground & saw this. No call to ask would he like to pay xtra to remain on the same flight or put in coach for the same price…nope, we’ll just separate the family & screw up my birthday dinner reservations on the ground. Forget about the time I took meticulously booking him online myself in order to avoid the ungodly wait time of having a delta agent help me  to book ( so I got to lose 2 hours waiting & sorry we can’t make you happy today, if u want him on that flight you will pay or take coach for the same $). Forget about the fact that Delta left him Atlanta in April this year knowing full well he was expected & fell back on their whole “we close the doors 15 mins prior to boarding.” Forget about the fact that we spent 4 hrs driving him bk & forth to Orlando so he could have less plane changes (more direct flight) to have Delta change his return trip & add another stop when I could have booked him myself directly from Melbourne & had the same amount of stops and he’d be home instead of us losing 4 more hours of our lives driving back and forth to a diff airport for no reason now. SICK, SICK, SICK of Delta screwing me up and then saying…Sorry, can’t do that…or saying stupid things like it will be 75,000 miles to upgrade for that leg of the trip. Forget that I paid xtra for comf+ but it would be an even trade to get him in coach (row 32) in a middle seat because that’s all they have available. So much for being a loyal Delta flyer for 30 years! Allegiant and Sun Country here we come! We fly to Vegas 4x a year…I guess Delta doesn’t need our support anymore. Customer service is a joke w/them now since the pandemic. Very unhappy. Want to buy my own plane!"
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Don’t Ever Leave the Airport,Delta is awful.  I would never recommend this company to anyone.  They continue to disappoint at every step.  They truly live up to Don’t Ever Leave The AirportWould give negative 5 stars if possible
Date of travel: September 2021,20,Screwed before we got on thhe plane,"We booked a trip to Scotland a month ago and had everything planned out, the other day Amsterdam changed the covid rules and when Delta had us flying back we would have via Amsterdam with a 2-day stay at the airport. Because it was KLM that canceled the flight's Delta said ""there was nothing they could do"" I called Delta and got them on Twitter explaining we could leave out of 4 other citys that were close by and again I got""there was nothing they could do"".The next day I start again on Twitter using what options I had and gave them a 3 DAY window to get us homeland they said""there was nothing they could do"". I ask them if I get myself to London can they get me on a flight,THAT they can do after hours of checking. So I have to BUY a ticket to London,so they can get me the rest of they way.I asked for better seats ""there was nothing they could do"" I ask for a voucher for the tickets I'm not using ""there was nothing they could do"" I talk to a supervisor ""there was nothing they could do"".Just forget Delta is a airline,your better that way."
Date of travel: September 2021,20,Fast flight but very slow service at Delta baggage check at PUJ (Punta Cana),"Make sure you hold your passport out  because you have to show it several times (5 times) before going through security if you’re checking your bags. Also, make sure you complete the attestation form online. The people at baggage check are very slow. Also, the airline no longer offers the small blanket like before."
Date of travel: September 2021,50,Sesame Seed Alert,"Please note that if you have a sesame seed allergy please call 800-221-1212.  The staff will ensure that you can order a special meal if you have a food allergen, food sensitivity or a dietary preference.  True allergens are taken seriously."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Delta Employees are thieves,"DO NOT TRUST DELTA and their Employees.  I took a flight last week in August from Atlanta GA into Ronald Regan Airport.  My bag was not checked in.  Once arriving at the gate, they tell you that there's no room for your bag which leaves you with the option to trust them with your bag after giving a last minute ticket or to make a scene which will cause you to kicked off of the plane.  I was hesitant and DID NOT want to leave my bag because of valuables that I had packed to attend a wedding.  Fast forward, when I landed, I was the first person at baggage claim and stayed until the bags stopped coming.  The bag never came, the employees at the station pretended to look for the bag by calling to the back but the employees did not answerer.  They are all in this together.  This was also reported on the local news about theft and the games played.  In this case, it was Delta that prides themselves on integrity  but it's false.  A police report was made with the airport police and the end results was that there was nothing they could find because cameras were not in the back where the bags come in, useless .  How can cameras not be stored in the back?  I'll tell you, it's because the theft is intentional and planned.  BEWARE OF DELTA's EMPLOYEES and lack of empathy and concern.  Your only option is to file a claim and get only a third of your valuables back in 30 day, maybe.  DELTA'S EMPLOYEES ARE THEIVES."
Date of travel: September 2021,50,Best Airline Experience in a LONG time...,I've had some terrible experiences with AAnother AAirline and decided to try Delta for a change. WOW - what a treat. Our layovers were uneventful. Our flights were on time. Our attendants were friendly and cheerful. Our luggage arrived with us. Our food and beverage service was pleasant. It was a delight to have such a routine experience - although the fact that it was uneventful made it quite memorable!
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Can't check luggage 42 minutes before flight. We flew bags didn't.,"So get to tallahassee airport an hour before flight. Park, walk from parking lot up to airport get in line, get to check in desk and they tell us we can fly however our bags can't fly. It's 42 minutes before take off and can only check bag's 45 minutes before take off. This is some new bs rule for all delta at every airport. Tallahassee airport is crazy small. Top it off we going to a funeral and all the other flights are on stand by. Plus Delta has zero alternatives to send luggage. So walked back to parking lot, put suit cases back into car. Went back to airport went thru TSA and still waited 20 min to board. Just a sad broad stroke policy the company has adapted. Really disappointed, tho not surprised that they let us down."
Date of travel: August 2021,40,Good Experience,"Flight home from vacation. We chose the ""Comfort Plus"" seating, and did not regret it. The flight was around 3.5 hours, and the extra legroom of the Comfort Plus class was a great help to not feel cramped and trapped for hours. The in flight entertainment choices were plentiful, with a number of current movies and TV series shows, and live channel options as well. The attendants were professional and friendly. The captain was also very professional and provided a smooth flight from takeoff to landing."
Date of travel: September 2021,40,Nice experience,This was the connecting flight for my red eye flight and it was again surprisingly packed!! Overall it was a good experience. Flight attendants were great and we landed early so that was extremely helpful. I really wish I could watch movies on my iPad instead of the screen because most of us no longer have the headphone outlet for the screen anymore. I love how the pilots and staff line up at the doorway to bid you farewell! That means a lot and gives me the opportunity to say thank you.
Date of travel: September 2021,40,Great experience,This was a red eye flight and was surprisingly packed!! Overall it was a good experience. I love how the pilots and staff line up at the doorway to bid you farewell! That means a lot and gives me the opportunity to say thank you.
Date of travel: September 2021,20,Post pandemic travel blues on Delta,"Well just completed my first post pandemic international trip to Paris (and a few other European locales).  By way of background, I have been on many First/Business class intercontinental flights on almost all the larger carriers.We were excited to try Delta’s relatively new “suite” product aboard the Airbus 330.  At first glance, it looks like a great product.  The configuration is 1-2-1 so all seats have an aisle access.  Unfortunately, the seat was not so comfortable (a bit stiff with no real ergonomic support), the arm rests are set too high and become uncomfortable. On my flight the door to the suite was broken and the touchscreen (on the, nice large TV) was inoperative.  Where Delta has really given up the ghost is on food service.  I’ve flown them recently from SLC-TPA, CDG-JFK and JFK-SLC, all in Business and I’ve yet to get a nice meal.  On this flight — a premium city pair Paris to New York, they supplied no physical menu.  Wine offerings were white or red (not multiple of each which is typical).  On the other flights to Tampa and SLC (these were 5 hour dinner flights), I’ve been given a box with either snacks or a really dreadful sandwich.  Most people are not enthralled about wearing a mask for hours and hours on end and I’ve told Delta that skimping on food an beverage aboard is not the way to get the higher end customers back.  By contrast, I flew AirFrance from JFK to CDG (as a codeshare) and the seat, food and beverage was far superior (a menu, multiple entree and wine choices,  working seats and monitors, etc.)Just something to keep in mind before you plunk down your money for a European trip and get disappointing food beverage and seating!"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Worst service,"Worst airline to fly overseas with. Bad food, bad timing, and even worse services. They lost my luggage on my connecting flight which which I didn’t make because they can never stick to a schedule. Also ended up having to stay in Amsterdam for 19 hours because they were late to my connecting flight. Would never recommend or ride with them again."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Customer,"Rena at the check in counter was horrifically rude.   We approach the counter to have our bags weighed and she snapped “What are you doing here” and it only went downhill from there.  Beyond rude and unprofessional. Also, when guests happily greet you, you should greet them back. She doesn’t fit the friendly Delta mold that the rest of the employees have."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Extremely Unreliable,"I had booked a round trip to New York for me and my daughter; direct flight. They changed it to layover and then, they changed times of flights. I did not complain. Once we arrived to Atlanta for the connection flight, the train that was supposed to transport us to the right concourse stopped working. We arrived to the gate a couple of minutes late and they did not let us board the flight. Then, they put us on the standby list. And even though it was not our fault that we were late to board the plane because of their train and the short period of time they gave us to go from arrival gate to departure gate, nobody, not even the Delta help desk would bother to place us first in the stand by list. We missed the three next flights. Never ever will fly Delta again."
Date of travel: August 2021,20,"Delay Flights, no support from Delta Staff. You are on your Own.","My flight was Delayed and unfortunately it was unacceptable for the time line that I had. I needed a guarantee that I was going to arrive in Atlanta for a meeting I had the next morning at 7AM. The Delta representative at the RSW counter only had 1 response ""you know as much as I do"". She could not give me anymore information than that. I checked in to the flight early on my departure day (08/29/21) that morning prior to receiving the delay notification on the mobile app. Then I received an email that evening notifying me that the flight was delayed and that I could cancel and get a refund or look for another flight. Apparently after you check in on the app it does not allow you to cancel the flight and get a refund. Also there were no other available flights to my destination. I tried to call customer support, over a two hour wait. Then I decided to go to the airport to speak to the rep. After I spoke to the rep there and told me what I mentioned. She advised to sit at the airport until she got new information, that she can't guarantee the flight will not be canceled. I made the decision to rent a car and drive to Atlanta. If I left at that moment I would be there that night and make my morning meeting. As I was driving I simultaneously call customer support and chat to get a refund. I spent the entire 8:30 hour drive to Atlanta on hold on both chat and phone with out no assistance from Delta airlines. I submitted that evening a refund request form online and I still have not heard anything back."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Ridiculous delays,"Flight was delayed over 4.5 hours for no explicable reason. I understand when there are weather related delays, but this was not the case for my flight. Numerous Delta flights were also seriously delayed while no other airline really had any delays. We’re it not for the pilot, the flight would have been canceled. He had to push for them to release a plane for us. Ridiculous. Delta is no longer a top choice of mine and I will only take it in the future if it is the only option. If I want this service, I’ll pay half the price and fly bloody Spirit."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Horrible,"Delta really had me sitting at the airport for 14 hours and counting smh. Plane delayed 4 times, while I'm watching other flights go to the same destination smh. This is ridiculous. Then tell me there's no standbys, as I watch them call standbys 🤦🏾‍♂️#NeverAgain #dontflydeltaCustomer service sucked, the supervisors telling me they don't know what to say or what to do is very unprofessional. Also Donna was very rude.  I received no compensation or anything even tho this delay cost me thousands of dollars and time I can never get back."
Date of travel: April 2021,50,"Excellent service, will choose Delta whenever possible","The crew were wonderful with our two very boys, offering them snacks and drinks throughout the flight to keep them busy. The captain was very reassuring with respect to the airline's rigorous covid and safety practices. At the time they were also running intentionally quiet flight to ensure some degree of physical distancing. Could not have had a better airline for returning to the US. Will choose them wherever possible."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Worst airline.,"Cancelled my flight  and  changed fir the next day. No hotel or food voucher. They have 0 customer service, was on the phone for 2 hours no answer"
Date of travel: July 2021,20,Get ready to pay for that checked luggage,"Delta/KLM is terrible, avoid at all costs. You must pay a crazy price for checked luggage and the price associated is higher than what is listed in the fine print. The seats were tiny and uncomfortable and the food is garbage. I would gladly pay another airline more just to avoid."
Date of travel: September 2021,10,Horrible Horrible!!!!,"I took the first flight and it was cancelled due to bad weather. I waited for around 4 hours but I understood the situation. So I re-booked my second flight. I am still waiting for take-off. I've waited for more than 1hour. But delta say that they don't give compensation to passengers. Wow.. It is my horrible experience ever!!! My time is very precious. As much as I understood the first flight's delay and cancel, Delta must give me compensation. Still Delay Delay Delay!!!!! Time is extended wow.. So Terrible!!!!!!!!!!"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,BEEN ON HOLD FOR 6 hours,Absolutely terrible customer service. I have been on hold for over 6 hours. Their robot chatting system is god awful. All I need is to add my pet to my reservation and there is no simple way to do so online. You have to call them. Awful. I’m absolutely sick of being on hold.
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Terrible experience missed dates,We decided to give Delta a shot at first class to Hawaii because we heard they were good...wrong. they changed our flight 3 times prior to leaving causing me to change my connect small plane twice at a cost of over $250. was looking forward to a nice meal as you usually do on first class ... boxed meat and cheese at 7am unbelievable.The disappointing thing it was worse on the way back. The wine served was worse than box wine. Then to top it off they broke my golf clubs and told me too bad.Never again would rather fly spirit
Date of travel: August 2021,30,Delta Care Standard - NOT!!!!!,"I realise that this spot is for reviews for flights taken, however, I feel compelled to tell you of my DISSERVICE I received from CSR Christine(a) on August 30, 2021 for my upcoming flight to Hawaii.  Anyways, August 29, 2021 I spent over 3 hours on the phone and could not get through regarding the second bout of changes in two weeks for my upcoming flight. On August 30th I began the process of calling Delta at 3:45am? and after 2 plus hours finally got through to CSR Christine(a) - YEAH! Well I will spare you all the details of our conversation (which I have sent to Delta - awaiting response) I will only say that Christine(a) was rude, ignorant, aggressive and delivered absolutely NO Customer Service.  Christine(a) did not give one bit of concern about solving my issues and I was left with a very bad taste towards Delta.  I understand during these trying times people have bad days, however, at the end of the day you still have a responsibility to treat people/CUSTOMERS nicely and with respect!  I am in fact a customer that paid for a service/product and it is not being delivered.  Why, Why??? Delta higher ups please investigate this because this particular CSR should not being doing this job??  Wayne Smith"
Date of travel: August 2021,20,Would NOT choose Delta,"This is my second time flying with delta and both times have been terrible. Delayed flight, lost luggage, and horrible customer service. I will NOT be using Delta again."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,The Enron of Airlines...,They double charged me for 1 flight. Their customer service kept me on hold for 2.5 hours before I gave up. I emailed them and after several days they finally got back and said they couldn't do anything and were closing my case....
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Burned out Delta staff. Poor service despite top dollar flights.,"Delta has fallen from its lofty place, IMHO, in 2021. As a platinum medallion member for two years, I travel frequently. The problem is service. At one time this airline was so great. Now....poor poor poor! Waiting for return calls from the Platinum Medallion reservations desk for hours longer than stated by the automated attendant. Sometimes, never getting a reply. Mesaage us is non-existent. I have been waiting for 2 hours for an attendant. Flight changes are impossible online. The ""Modify Flights"" tab does not give all the availble filights...only the ones Delta wants you to have.These issues have just been increasing over the past 3-4 months. I can see some issues with the uptick in travel but not this long. Food in first class is STILL boxes....others have started to give regular meals...not DELTA! The least Delta could do is to change some of the boxed ""lunches"" it provides. Maybe the Delta staff is just burned out ...I can see that.  The passengers are burned out too but...we are the ones who are the customers."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Lost Baggage,"Where do I begin… Flight attendants were late from the DCA flight to JFK. This delayed the flight for an hour…then there was a storm, so we sat on the plane for two additional hours, by the time we got to JFK we were 30 minutes late and everyone on the plane missed their international flights. I am a rational person and I understand things happened, but it was the way the flight attendants acted and responded to people during this distressed situation. The flight attendants were rude and inconsiderate to other passengers as well as myself. This was my birthday trip which is why are packed really important things for the special occasion. I also packed a carry-on precisely so they would not lose my bag however they made me check my bag when I was sitting in row 13 and they said that there was no more room. They didn’t give me any time to change or grab anything from me carry-on to put in my backpack, my bag never made it into the plane to Croatia and I was left in a foreign country without any of my belongings.I I had to stay in Dubrovnik when I was supposed to actually meet friends in another city and I spend my birthday alone without anything, no clothes no charger no computer no friends. How do you spend additional two $250-$300 in orderThat’s Bart a few things I needed like clothes, converter, a place to stay etc.  My bag was given to me 40 hours later, it was missing my hair straightener, And not having my bags really ruined the first two days of my trip and my birthday. Delta replied to my claim saying that they are not responsible for anything. I will never fly Delta  again."
Date of travel: August 2021,50,Excellent Service and Smooth Fly,"The service and cleanness at the airport, gate, and the aircraft was excellent.  Despite the long line, the check-in was quiet and efficient.  Food and entertainment aboard was very good with a great selection.  Passengers were following the rules re: masks."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Myself,I was not happy I was late  to get there due to lady overs  When I got there my luggage was not had to go back the next day to pick it up.  Then late returning home due to delays.  Plus once again luggage not there had to wait until the next day.
Date of travel: July 2021,40,Update To Non Existent Customer Service Review,"After months of calling and emailing Delta attempting to modify flight and eventually canceling, I am pleased to report that Delta customer service contacted me August 26th.  Delta not only returned my 17,000 miles, they bonused me 3000 more and refunded taxes paid.I would give Delta 5 stars if this whole thing was resolved in a more timely manner.Thank you Delta Airlines for proving that your customers are important."
Date of travel: March 2021,40,It was outstanding travel,Seriously It was an outstanding travel for me because I traveled in this aero plane first time and I feel lucky. Its all services were perfect and inside look was also amazing seriously I can't express my feelings in words. I will highly recommend you to travel in Delta Air Lines.
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Beyond Horrible,"I'm fairly new to flying but I can already tell you, I absolutely despise Delta. It's hard to chose where to start. First, boarding was a zoo. I'm a petite woman so it's not like I take up a lot of room and even I had trouble walking down the aisle without bumping seats and the people in them. The seats are insanely uncomfortable and I can't image how terrible they must be for the average person. Leg room is virtually nonexistent, and this coming from someone who is 5ft tall.  The cabins are hot. I understand you can't make everyone happy, but when you're sweating just by sitting there, something is wrong. You can always add a layer or blanket but I can't sit there naked. Please just turn on the air.It's quit funny how they want you to wear a mask, having a covid test, etc. but have no problem packing passengers in like canned sardines.Complimentary snacks? Not hardly. First, let's just say that a small up of water and a tiny pack of almonds are the least they could do considering the astronomical prices they charge. Also $30 for a checked bag? Do you expect people to travel with no luggage? They also do not have enough overhead bins for each passenger to have a carry-on. Another issue I've already encountered is that they will not uphold their own wording on their website. I don't have the time nor patience to go into that matter on here but just know, what you read on the Delta site may or may NOT be honored. They will simply say you misunderstood and that isn't their fault, regardless of the situation or proof provided they are in the wrong."
Date of travel: August 2021,30,"Not terrible, but not ""first class""","I found an affordable first-class ticket and was looking forward to a pleasant flight.  The experience wasn't bad, but almost everything about it seemed chintzy rather than ""first class"".I did have a comfortable seat, and a bottle of water and some earphones were provided at the start of the flight.  However it would have cost about $10 to get wi-fi access, a service that is available for free in economy on some other airlines.The flight attendant was pleasant, but the service was nothing special.  First class customers weren't even offered the little package of cookies they give out in coach on Delta.  Instead our ""meal"" was one of the snack boxes they have available for purchase to economy customers.  On a 5 1/2 hour flight this wasn't much of a meal.    I'd have far preferred the sandwiches that are also available for purchase, but only the snack box was provided in first class.Theoretically unlimited drinks were available, but the flight attendant came by exactly once with a drink service.  She didn't even give me the can from my Diet Coke.  Instead I got a tiny cup (the size of a bathroom water cup) that was mostly filled with ice.   Apparently alcoholic beverages were also available, but we were given no indication of that.  So a teeny cup of Diet Coke and that initial bottle of water were the beverages I was given on a flight from the Caribbean to the upper Midwest.I know service had been modified due to COVID, but seriously, how do you call this ""first class""?  I may fly Delta again, but it will definitely be back in the main cabin."
Date of travel: September 2020,10,DO NOT FLY DELTA,No integrity. Penalizing employees for not having vaccines. In past their customer service was rude anyway. After what i heard on news i will never fly delta again.
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Do not fly!,So unprofessional and they do not care about their customers or their employees! This is an awful company that should be avoided at all cost! Fly American instead!
Date of travel: August 2021,50,Delta is amazing all around . 💯 recommended,"I have to say , I am a harsh Critic and I am attentive to all details . Delta Surpass all my expectations with flying colors . I’m a member of another airline and hands down Delta Surpassed their services in all areas . Especially now in the the pandemic era. Excellent cleaning protocol , on time services and updated  flight  details sent to your cell; they are on top of all clients keeping masks on : excellent chh hi oí es in movies ; leg room; flight attendants are super attentive , the sweetest ( shout out to flight  )They provided snacks twice for 5 hour flight: check in very effective and fast . You Cannot go wrong here . I highly recommend flying Delta all year round and especially now during the pandemic era. They follow all cdc guidelines and ensure customer protection . I want to become a member . Def plan to sign myself up for future trips . Prior pandemic I traveled 3x a year with two kids , hubby and sometimes extended family. Worth it ."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Worst Vacation package ever,"If you don't want your travel company to be there when you need them then go to Delta Vacations (DV).  They completely abandoned us. and ruined our dream vacation and they think a token apology is all they need to do.  If you complain DV management hides behind the skirts of young woman that they hope you will feel sorry for.  I don't normally do reviews but people need to know what kind of shady operation they are dealing with.  Our vacation was booked through Delta Vacations.  They didn't leave enough time to transfer at JFK so we missed our connection.  Spent 7 hours locked in the terminal till Delta got us a motel so we could get a flight the next day.  Then had to spend 2 hours in the summer heat getting retested for COVID.  Called DV and they called resort to let them know we'd be late and asked to shift our stay so we got our 7 days at the resort.  They said they would let us know.  Day 2 we got to the resort.  Day 3 nothing from DV so I called (international call, long wait, sitting in room instead of beach for 2 hours) and DV said nothing from resort.  Because I called, they said they would send another email and let us know by email.  Day 5, Still nothing from DV even though they promised so once again I'm sitting in my room for 2 more hours.  No response from motel so because I called, they sent resort another email.  I asked if after 5 days they could possibly call the motel, ""NO"".  They said this was a priority and she would update me before she went home and follow up in the morning.  I asked for her name and she hung up.   Nothing from DV.  Day 6, I made one last attempt and got Taye, a DV supervisor.  No, they hadn't heard anything from the motel, because I called, they would send the resort an email.  This was the highest priority for DV.  Can you call resort ""NO"", I will call or email you.  She didn't.  I called to confirm our transport to the airport and the DV rep listened to my story and said that all they had to do was call her and she would've had it fixed in no time.  DV Customer support just didn't want to help me so they did the very minimum and then only when I pushed them.  I messaged/posted (deleted) them on FB that this was the worst vacation of my life and I wanted a full refund.  DV was sorry and wanted to talk to me.  Kathryn, one of their sugary sweet young lady called and apologized 100 times but said the only compensation she was authorized to extend was the refund for the day I lost and $400 in travel vouchers.  I said that was insulting for completely ruining our vacation.  I asked her if there was any record of them trying to call me.  She didn't see anywhere.  Did they try to email me She didn't see that anywhere.  I asked her that after 6 days and untold emails if she thought that they could've tried to call someone.  She said it wasn't their policy.   I asked her if she thought that this was good customer service.  No comment.  I will go back to my supervisor and see if there is anything else I can do.  I said if her supervisor was worth anything they would call me back.  A few hours later the sweet voice calls back and apologizes 10 more times and said she got them to go up another $200 to $600 in travel vouchers with DV.  That will probably be close to the cost of my phone bill.   I told her that was still unacceptable and asked to speak to her supervisor.  They don't talk to people.  Can I have your supervisor's name but she couldn't give me the name for my report.  If you want to relax and not worry about your travel agent having your back then avoid Delta Vacations."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Awful Staff Do NOT Recommend,"My daughter and I were travelling back from Los Angeles to the UK. When we walked up together hand in hand asking for the seat tickets the lady gave it to us and we got aboard the plane. When I checked our seats, my daughter’s seat and mine were not together (actually my seat was half way across the other side of the plane). As you can understand I don’t want my daughter sitting next to a stranger through a 8-12 hour flight especially since she’s young (7 years old). So we ask a member of staff about the issue and they said to ask the person who has that seat to swap with you. Understandable. So when the man arrives I ask him if he can swap his seat with mine so we can sit together, he therefore agrees and everything is fine. Or so I thought. About 10-20 minutes later the man starts to complain and wants his seat back and sit next to my daughter despite the fact we agreed on swapping. A member of staff approaches and asks what’s wrong and the man says even though we agreed to swap seats he’s upset about it. The lady who gave us the seat tickets came on board and asked me to go to my original seat so he can have his original seat back. I told her I wasn’t comfortable with that since I don’t want my daughter sitting next to a stranger for 12 hours and that we already agreed. So then I asked her why she gave us different seats in the first place and she said and I quote “You both came up to me separately so I thought you were separate passengers” MY DAUGHTER IS 7 AND WE WERE TOGETHER HOLDING HANDS WHILST WE GOT OUR SEAT TICKETS!! SHE LIED! So I called her out on her lie explaining how we were there together and she wasn’t happy with that so she threatened me and my daughter that we will get kicked off the plane if we don’t co operate! The man decides that it’s okay and he’ll sit in my original seat like we agreed on however throughout the rest of the flight, the staff were giving me the silent treatment and were giving me glares, side eyes and judgemental looks despite the fact I acted in a calm manner throughout the situation unlike the seat ticket lady who got sassy and disrespectful. They made me and my daughter feel uncomfortable throughout the whole flight. You need to teach your staff proper manners and how to deal with customers politely. They are extremely rude.Never travel with Delta. Their tickets are cheap for a reason!"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,This airline sucks. You need to train your employees how to be classy and appropriate,I was planning to fly from Chicago to Jacksonville (with one stop) it got delayed so I lost my second flight and I had to spend the night in the airport because this airline couldn’t provide trustable services. It was around 6 pm that I went to the Delta station at Chicago the supervisor was horrible and extremely rude and kind of inappropriate and an extraordinary RUDE woman called “MAREN” that was an absolutely awful human being insulted me and refused to give me the appropriate services. She needs to be fired immediately (she actually needs to get hospitalized). She is pretty dangerous. Anyways as she said this must give me a lesson. So the lesson is: NEVER EVER TRUST DELTA AIRLINE BECAUSE IT SUCKS 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻 If it was suggested to you in kayak or any other websites just run. They can’t even here appropriate people to represent their services. I hope dangerous Maren along with the supervisor get fired ASAP so everyone can travel safely.
Date of travel: August 2021,30,I miss Delta's formerly excellent service,"Flying Business over the Atlantic (50+ times) has deteriorated on Delta. No longer greeted with a Champaign or served a nice multi-course meal. Instead, a quick pass of the wine cart (with plastic cups), delivery of a tray with all courses of the meal including a small carton of ice cream (let's get it over with like a school cafeteria.) A few hours later I had to go to the front of the plane to ask the flight attendant playing on his phone if I could get a nightcap.  Of course, all blamed in Covid!  Whatever.  All this contrasted with Air France return flight that had real service, beautiful presentation, leisurely dining, pampering and, well, what the Delta of the Richard Anderson era used to provided.  If you're flying Business or First (especially on your own $$) look for alternatives to plastic-cup, Ed Bastion's Delta"
Date of travel: August 2021,30,Nothing exceptional,"This flight was leg #1 of our trip from Tucson to Vancouver.  We transferred through LAX.Okay, this was day #1 (August 9th) for Canada to allow Americans to come to Canada so we expected some hiccups along the way as things never run as smoothly on the first day.  The new entry requirements were a burden all by themselves (lots of hoops to jump through) so, we believed when we arrived at the check-in counter it would be smooth-sailing: every single required form, test, and necessary online ArriveCAN receipt was in-hand.Ah, but it was not to be.  All 3 counter personnel insisted we could not fly until August 21st.  Fast-forward 20 or so minutes with them making calls to their supervisors and updating their software, before we could progress to the TSA entry point.  Wouldn't you think they would come to work knowing what the requirements were and maybe check the info out before manning the counter?Anyway, the flight was quick (1 hour and 41 minutes) and our refreshment was water.   The plane was an Embraer 125.  It just seems like we are all paying more for less all the time.  We were not particularly impressed."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Awful,Went to change my flight on the delta app.  Went through put in payment information and the app stated oops can’t complete the transaction.  Then check my credit card and I was charged 375 twice and then for good measure another 375 on my bank account.  Best part is they never changed my tickets.  Cant get anyone to pickup the phone at reservations so I don’t know what flight I’m on and have been charged over a 1000 dollars for services never received.
Date of travel: August 2021,40,Very good but much better options out there.,"I guess in Skyteam is i like most families in the 70s and 80s and Thanksgiving. You have the Adult table and then you have the kids table. Delta is at the adults table, naturally, and Air Europa is at the kids table. When started booking my trip i went to delta website 1st and noticed not all skyteam members where showing up. So at Skyteam you have the adults and the kids and in my search i found Aeroflot and Air Eruopa are 2 of the kids. Heck even a Delta reservation agent said Aeroflot is not part of Skyteam. Lol. Lets give the positive 1st cause this will be a Delta bashing thread and i hate leaving negative reviews but i had to in this case:Positive: Delta Agents could not have been any nicer or more helpful. They did the best they could do. Even the supervisor was confused when explaining the problem below.  The flight attednats where terrific. the Captain on Delta flight 2229 was the best. He even told the cabin ""please be nice to the flight attednats they did make up the mask mandate so please do not be rude to them"" he then asked for military and vets to raise their hand to thank us.Negative (sorry but this makes no sense. There is no reason 2 Alliance partners can not check bags with each other)My girlfriend and i flew from Dallas to Tenerife with no layovers. DAL to MIA on Delta and MIA to TFN on Air Europa. Delta agents a DAL said that even though Air Europa is Skyteam they could not check bags on them. So when we get to Miami 1 of our bags showed up and they other did not so a 5 hr connection turned into almost missing our plane becuase Delta can not transfer bags i guess. Air Europa on the other hand my bags both showed together at the same time as i did. Maybe Delta needs to move to the kids table and Air Europa to the adults table.I would not recommend Delta after this.  The reasons are:  with no thru checking of bags on other carriers then you can save 300 bucks from the start on Southwest. I had to use main cabin in Delta to pick my seat. Which was about 2-300 more than Southwest wanna get away fares even adding the early bird on southwest you still save money and get 2 checked bags free which saves you another 40 bucks or more per bag. AND you still have to go claim your bags and go back thru security, just like we had to with Delta/Air Europa.I had very high expectations of Delta even got the Amex Delta Platinum card but after this i will be canceling the delta card and my skymiles account as i can not see a reason to fly Delta again.  Since i harldy ever leave the US and unless Southwest goes out of business i can not justify a financial reason to fly Delta again."
Date of travel: August 2021,20,Booked together? Tough luck,"Approached the podium well before boarding started to ask that my wife and I be seated together. The gate agent dismissively said ""no, with your class of ticket, no can do."" Now I understand, of course, that we are not entitled to sit in premium seats or forward on the plane.  But the fact that they did not put our seats together on the plane is a low move, contrasting with courtesy of other major airlines that we have booked with recently."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Do not fly delta!,All of the flight attendants especially Lucas and this Mexican lady threatened to arrest everyone on board FOR wearing their mask above their nose. Refused to give out food and drinks to everyone on board. Extremely Unprofessional! Sueing for sure!! Stand with me!
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Do not travel with Delta,We are traveling with toddler from Boston to Bozeman with layover in Minneapolis. Our flight was scheduled at 8:05 AM in morning to Minneapolis and arrived at airport at 6:30 AM. Since it was an infant seat boarding pass was not getting printed and we had to checkin bags and car seat.The queue at checkin gate was so long and even after requesting multiple times the lady in front of delta checkin gate did not care to accommodate us in anyway. It took for ever as we were probably 100th person waiting to check in. With the rate things were moving we again requested her and see if she could help us NO. Eventually we checked in but it was already 7:35 and with toddler we still rushed to get security. There was a backlog even there and finally we went to gate at 7:55 am and they had closed the gate. So we missed the flight. We thought we will wait and see next available options.We got a connecting flight to SLC and then to Bozeman. But SLC flight was already delayed and we had to wait for 12 hours in Boston airport and finally boarded at 6 PM.  We would reach Bozeman at 12:05 AM. So we know car rental is closed and we need an accommodation. The Delta person who made changes to lay over and connecting flight told they took care of accommodation for overnight in Bozeman and to collect which hotel info directly in Bozeman and we trusted blindly.We finally reached SLC and we wanted to confirm hotel in Bozeman but the queue was so long again we did not get to talk to delta representative as we were running late to next flight.We landed in Bozeman and the ground Delta representative in Bozeman told there was no communication for them to book hotels for us and weekend are pretty busy in summer and she flat out told everything will be booked. Then at 12:30 AM we called atleast 25 hotels to see if there was any availability but None and it was too late to book. There is no car rental no hotel and with a baby. Finally at 1:30 AM we decided we will sleep in Bozeman airport since it was a long day. And finally delta representative provided some bed sheet since we had a baby.I am not going to chose Delta because they cannot book a full flight to make money and not have staff to help us. They just are overbooked and probably current staff is overworked and they just do not care about customer.
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Delta changed our flights without contacting us,Do not travel with delta. They will change your flights without calling you and then when you call the hold time is over 2 hours. I called and was on hold over 2 hours then their phone call dropped. I ha e tried is it their text message system with no help reaching a customer service rep. I ha e also used instant messenger on Facebook and no contact from a representative. They changed my 7 year old son’s flight to a new route other than ours.
Date of travel: August 2021,20,Careful when you fly with Delta,Delta made me pay 100 dollars for a bag that was 2 pounds overweight. I was ok with that because my bag contained important items that I received from my baby shower etc. When I arrived at the gate we were told the flight was delayed 45 minutes for cleaning. At this time they were also unloading peoples luggage—luggage that was heavy. They didn’t inform us that they were doing this until many of us arrived in Paris and were not able to pick-up our bags. They arrived 20 minutes later than they informed us . My understanding is that the delay had more to do with an overbooked flight and heavy luggage rather than cleaning. They should have informed the twelve people whose luggage they were unloading from the plane.  I have mo clothes to wear and a bag full of baby items that are waiting to be delivered to me. The customer service rep says they can’t find the delivery address on google map. My in-laws have received mail and packages since they have lived here. They also could not tell me what company they use to deliver the items to us. I am less than impressed with Delta. I wanted to recommend my family fly with them for the wedding next year but now I will not. I also would like to mention that they are not good about regulating people who are wearing actual masks. I am pregnant and the man sitting next to me was coughing the whole flight and wearing a bandana to cover his face.
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Delta Airlines' Service is Horrible,Delta airlines sucks. Their flight attendants touched my person. Horrible. Absolutely horribly mini dictators.
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Delta needs to either fix their web site or hire some people!,"Delta changed my flight schedule form PHX to IDA by hours.  I have been trying to reschedule all day long and have been on hold for hours and have no one pick up, have been trying to message, also for hours and have had no humans respond.  Due to it being a flight reschedule, the online portal say s I need to discuss with a representative.  This is Delta's fault and they basically are just saying take the new flight, we are busy, we can't get people so tough luck.  I am going to find a new airline!"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,"If I could give 0 stars, I would. Might as well fly Spirit for a third of the cost with Delta’s less than subpar service","1 Delta Booked OVERLAPPING connecting flights. Our first flight from our destination origin to Atlanta landed AFTER the Atlanta to Costa Rica flight began boarding.We couldn’t get to our connecting flight because Delta booked our first flight that was set to land at 9:20. Our second flight’s boarding started at 8:50. THIRTY MINUTES before the first plane was scheduled to land. Take-off was 9:45. We asked our flight attendants THREE times if we could deplane early to make it to our connecting flight and they said “No”. Even though, we were promised by multiple Delta agents that the flight attendants would allow us to deplane ahead of the rest of the guests. My travel partner has disability. The Delta flight attendants did not accommodate this.  I then had to fight with the gate agents to allow us on the connecting flight. Then, the cherry on top is delta losing our luggage. We have absolutely no clothes nor do we have my traveling partner’s medications. Oh, and to make it even better?The Delta flight attendants are not enforcing masks on the plane, when it’s a federal mandate. If you want to travel Delta, be prepared to get Covid. The Delta flight attendants won’t enforce the mask mandates and there were many guests walking up & down the aisle of the plane without their mask on. After seeing the way Delta handled COVID at the height of the pandemic, I swore I’d only fly Delta from here on out. However, this experience has entirely ruined our trip. We are left without my travel partner’s medication. Delta customer service is horrid. They will not respond and I have been on 3-hour holds multiple times. I DO NOT RECOMMEND and will be canceling my Delta American Express card."
Date of travel: August 2021,50,Saved the Day,My husband and I did not get our Covid results back in time before our flight. Delta airlines went above and beyond to get us out on the next flight home at no extra cost. They gave us seats with extra leg room and found a way to seat my husband and I together. Very efficient and sympathetic. Will definitely fly with Delta Airlines again. Thank you.
Date of travel: August 2021,10,"Itinerary changes, overbooked flights, bad customer service","Experience started by Delta significantly changing the purchased itinerary, moving up flight time by 5 hours and adding an additional layover.  One of the flights was overbooked, resulting in a delay in departure, leading to a missed connection, which lead to an overnight stay.  I was generally disappointed with the Delta employees I met along the way, while some were genuinely trying to help many others were condescending and didn't care at all."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Poor customer service,"My wife wanted to upgrade our seats and found the price to be reasonable- $117. We were on separate reservations because I booked some of the trip with miles and paid for the rest. She successfully upgraded her seat and when she went to do mine the price had jumped to $300. We had no choice at that time to purchase it then figured we’d call customer service to see what happened. Getting someone on the phone is daunting. I called at 9 am and was told to leave a callback # and get a call back in 2 hrs. Well, 5 hrs later I got my call. They told me that once she booked her seat for the cheaper price, the system immediately raised the price of the other seat. He said it was supply and demand and that since I bought the seat there was nothing he could do. He said I shouldn’t have bought the seat and call Delta, which is crazy because you can’t get anyone to answer. He made me feel as if I should have known the price jump would happen and it was my fault. All I wanted was to pay the same price as my wife. Extenuating circumstances put us on 2 different reservations this time, if they gave me a credit for the difference I would’ve been happy. They will not work with you. I was planning to use Delta primarily for the few times I fly each year, but no more. I was a little frustrated with JetBlue mostly because of delays, but their customer service was good. The couple of issues I had over the years, they always tried to understand and work something out. If this is the way Delta treats it’s customers, then I’ll fly with someone who cares about its customers"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Delta airlines reservation system is broken!,"I have been trying to cancel a flight for weeks. Unsuccessfully. Weather via their app, or logging in via a browser window to their website, I have been unsuccessful in canceling your flight, because after entering in all the correct information, It says “We are sorry, we are unable to process your request. Please try back at another time.“ I’ve been making screenshots of that response for at least a month. Meanwhile, due to them laying off their telephone support workers, like most other airlines and businesses (blaming it on Covid, of course!), when you try to call it tells you that there is a wait, and they even give you a time. Yesterday it was 7 1/2 hours (!), Today is Amir five hours and 20 minutes. Really? Really?! Somebody will wait online to make a reservation or cancel the reservation that long? I should check to see what’s happening with their stock price!"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Awful experience,"I called and verified the pets before flight. After two agents confirmed that I could fly with the dogs, I purchased pets for 2400€ and bought two cabin kennels for 100€ each. At the airport, the check in lady and her manager told me that I was good to fly. I got on the plane and was preparing to take off from Frankfurt to Atlanta then Atlanta to Dallas. During final check, I was told that me, my wife and my four kids had to vacate the flight. After leaving the plane, I was told that I should have researched the requirements although four separate Delta employees stated that I was good to fly. A Delta employee, Elizabeth, giving hotel vouchers was rude and walked away without answering questions about how to get to the hotel and if I would receive refunds on the two pet fees that I paid that morning. Although the supervisor, Olivia, said tomorrow’s flight is full, she told us to come back tomorrow and she will get us booked to fly without the dogs. My family and I were left outside the airport with no way to hotel for four hours until a shuttle came. We are currently sitting in the hotel without any confirmations or reservations hoping that Delta will get us a flight after several employees gave us bad information leading up to this situation.I was told to call a pet service to have the dogs flown back separately, but the price of this service is 2200€. This is completely unacceptable. My kids are going to miss the first few days of school. My wife is going to miss her cancer treatments, and very possibly her job due to this situation and not being back at work on time. The employees at Frankfurt airport were no help at all."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,First class is not really first class,"Bought a first class ticket for over $2,000. No pillow or blanket provided. The food was in a cardboard box, which was basically a few nuts and pretzels. Not sure what the difference between first and economy. Very disappointed, will not be traveling Delta will switch over to Jet Blue instead."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Vacation,Staff at the gate are rude when you ask them a question. I never flight delta and I was confused about the seat assignment I asked the lady at the gate and she just screamed and told me to take my seat. I proceeded to ask her again and she completely ignored me and the people waiting behind me.  You do not know your seat number until you check in to go inside the plane. I am am very confusing. Most of the people complaining at the gate
Date of travel: July 2021,50,An Act of Kindness,"Planning to eat breakfast at the airport (as I had done on previous years on this flight originating in Cincinnati), I was surprised that the lines for food were incredibly long -- preventing me from eating a meal before boarding. I hoped I could have better luck in Atlanta, but again the lines were too long to allow me to pick up food before boarding the next flight of 3+ hours. When I boarded the plane, I asked the flight attendant if I could purchase a meal because I have TYPE 1 DIABETES; she indicated that there was no meal service on the flight. She asked where I was seated.Shortly thereafter she approached me with a brown bag and GAVE ME HER LUNCH!  What a difference that made in my well-being  -- I needed a meal--not just a snack.

Date of travel: August 2021,10,Long delay without compensation,"Flight from Seatac to MSP was delayed over 8 hours for mechanical reasons.  Every hour or two, would get notification that the flight was delayed another hour or two.  I missed my connection in MSP and, because of that, was unable to get my rental car the next day (no cars available due to car shortage, they cancel your reservation if you don't pick up car within a certain number of hours).  Airline did not offer any food voucher in Seatac.  They did put out small tray of tiny bags of cookies or Cheez-its after over 6 hours.  The gate agent in Seatac was the only positive experience - Tomoko helped so many people rearrange their flight plans and even stayed beyond her shift to make sure everyone was taken care of.  We were reassured that hotels should be covered in MSP given late hour of arrival, missing connections, cause of delay was mechanical failure.  However, after waiting in 2 long lines in MSP late at night, we were told that no hotel rooms were available (which turned out to be BS because I spoke with another passenger while waiting for a hotel shuttle, who arrived after I did - she missed her connection and said Delta was putting her up in a hotel) and that arrangements and costs were on us.  All they offered was a $100 travel voucher, which was much less than the cost of any available hotel that I could find. On the flight itself, we only got one beverage service and were offered a tiny bag of almonds or the usual biscotti cookies.  You would think that after that long wait, they would give you at least a bag of chips/cookies and two beverage services, which other airlines do on that leg as a routine.In short, I know mechanical problems can happen, but Delta really did nothing to make the passengers more comfortable or feel like they were remotely important."

Date of travel: August 2021,10,First Class cost but not First Class Service!,"I am currently on a Delta flight from Tampa to Seattle traveling “First Class” at least that is what I paid for. What a disappointment! There is extra legroom and power at the seats but there is a wide divider between the two seats which makes getting in and out difficult AND I am a tiny woman (5 foot tall 100 lbs). The flight left at 9 and is 5 hours so I expected so substantial food. For breakfast ? I had 2 pieces of banana bread, a dollop of yogurt and 4 blueberries. After 4 hours into the flight I asked if we would get another meal - no snacks. So Jet Blue type snacks were offered out of a basket. I know it’s a pandemic but what did I pay for?"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Worst service ever,"These people suck, DO NOT USE DELTA!!!!!!! The plane land and we have to wait for 40 min to get off, the staff is rude amd very inconsiderate to everyone the whole flight and then we have to wait an hour for our bags to come out on the carousel they had the whole plane waiting for an hour for bags to come, like what are you doing. I will never fly delta again"
Date of travel: August 2021,50,Delta Stands Above The Rest,"Delta Airlines is coming through the Pandemic even stronger and better than before.   With flights on all airlines starting to fill up again, Delta makes sure that passengers are comfortable about sanitary precautions, without compromising the other aspects of travel.As was always the case, Delta flights are on time (Even though we had a departure delay in NY, we still arrived in Rome as scheduled.  Our return flight actually arrived early.).   Ben and Jerry's was a real treat for dessert on the way over to Europe and the food on the return trip was particularly and surprisingly good.  All staff was courteous, helpful and attentive, even in the less favored seating areas.  All in all, Delta continues to earn our respect and trust.  Welcome back."

Date of travel: August 2021,50,Flight attendant Michael is amazing!,"On our flight from FWA to MSP on 8/12/21 our flight attendant just made such an impact on us. He is a true blessing to Delta and I hope they appreciate him!!  We had a mechanical delay which is not anyone’s fault but is always a bummer, but he just kept everything running so smoothly, offering water, just being friendly and funny and personable. He walked through helping people know where their next gate was and how long their layover was. When we were nearing the end of our flight he asked us to allow those that had close connecting flights to let them off first and he called their gates trying to hold the flights for them. Michael went above and beyond for those on our flight and he is such an attribute to Delta!!"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Horrible airline,Crappy plane.  Delay after delay with no explanation. Windows can not be seen out of they are so fogged up. Chair would not recline. CEO is a Marxist.

My husband and I were traveling to Cancun for our honeymoon, and we were running late. Stephen did everything to try to help us get on the plane. We ended up having to take the next flight, but we made it. Stephen made multiple attempts and tried different methods to get us to board (he went above and beyond). We tried to tip him to show our gratitude and he didn't want to accept. He was very patient and kind. I am not one to write a review, but Stephen deserves to be recognized. We had a great time, and it was all thanks to Stephen Serrano. Location-IAH (Ticketing area)"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Unaccompanied Minor,"Shame on you Delta Air Lines, I paid for my minor to fly across the country with an unaccompanied minor fee associated with his ticket meaning that he was supposed to be taken care of on a 5+ hour flight. How is it when a child asks for a blanket, he was told ""they are for first class only?"" Not to mention at JFK your staff does not know how to communicate that after 12 am Terminal B is closed and if you are picking up your minor child that you have to drive to Terminal C and pay for parking twice!"
Date of travel: August 2021,20,"Bad website programming, horrific wait times on hold","Not sure why Delta can't have your flight information at your fingertips once you've logged into their account, like other airlines. And then the website tells you the information you've entered is incorrect when it isn't. Am cursing myself for recently getting a Delta Skymiles credit card and having to deal with Delta again, after avoiding them for years."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,My worst-ever experience with an airline,"1. On Aug 1, 2021, I booked a flight to travel from DFW to YYC for Friday, October 8, 2021 (DL1517 to SLC, and DL1048 to YYC),2. Delta cancelled those flights, 3. As of the time of this writing (Aug 10), Delta flights DL1662, DL2964 is available for DFW to YYC for Oct 8, but instead of putting me on that flight, Delta chose to automatically rebook me on a flight that was 3 times as long, and even worse still, for travel on Sunday, October 10, 2021!4. Delta did not even bother to send me an email indicating me that the flights were cancelled and I had been rebooked. I just happen to go to the app to discover this change,5. I immediately went to delta.com to attempt to cancel the new flight, and could not. The website redirected to call customer service on 1800-221-1212.6. I called that number on Aug 10 at 11am, and was told by the voice prompt that the wait was 5 hours. Of course I disconnected the call6. I called back at 6pm same day (today), and I am still waiting to speak to a rep after been on the call for 45 minutes.Based on the above, it is obvious to me that Delta does not care about their customers. All the reward point they give away in their attempt to pay for for loyalty would have been better spent investing in good customer service. I have told all my family  members of this terrible experience with Delta, and will continue to tell everyone interested in listening to me of just how terrible this Airline is. So buyer beware!"
Date of travel: July 2021,20,Not What They Used To Be,"I have flown Delta for many years.   Not far enough for anything other than Silver Medallion status, but I generally buy first class tickets for the comfort and convenience.  My husband owns a business and flys long distances with the distance totals earning him Gold Medallion status, but the trip durations are months at a time, so he makes roughly 3-4 international trips annually.  We used to buy the Delta Club access for him, but I was unable to use it without traveling with him (I occasiinally visit him) so I opened an American Express account so that I could pay to use the club when I traveled alone.  That was wonderful until months after opening the account, they discontinued that benefit so I closed the account.  Now the Club only allows Delta One Members which is disappointing to say the least. I  still fly first class, but I've begun to notice the lack of little things. At Prioriry Check-In there were only two representatives working the counter and just as many people waiting in line as the general lines, no more water waiting at your seat when you arrive, no service before taking off, no more complimentary  ""higher speed' access, no more glassware or gourmet meals.  Even the snack selections are dwindling.  I was offered the same two snack boxes 4 times.  The only benefit I see to flying first class anymore is no luggage fee, priority access to the TSA Security lines and priority boarding.  Now many airports offer appointment security check-in options and airlines are out pricing Delta.  It is disappointing to see the service I have come to use and love going away.  I hope things change soon before I have to change carriers and reestablish myself."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Time on hold -- CRAZY,"I just spent 3:00:48 on hold just for someone to say ""let me get you to a trained person"".Just is outragous!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,NEVER AGAIN,"Delta is a horrible company, I am shocked of the horrible service I have been facing this past years, as a Skymiles medallion member and as a non rev, the services is unacceptable and embarrassing. The worst part of all of this is that there is noneone to speak to about this. And you keep doing that to your own employees and your customers what an embarrassment"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Can't change a flight - via website or phone,"I have an upcoming trip with Delta that has been rescheduled by Delta. As a result, I am trying to change my flights - allowed with the ticket I purchased. I have tried online where I received the message to that effect of 'uh oh something unexpected happened' and I've waited on the phone for almost 8 hours today. I did get to hear their representative answer only to have the call disconnected. (Coincidence?!?)My wait time was estimated for each call at less than 2 hours. The first call took 2h 38m to connect. The second has yet to connect at just under 5h of wait time.If this is what it takes to try to (re)schedule a flight - I don't even want to imagine what my experience flying will be. I've NEVER had this service with Delta and have been a loyal customer. I won't say this is my last trip as my options are usually limited - but I will NOT be loyal to Delta any more, that is for sure.If you can't reschedule flights via phone or the website, what else is there??!? I keep getting a message that cycles through on how Delta values its customers and is taking all these measures to keep them safe - I'd like to just be able to CONTACT them successfully in a reasonable amount of time - or online - and rearrange my travel plans that THEY rearranged first."
Date of travel: August 2021,40,On Time & Great Flights,"I flew with Delta Air Lines for my recent vacation. I flew to Boise from BWI and then back to BWI 8 days later. Both times, we had a layover in Atlanta. All the flights took off on time and landed on time. The inflight entertainment was great with new 2021 movies, live TV, and TV shows. It worked well on all the flights except the last plane which had an older, smaller screen that did not work well when you touched it and the headphone jack did not work well either. They offer a small snack on all the flights. My husband and I sat next to each other on all the flights without paying a dime extra for a seat upgrade. The big negatives were that TV and headphone jack on the last flight, and on one of the flights, they announced mid-boarding that everyone remaining with a roller bag had to put it under the airplane - several overhead bins ended up being empty."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,The most stressful flight.,"Seat and flying time changes more than 10x, not to consider the entertainment doesn’t work for two long flights that I took. 4hrs customer service wait. Its ok if Im by my self, Im with my family, four travelers. every time they change aircraft they change our seat and we are all separated. I’ve waited 4hrs to talk to customer service so that our seating arrangement will be good. And the covid precaution this airlines is talking about is not true. They will packed the plane then serve you with gold fish cracker (seattle to hawaii)."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Don't fly Delta,"I just flew Delta today and the crew was extremely rude, threatening to kick people of the flight without bothering to ask politely yo comply with the rules.And there phone system is totally of the hook I called several times and was transferred directly to the survey and when I did finally reach the que they told It's a 20 minute hold but it actually took an hour and a half until someone answered."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,You have a connecting flight?  Too bad,"First off, I would like to start this with a positive.  I appreciated the cleanliness efforts including the wipes for each passenger that was handed out.  I always bring my own even before Covid, so it is certainly appreciated.  Now onto the not so good.  My husband and I flew with you guys back in May from Mexico and it was a less than stellar experience.  Boarding was a big cluster of a mess and I was not allowed to board with my husband, who was seated next to me.  Fast forward to this past week's experience.  My Mom had two heart attacks unexpectedly and we had to fly at the last minute.  Now typically we choose to fly with Alaska but they did not have an itinerary that would work for the day I needed to depart.  So, I decided to give Delta another shot because I believe one not so great experience does not mean they all will be.  This is a choice I soon regretted.  We had an afternoon flight out of Seattle and boarding began late.  I knew we had a tight connection in Salt Lake (it was somewhere in the ballpark of 30ish minutes).  I approached the desk and asked if we were leaving on time and she said no.  I inquired if I would have time to make my connection and she said that we'd be landing on time despite leaving late and that I should be fine once she checked the flight.  I was skeptical but believed her- it's her job and she does this all the time, right?We take off almost 30 minutes late.  I am starting to not be certain we will make it but I sit back and trust the system.  We landed and came to find out (my party was seated in the back of the plane) that almost all of the passengers around me had 30ish minutes to make their connections too.  Now over the speakers we hear something to the tune of if you miss your connection, go to the help desk.  I balk at this.  It would be very simple to tell the passengers to stay seated and let the people who have tight connections off first, since this was your airline's fault and not the fault of the passengers.  This did not happen.  Seems to me that it would save everyone a lot of trouble... including the help desk who would have to deal with upset customers.  But hey, I guess I am wrong.  We run once the crowd breaks and this would have been fine because the gate was only a few gates away.  We get there and the walkway is still extended but no one is at the desk.  I panic... don't forget... my mother is in the hospital... on a ventilator after her heart attacks.  I run over to the next desk and she is kind enough to call someone which was for nothing as I turn around I see the walkway retracting.  What ensued was my husband trying to keep me from having a full on meltdown.  After I was calm he told me that a gate agent finally showed up and called him a liar that we were not there before the walkway retracted.  Great customer service, let me tell you.  We hurriedly made our way to the help desk.  My husband has to end up dealing with it because I am so upset.  We were given a few options and finally settled on taking a midnight flight to Atlanta and then from Atlanta to my final destination at San Antonio.  There was no guarantee that my husband could even be on the last leg of the flight with my daughter and I.  We had to just hope.Flight to Atlanta went off fine with little to no sleep.  I ended up resting a little at the airport but was utterly exhausted and still had a full day ahead of me.   My husband was on the standby as the first person and once I boarded with my daughter we just held our breath in hope that he would get on.  We were the last passengers on the plane that weren't ticketed.  After that another 6 or 7 people were boarded even though my husband was right at the gate and assured by the desk he would be first standby.  More great customer service.  I don't mind not being number one but I sure do mind being lied to.  Luckily, he was able to get on and we made it to San Antonio together, albeit with a very bad taste in our mouth from our experience.  We arrived back home last night and I was waiting till I had time to write this and be able to articulate it without coming off as completely nasty.  Want to know the irony of this?  We flew Alaska home- a direct flight.  As we landed I was still listening to music and out of the corner of my eye I saw my family laughing.  I removed my earbud and asked what.  Can you guess?  There were 6 people on the back of the plane that had connecting flights in Seattle.... the crew asked that the whole plane stay seated to allow those passengers off first.  I just had to shake my head.  That's how it's done.  That's how you take care of your customers and keep them coming back.  As I deplaned I stopped at the front to thank the crew for doing that for them.  And this is why I will always fly Alaska whenever possible.  Top tier service and thoughtfulness for not only their passengers time but the well being of their employees not having to deal with upset customers who missed a flight due to their own company.  In the future when they are not available I will seek out all other options before Delta.(Oh and none of the charging ports worked except one in my daughter’s seat on the three planes we were on… thank goodness for the battery saving power of plane mode and airport charging.)"
Date of travel: July 2021,40,"Recent Trip to Orlando, Florida","My family and I just took a trip to Disney World in Florida. We flew out of LaGuardia in New York on Delta. I'm a Delta SkyMiles member, and have been for about 20 years. My wife and I have flown Delta many times with both ups and downs. I was particularly worried this time because of all of the problems the pandemic has wrought upon the airline industry. My uneasiness increased when about an 1 1/2 hours before our flight was scheduled to board I received a text that our flight was being delayed for about 2 1/2 hours. We were traveling with our daughter, her husband and three grandchildren and I had terrible visions of the flight being cancelled (ala Spirit, American etc) and trying to re-book seven tickets. About a 1/2 hour into the delay a Delta representative came to the gate and let everyone know that the fight was delayed because of problems with the plane and that they were flying in another plane  from Atlanta. Kuddos to Delta for letting us know the reason for the delay and what they were doing to get us to our destination. Passengers at a minimum want to be kept informed of what is going on with their flights and why their flights are delayed and/or cancelled. It was great to see that done in this instance. A few years ago, on a Delta  flight  from Orlando to New York our flight was was delayed multiple times for over 6 hours until it was ultimately cancelled at about 12:30 am. No one from Delta ever told us anything and we ended up sleeping in the airport while we waited for our re-booked flight. The main reason for this review is that we wanted to commend the entire flight crew and in particular one of their members; Shira (did not get her last name). I've been flying for over 40 years and never met such a pleasant and friendly flight attendant. Given all that is going on with the pandemic, delayed & cancelled flights, rude & aggressive passengers etc., it was truly a pleasure seeing someone who actually appeared to be happy at work. It was a pleasure meeting her and the rest of the flight crew. They all did a great job and we hope to see them all again on our next flight."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Injustice,"Our first Delta flight was delayed and as a result we landed at 9:15pm and missed our next scheduled flight at 9:25pm from Detroit to Las Vegas. Delta moved our flight to 7:00a.m. the next morning. We had already booked a non-refundable hotel in Vegas that night and had nowhere to stay in Detroit. Customer service gave us $100.00 dollar vouchers and told us they could be used at a hotel. When we arrived at a hotel that was Recommended by their staff the hotel told us the vouchers were no good. Come to find out the vouchers were only valid for a discount on our next flight. Exhausted, stressed, and down money before we even got to Vegas; Delta has treated me and my friends unfairly."

I never reached a rep on phone.Emailed Delta regarding attempts to change flight. It took over 30 days for a response informing me nothing could be done until AFTER my trip dates.I then tried canceling flight. Website would not allow cancellation and oops! so sorry you are out 17,000 earned SkyMiles.Additionally, I purchased travel insurance through Delta partner Allianz and emailed them to see if my policy covered loss. I never received any response from Allianz!I have continued attempting to resolve issue (CEO Ed Bastian recently emailed customers with news about new e-credits and refunds) but to date no one at Delta has responded.I am pleased to write I have booked two flights to NC on Sun Country Airlines for August alone and am looking forward to monthly flights for the foreseeable future on Sun Country Airlines.Thank you Sun Country for making a miserable Delta fail less intolerable!"
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Johanna is a Nazi,"Bad experience in first class. I am pretty good about wearing a mask at all times but I think this particular flight attendant took it a little too far with me. We were given waters to drink and I took a drink and was talking to my wife and Johanna came by and reminded me to put my mask back on in between sips. A little strict and nonsensical for my blood, but fair enough. About an hour later I was eating my pretzels and just trying to relax and I just noticed Johanna was walking down the aisle again so I quickly pulled my mask back on to show her I was trying to abide by the rules. She rather abruptly and rudely came up to me and said that this was the third time (not true) that she has had to tell me to put my mask back on and that if she saw me with it down again we would be put on a list, barring me from flying with Delta again... I get they need to enforce these rules but I was not being out of line at all and was trying to go out of my way to follow these rules. Nevertheless I just shut my eyes the rest of the flight and tried not to interact with her again. Not a good experience especially for how expensive those tickets were. Let's all just try to be nice to each other again and have some common sense. That is all. Love, Casey"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Worst flight l have ever had,"It was a terrible experience to fly with Delta airlines. It was my first time from Hawai to Seattle, it got delayed more than 2 hours.

Date of travel: July 2021,10,Like traveling on a greyhound bus,"Horrible.  We purchased First class tickets because it was a long flight and I thought it would be fun for my teenaged daughters to sit in First Class for the first time.  I was wrong.  The Delta Website says they have hot food service on long flights in first class so I told my family not to eat before we boarded, it was a morning flight at 9:00am.  We got on board and were seated directly to a baby who was already screaming when we sat down.  There was no food service just a ""snack box"" that you can purchase in coach for $7.  The ""premium"" snacks were tiny bags of goldfish crackers and pretzels.  The lap baby next to us screamed for 4 straight hours with her parents unable to console her and the father who was seated two rows in front of the mother, toddler, and their 6 year old constantly coming back and bending over in the isle with his rear end in our faces during the entire trip.  Couldn't rest with the screaming, received no food service, were told there were no pillows or blankets.  Not worth the additional $600+ dollars per ticket we spent.  Called Delta to complain and was given  the most rude CS rep I have ever encountered and told basically ""too bad theres nothing we can do"".  I will never fly Delta again and suggest if you do and are thinking of upgrading your seat, don't waste your money."

Date of travel: August 2021,20,"Changing flights not intuitive, and then I didn't get the seat I paid for!","I had a great deal of difficulty changing flights online. I don't think the process is intuitive. When you choose another flight, a price is listed, but a passenger typically would think this was an additional cost. Nowhere (that I could find) is the amount of credit from the original ticket shown. (This did eventually come up, but not until I'd taken a chance and clicked on a fare). Also, I couldn't find a way to exit without choosing seats...and therein lies the rub.There were two passengers on the itinerary. I captured the one available seat ""at no extra charge,"" but then the only remaining seats had a $30 up-charge. Since I recently spent 2-1/2 hours on hold with Delta (and never got through), I paid up. Then, we arrived at the airport. The seat reservations had been canceled and we were reassigned seats. The good news--they were together. The bad news--neither seat was a Comfort Plus, for which I'd paid $30 extra. I asked the gate agent and he said they were both Comfort Plus. (He lied). As soon as we boarded, it was obvious they were not premium seats. I asked the flight attendant and she confirmed they weren't Comfort Plus. She said she would check with the gate agent...and that's the last we saw of her for the entire trip. I don't really blame her, because every seat on the flight was filled. However, changing the flight and then reassigning seats were both done by computer, and Delta could easily fix both.I'm aware that I can ask Delta to refund the $30, but with all of the issues I experienced, I'm not going to bother. They will only issue e-refunds (with an expiration date) and I have no plans to go anywhere that Delta flies. I wouldn't even have flown Delta this time (because of their woke policies) if I'd had any other reasonable choice...but that's a whole 'nother story. I'm not saying I'll never fly Delta again, but given a choice...I won't."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Terrible,This was probably the worst experience flying I have ever had in my life. The flight attendants were on a power trip trying to be the next famous person on twitter. I would rather take my chances with spirit then ever fly delta again.

Ive always flown delta but will consider using other airlines. Our flight was direct and paid direct flight cost, Delta changed our flight to a connecting flight without explanation and added 5 hours to the entire trip going four hours out of the way. Hating this and trying to remain pain dealing with the stupidity of their customer service. I know this won't even do anything and delta won't even see this but if other people see it I hope it helps you decide on what airline to choose. Good luck!"

Anyway, i decided to help them out and checked 2 of my bags that would have been carry-ons(free of charge). 180 people boarding takes time. 5 planes on the tarmac takes time. 180 people deplaning takes time.

The first 3 or 4 connecting cities left in less that 10 minutes. The door wasnt even open yet. Another 5 down the list i finally hear mine called out along with the gate ""you have 27 minutes"". 10 minutes later we finally were able to step off of the plane. Boarding ends 15min before departure...Regardless, we sprinted through 2 terminals to arrive, covered in sweat, at the gate we were given(was not on departure screen for some reason...?) Just to find out the attendant gave us the wrong gate, and our plane had already left.(explains the screen) our bags were on that plane. I went to customer service, who was not at all thrilled to help me. They told me to call the 24/7 service number. Like arent they there to help me in person???? The soonest flight they could put me on was 6 hours later. I went over to southwest to ask for seat but with delta refusing any non-voucher reimbursement, i was stuck with the 11 pm departure as opposed to my original 530pm arrival time. With nothing but the clothes on my back. Every customer service member i spoke to gave me another number to call, and the last one had me on hold for over an hour, luckily i had the time. Overall just absolutely terrible time management, employess working the gate have zero sense of urgency, but the attendants and pilots seemed genuinely apologetic about the situation even though it was out of their control. I would rather drive cross country in a Neon than fly with them again."
Date of travel: July 2021,50,Great Job Delta,"I traveled to Mississippi to see my Dad for the last time, he has terminal Cancer and is on Hospice. Not 1 problem on my flights there and on my flights back home. From dropping off my bags to arriving at my destination, I did not encounter 1 problem. All of the Delta Agents at the bag drop area, Gate Agents, Flight Attendants, and Pilots were extremely polite and caring. All of my flights were on time and we arrived at each Airport earlier than expected. All the passengers were quiet and compliant with the Mask Mandate. Not 1 person had to be reminded about their mask. Thank you Delta!!The only complaint I have is you need to hire more people to answer the phone when someone has a problem and they need to call to talk to a human in order to get their problem fixed. No one is going to stay on hold for 6 hours+. Please do something about that!!I read all the reviews on here. Most of them are bad reviews. A few are good. I believe most people have good experiences with Delta. A lot of people don't even think about writing a review unless something goes wrong and things don't go their way. I believe that's the reason why there are only a few good reviews and a ton of bad reviews. And it's the same way with most of other Airlines as well, if you take a look at their reviews. So I thought I'd share my positive review. A lot of people say don't fly with Delta, fly with United or American, Southwest or Spirit. You go on their review sites and people are saying the same thing ""Don't fly with Southwest or United, fly with Delta!!!"" It gets very confusing sometimes. But Delta, you are #1!! Hire more Customer Service Reps though"
Date of travel: August 2021,30,Seat Changes Separate Me From Family,"I booked travel to Hawai’i using Delta  credits from cancelled COVID flights.  I was unable to use the credits to purchase the tickets together in one itinerary.  I’m told there is a way and tried multiple times unsuccessfully.  So the flights were booked separately.  Shortly thereafter, seat changes separated me and my husband for the inbound flight.  I waited on hold 3 hours to speak to a rep who couldn’t undo the change or reassign us to seats together, but she said she “linked the itineraries” so this would not reoccur with the other leg of our travel.  Guess what, it did!!   We were separated again on the return flight. Three hours on hold for nothing, nada, zip.  I am not a happy first class customer.  I will still use Delta as they are mostly a quality airline but I wrote this as a cautionary tale for others.  Purchase tickets together in one itinerary  whenever possible.  Delta can  still change your seat (their right) but it is much less likely."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,6 hours on hold - 3 hours Friday and 3 hours today w/o an answer,I have not flown on Delta for a while and I guess I will avoid them in the future now. There is no excuse for them to have customers on hold over 6 hours or even 3 hours.  I know even the discount airlines do better than that.   I sent in online Friday for my profile name to be updated.  They have my middle initial in my first name and TSA mentioned it last time but I could not get it updated yet.  I'm worried I can't use my new TSA preCheck and TSA might hassle me again.
Date of travel: August 2021,50,Wonderful Customer Service,"We checked our bags in at the ticket counter with a newer agent who wasn't quite sure where we were headed, he was friendly and relatively helpful but told us that we would need to check with our other airline about checking our bags through to Alaska (our final destination).  We were a little uneasy when he said that we'd need to find our bags between flights in Minneapolis but we took it at face value and walked on checking out other flight times.   After double checking our flights we realized we would only have 45 minutes in Minneapolis to grab our bags and recheck them.  We promptly made it to our gate (a8) and checked in with the workers there.  Cindy was extremely helpful and even when she was about to go on break, she decided to walk our baggage information down to the correct people and make a few calls to make sure our bags were getting to where they needed to be.  We haven't even left St. Louis, but I feel confident in their skills and their positive attitude to make sure our experience is as stress free as possible. Thank you to Cindy at St. Louis Delta!"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Terrible airline service,"Terrible service-- unable to staff planes resulting in serial delays, deliberate obfuscation of flight status, staff confrontational and abusive of passengers, unwilling to work with customers on rescheduling, hotel accommodations, food options and travel vouchers. Only reliability is treating people horribly"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Making a TWO YEAR OLD sit without her parents,"Delta changed our flights last minute, messing up our schedule, so we called delta to change our flights. The representative that changed them gave us a flight with a 54 minute layover saying it would be easy to make our connection without telling us he put us in the very back row of the plane and that we had two very far gates from each other. No one would assist us to make our connection easier. My biggest complaint is that they put my TWO YEAR OLD in a row by herself, without me or my husband with my husband and I also in separate rows. They would not change her seat, saying that's how they were automatically assigned. This is very very unsafe to have a two year old next to strangers and also very upsetting to everyone in the seats around us. We shouldn't have to rely on someone us to give up their seats so we can sit with our two year old! I will be looking into laws and regulations on this and filing a complaint wherever I can about this action."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Awful exchange experience,I bought a first class ticket on flight from NYC to Norfolk on August 10th. But due to emergency I exchange tickets to fly from NYC on August 6th. I paid $60 extra to change the date and was seated on the last row next to the toilet!!! Originally my seat was in first class and after I paid more I seated almost on the toilet !! I’ll never fly with Delta again!!
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Delta reps Horrible,"The worst ever. I have been a Delta fan for years..everyone will tell you I don't fly with anyone other then Delta. But after my recent trip to Punta Cana I could not believe the flight attendant spazzed out on 2 passengers for asking a question and she walked off the plane refusing to  work the flight and threatened to delay out flight waiting for another attendant to arrive to take her place or they needed to get off the plane! where and what job are you able to do that. No physical threat arguments or aggression other then from the attendant. Per the pilot in his over  35 years of flying he has never experienced anything like this and neither have I. Not to the location rep for Delta vacations at breathless Punta Cana! Felix was absolutely useless, ineffective, unengaged and sluggish , he arrived late for out flight meeting, did not supply the correct info for the covid testing and how to get it done, He advised Us to just show up. Now we did as we were directed to do and guess what??/ it was not correct we had to go thru a whole heck of confusion getting out results thanks to the hotel staff we got it fixed and was able to leave on time.  He was not reachable on departure day we called and the other 3 couples did as well. We spent 2500 bucks for all this mess and I blame DELTA period. Lastly we were told the plane was cleaned and sanitised but my tray table on the flight 1900 and 1919 return flight was dirty with crumbs and balled up tissue in the seat pocket! get it together people. very disappointed"
Date of travel: July 2021,10,The worst airline,Just don't travel with Delta. We flew to Italy and back using this airline and it was the worst experience ever. Use Emirates.
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Bad Empolyee her name Suzan,Bad customer service from the front disk before borders..The Employee her nam SUZAN give me and family the rudest service I ever had ..when I try to explain to her our situation she said” go back to the last line or I will call my manager” and she start talking rude to us..Iam wounding why they hire these people like her bad service
Date of travel: September 2020,30,"crowded seats, no legroom","Not for old, tall, fat guys.  The seats were extremely close.  Delta has even added extra seating in the exit rows.  It apparently is legal and the FAA must approve, but it is scary to think about how crowded and hard it would be to exit an airplane emergency door.  This is greed at it most obvious level.  I wrote Delta about it and they excuse in the name of filling the airplanes.  On a good day, the airplanes are 87% full.  I argue that seats in the emergency exit aisle or wrong.  Send a a letter to Delta opposing this procedure.JLH  age 75"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Terrible Customer Service Wait Time,I waited over 50 minutes to connect with a representative and never connected.  That’s inexcusable - I will not travel this airline unless I have to.
Date of travel: August 2021,10,DO NOT FLY DELTA. UNORGANIZED AND NO CONSIDERATION FOR CUSTOMERS,"To start off I was very upset that when I provided my negative COVID-19 test via email I was told that I would need a print out in order to fly. This caused me to miss my flight and I was forced to purchase another ticket just to make it to my vacation. Upon receiving the printed out negative COVID-19 test I went to go check in as usual again and they did not even check my documents. Therefore wasted my time and caused me to miss a flight that did not need to be missed. That is the start of my issues with Delta I have been on the phone with them the past four days consecutively and will be on hold for 3+ hours never get connected to anyone after being informed it’s a 20 minute wait,  just hung up on. They left my bag in Atlanta after I spoke to a TSA agent and I spoke to a Delta representative who informed me that my bag would be on the plane because I was flying international. Once I realize my bag was not in Jamaica and I tried to fix this issue the representative I got connected with was very rude almost wanted to argue with me over text about my issues with Delta. She kept trying to say my issue should be with the airport and not with Delta but I’m flying Delta Airlines so my issue is with Delta. I’m not the only one who had to go through this. Multiple bags were left with no explanation as to why. I’ve saved my messages with the agent I was connected with because I will be pursuing some type of compensation. This whole experience just let me know that I CAN NEVER FLY WITH DELTA AGAIN. JUST NOT WORTH ALL THE STRUGGLE AND TO BE TREATED BADLY BY THEIR REPRESENTATIVES. It seems like every review in here from just this year 2021 is terrible. And they all say the same thing so just choose any other airline seriously."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Bring your own food and drink,"Oh, you can't... and they close this place down at 9:30 pm.  I couldn't even get chips they were sold out. Couldn't get coffee closed. Couldn't get a beer no servicers. 👎"
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Extreme Masking Pressures on the Vaccinated,"Unlike five other airlines I've flown on since January, Delta is badgering and threatening people like crazy to keep on masks while eating. I masked most of the flight despite being double-vaccinated. A steward admitted to me that this policy, plus refusal to serve meals, is all to protect staff who have chosen not to get vaccinated. I'm personally sick of making further sacrifices to protect the voluntarily unvaccinated, and have never been so poorly treated on an airplane in my life. I have donated all my Delta Skymiles to charity and closed my account, and will never fly Delta again even if my life depended on it. Avoid at all costs."
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Horrible Service,This has been the worst airline experience I’ve ever had. I will never fly with Delta again. The call wait time sucks 9 hour hold only to be hung up on. Reservations changes with no remorse for the customers. Layover for 6 hours traveling from Hawaii to Salt Lake City rather than LAX. The help desk gave my husband a voucher for $15 for the inconvenience. There is no military area to even rest. Please I recommend do not fly Delta!
Date of travel: August 2021,10,Terrible flight service and selection,They changed the boarding time on us and made us run to get to the plane. We get on 1 minute before end of boarding. Yayyyy we made it. We now we sat for an additional 30 minutes on the runway because they were waiting on catering items. Didn't give us no water or drinks while we wait or apologize for changing times multiple times. We could have got food and drinks before we got on the plane if we would have known we would have sat here for this long. Then they want to charge your 2dollars for free Headphones now. I have been on 12 flights last year and 2 this year and never charged for a pair or their cheap free headphones. Delta is getting really bad. You pay over 600 dollars for a flight and you can't even use the TV they put on the seat with paying more and more money. Delta is becoming a scam.
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Incompetence from start to finish,"Flight changed 6 times by Delta, missed connections, destroyed bag, incompetent flight crew and gate personnel with a I don't give a fu%k attitude."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,"Confirmed flight 5 times, refused boarding at gate","We booked tickets in April with vouchers from previously canceled flights on Air France, due to COVID. We received confirmation numbers and seats. We were unable to check in online 24 hours prior to flight so we called to confirm. They said our tickets are good and to Get the passes at the kiosk. The kiosk said to confirm at service desk. We did and they gave us boarding passes and said everything is fine. We go to board and they refuse to board us saying our tickets are invalid. 1 of us had a separate ticket and she boarded seeing our specific seats empty. The manager refused to come and help. They didn’t give us the option to repurchase the seats on this plane so we watched the plane leave without us and with 3 empty seats. HORRIBLE Customer service. We were booked on the last flight out, that we had to pay for AGAIN and put on standby for the earlier flight. They messed up the standby and put the wrong names on the boarding. We just had the 2 of us who they wrongfully names put to the plane on. Then I hopefully was to get a specific seat on the last flight out. They lady she would be back to get me a seat. She never returned. I was not rude. I was polite and did start to cry once, unintentionally. They were horrible and worthless. So many mistakes by DELTA. Delta put us in a corner and forced us to pay twice for our flights or be stuck in Denver and lose all we had paid for in Seattle.  I would never recommend them. No one took responsibility and they made the once in a lifetime trip with my daughters an extremely expensive(because the literally robbed us by making us pay twice) and stressful start, taking away one of the precious days we had together. NEVER FLY DELTA!"
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Delta Lies To Patrons,I can never make it through a Delta flight without them stealing my bag and forcing me to check it in. This time they lied to me and said there was no way my bag would fit in the overhead. I got on the flight and saw that it would clearly fit and that there was plenty of room. I assume they picked me because they didn't want to inconvenience their A class members. Kind of rude. Do yourself a favor; go with Southwest where bags fly free and they don't force you to check in your bag when you don't want to and there's plenty of space.
Date of travel: July 2021,10,WILL NEVER FLY DELTA AGAIN,"To start our DIRECT evening flight was cancelled before we even left.  We were told the only direct flight left 5 hours earlier, essentially taking a full day from our vacation.  When I inquired with the airline about alternatives, they booked us on a flight leaving 2.5 hours earlier but with a 1.5 hour layover in Atlanta.  I was not compensated for the loss of time or direct flight. So basically Delta charged me for a flight they then did not provide.  Not a great start.   Boarding in Key West was chaotic and unorganized. Once we boarded the flight from Key West to Atlanta the family that occupied the two rows in front of us refused to comply with the mask rule, actually laughing at the flight attendants when they were told.  This began before the flight took off so why they were able to remain on the plane is a mystery to me.  The flight attendant basically gave up  once we were in the air, only half-heartedly mentioning it occasionally when they passed in the aisle.  They were out of most beverages and claimed to have no ice which after we asked 3 different flight attendants ,they mysteriously found some in first class. The second leg of the flight was  unremarkable, nothing terrible but nothing note worthy service wise either."
Date of travel: July 2021,30,Standard airline experience,"No social distancing at boarding, kind of cahotic.  Seats are standard, it is time to get better seats for domestic flights.  There is nothing special to highlight."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Terrible custom service,"Delta changed our flight last minute so we couldn't make our transfer that night. They gave us another flight the next day, but made us pay for our hotel and transportation that night. Hotels in Atlanta are not cheap last minute. They've really gone down hill."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,The worst airline,"Delta is one of the worst airlines now the plaines are old,always when you flight with delta in laguardia airport you always going to make it late or not"
Date of travel: July 2021,40,Great flight experience - so so pre-flight expereince,"I was a bit put off with Delta at first. I waited over 6 hours on hold on the phone and never got an answer. When it was time for bed, I had to hang up.  I did message them on social media platforms and received a quick response and a link to a verified text chat. Although I held on the text chat for many hours, when I did get help it was prompt and easy. Holding on text was much better than holding over the phone!The flight itself was great. The plane was clean and on time. They even had entertainment systems at the back of every seat! I would definitely fly delta again."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Untrustworthy Trash,"My last 3 trips with delta have ended with a plane being delayed so long I missed a 3 hour layover window and had to spend the night in an airport, a second trip where they kept changing my intenerary to where I had to cancel my trip completely, and finally again, supposed to leave an hour and a half ago, still sitting on the tarmac. Again I will miss my connecting flight in detriot with no other flights leaving tonight. The best part is delta gives 0 f about my vacation time, the money I spent putting my pets in a kennel, and a hotel room I won't be even f,n sleeping in tonight. Done with deltas garbage, I would avoid them at all costs. Just take your money, inconvenience the f out of you, and are ruining my hard earned vacation. I don't get days or time back, delta....gladly go f yourselves, you've wasted my time and money for the last time."
Date of travel: May 2021,50,On time and no issues,My flight from MEX to MIA was quick and painless - we left on time and even arrived a little early. The return trip was fine as well -- nothing to complain about here.
Date of travel: July 2021,20,First Class isn't anymore,"I normally prefer Delta for my personal and business air travel.  While the humans service is still wonderful, the policies that they use in regards to covid are ridiculous.  First Class isn't first class if you don't receive a true meal.  A box of crappy unhealthy snacks are not a suitable alternative.  If your ticket says a meal, you should get one with real food.  That didn't happen on our flight.  We would have eaten before we got on the plane if we'd have know.  Also there is no need to pass out these awful boxes of junk food.  People are still keeping their masks down to eat and drink for the same amount of time if you had actual food.  Additionally, if the airline is no longer passing out blankets and pillows--they either need to make the cabin warmer or let people know so they can bring their own.  Also Covid is not transmitted by touch.  I believe Delta is just trying to cut cost in the name of health during the time of covid.  And if that's the case then they should cut the cost of first class or give it a different name.  What we experienced was not first class.  The flight attendants are doing a great job, but the money grubbing executives are causing all of this unhappiness when flying."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Waiting over three hours on the phone to get one simple question answered!,"Trying to book a flight to Jackson Hole, WY with gift cards.The pins had been destroyed because of the cheap manner the cards were manufactured.However, the rep on the phone was great, but he referred me to an email address and couldn't help me.So I sat there and waiting over three hours on the telephone to get one simple question answered that took less than 5 minutes.That is really the worst customer service there can be EVER!Who runs a company where the wait times to get a rep are always 3 to 6 hours...Totally idiotic management to the MAX!I'm telling everyone I know to NEVER EVER USE DELTA again...EVER>This problem has been going on for month!Get it fixed.Hire some people....We pay a lot of money for these flights.Spend some of it on your call center!"
Date of travel: July 2021,50,Great Flight Attendant,"Dear Delta:I would like to highly compliment you on one of your flight attendants, Ashley, employee # 089585. She was the first-class flight attendant on DL 820 from SAN-ATL on Wednesday, July 28th.She was attentive, competent, pleasant, helpful, humorous, cheerful, professional and a joy to have on board. Alas, that isn't always the case, so I especially want you to be aware of how good one of your employees is & what a good impression she made for Delta all around. You should have more like her.In short, she made it seem as though she was glad, we were flying Delta and she was happy to serve us, and we in turn I was glad we flew Delta that day. If I had the power, I'd duplicate her & put her on all my flights. Since I don't, I hope you'll forward this email to her manager, and the vice president of personnel."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,No  help ever!,Delta you are a joke!  Heaven forbid you do a call back like other airlines!  Do you even have anyone working customer service?  This is my fifth time attempting being on hold over 3 hours with no response!  Your online system can not help me I am locked out of my Forgot password.  I flew delta this week and went to the club.  They told me I wasn’t locked out and they can’t help me.  A JOKE!!
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Flight delayed for NO GOOD REASON,"Absolutely ridiculous. Our flight was set for 10:32. The flight was first delayed due to them not having a flight attendant available. It was delayed for over an hour (11:46PM). They then proceeded to board everyone on the plane. The pilot came on the speaker saying that now we not only were missing a flight attendant, but also that fuel was low and they needed to dispatch someone out to put fuel for the plane. That took another 45 minutes. Waiting on a plane that hasn’t even taken off yet. This flight is only 1 hour."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Did not fly before and won't switch,My office booked me on Delta as only flight out. Will never fly again. Most chaotic and odd boarding procedure I have ever witnessed and will never fly delta by choice from what I have seen.
Date of travel: July 2021,50,Compared to AA... Delta ROCKS!!,First off.... Four of us were scheduled to fly this past July but due to my in-laws health they were not able to. I contacted Delta via Facebook Messenger and told them of our situation. Within 10 days they refunded (not credited) but refunded our in-laws ticket in full. That right there is great customer service. The planes were cleaned between boarding. You could small the disinfectants when you boarded the plane. Always greeted by friendly flight attendants. We have flown Delta in the past and have never had a bad experience.
Date of travel: July 2021,50,Bill McNeil - Best Employee,"I need to explain how he saved 9 sets of parents and 9 boys' trips. The day before, I don't even remember how we found out, but one of the moms found out our boys can't fly the next day because Unaccompanied Minors can't fly on the last flight of any airline. We were in LA, our boys in Vermont, and we did not know what to do. I called the phone number just for UM and Bill answered. He was so knowledgeable about the actual rule and it pertaining to these times, COVID. He was able to make sure the boys were not flagged and were able to fly home. We can't thank him enough. He was knowledgeable and so patient. We had 9 boys to make sure can come home. Thank You bill!!"

Date of travel: July 2021,10,What a disappointment,"What a piece of trash Delta’s “ first class”  What a waste of money! Lines for check in, no lounge area , super cold in the plane and NO blankets and NO pillows! No food just a louzy snackbox! Tiny tv screen with poor quality, the controls of the seats peeling, 2:20am and the lights of the signs ( wifi and seatbelts ) were soooo bright . A 5 hrs flight  … you f kidding me??? Worst 1st class experience ever!"
Date of travel: July 2021,10,They have no idea how to determine the delay time!!!,"Some parts of their air craft is broken and they announces a delay of 2h30m and as time progress they made it 3h, 3.5h and 6h:30m. They wanted to give hotel at Atlanta but with the additional delay there is no time for hotel. Don't know whether it's a clever way to avoid hotel cost. A horrible experience with a well-known air lines. Name doesn't matter."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Unaccompanied Minor Nightmare,"This company for unaccompanied minor is the worst by far and yet they charge you 150 dollars for it. My daughter had a direct flight from Orange County Ca to Atl Ga and somehow got diverted to another airport and no one contacted me, I was sitting at the airport waiting for her when I got a call from her freaking out cause she landed in another airport and she doesn't know why and no one told me anything. After speaking to a manager in the airport from Delta, she told me that my daughter is fine and to calm down she will get there when she gets there and that the weather was so bad that they couldn't land but all the other planes seem to be landing just fine and there was no rain, no black clouds it was clear as day sun shinning and 95 out. But the weather was so bad they landed somewhere else and then didn't contact her mother ever even after they sat there for 3 hours. On top of that my daughter was on the phone crying and the flight attendant told her to stop crying and that she was fine and freaking out for no reason. Thank god there was a Mom sitting behind her with her kids who stuck up for her and reassured her that it was going to be ok and that she was there if she needed anything. We fly with southwest and pay 50 dollar unaccompanied minor fee and have never had an issue they tell us if they are running late or even when she has had a not direct flight and they land and change planes the flight attendant will text you and let you know all is well. I have contacted them but I just do not want another child and parent to go through this don't fly your unaccompanied minor with Delta."
Date of travel: July 2021,20,Poor customer service,"I booked an affordable non refundable economy flight on Delta but they have changed my itinerary twice within one week.  Several times, I've attempted to contact Delta for making changes to my flight. However, it has become impossible to reach a live agent or have them return my phone callback requests.  To cancel the flights, I have to pay some fees.  They have sent me automatic email twice stating: ""Your upcoming flight was impacted by a scheduling issue that inadvertently moved you to a different flight.""  Delta, I cannot trust you anymore.  Alaska has much better customer service than you by far."
Date of travel: July 2021,50,What more could I say...,"Its about an upcoming trip and this is about customer service....given the requirements and getting back to normal, I want to thank the good people at DELTA for their continued professionalism...we booked months ago, knowing flights would change but did so to get good prices.....not counting but I believe it has changed three times and not much has changed. Coming back from ALASKA and having DELTA ONE on the longest leg of the flight is even better..."
Date of travel: July 2021,40,Poor Choosing of Seats!,Aside of the Extremely Poor way of choosing or Not choosing seats the flight wasn't bad. Good choices of movies and TV series and the service attendants were pleasant and helpful.
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Lack of communication,Flight was cancelled and no one informed us. We had been in the airport over three hours with delays WBS had to find out on the app that the flight was cancelled until tomorrow. I’ve never had this type of experience with Delta.
Date of travel: July 2021,10,No consideration of traveler,"Booked a trip from FLL to PHX.  Original flight was FLL-ATL-PHX.  We booked this along with family and they were booked LIT-ATL-PHX.   We were to be on the same flight from ATL-PHX.  Delta started changed our flights almost immediately with time changes, and then the flight changes began to happen.  We are now booked FLL-JFK-PHX and our family members are LIT-ATL-SLC-PHX.  The bookings also changed our depart time by 3 hours earlier than originally booked.  We are less than 2 weeks from our flight, and the wait time for calling is 7 hrs.  The worst part is they are still selling seats on the original flights we have booked.  I guess they can charge more for those seats than we paid so they are just pushing us to flights that don't get fully booked.  We were seated together and now are spread out all over the plane.  If I can't get this cancelled and refunded it WILL be my LAST trip on Delta."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Awful Customer Service,"I had a flight with delta and needed assistance answering questions so looked online. The online website does not give clear answers, so I proceeded to try to call them for help. When i called it was a 2 hour wait time to speak with a representative. We then tried to move a flight and they tried to charge us more to change it than if we had just booked a whole new flight. This company just tries to take as much of your money as they physically can."
Date of travel: July 2021,20,9 hours on hold to speak to an agent!,9 hours on hold to speak to an agent!  That is a new standard in pathetic customer service.  Covid is no excuse for this.  I have an issue with multiple skymiles accounts I am trying to merge but am unable to.  I give up trying to ever resolve this.
Date of travel: July 2021,10,"Bad employee in ATL, stay off the phone and do your job!!!!!","I miss my flight because one of your Delta airline person do all flights announcement. She didn't do her job, she was so busy talking on the phone. She didn't make any announcements. When I went up ask her about my flight. She told me it was gone, I told her she didn't make any announcements. You need to tell your announcements person to stay off the phone and do there job."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,BEWARE,"I booked my September flight on July 22nd using miles and an ecredit.   The agent working with me put together everything I needed, charged my credit card for the $11 fee, and gave me a confirmation number.Two days later with NO input from me or contact with me, my trip to longer exists.  The miles were replaced in my account, and $11 credited to my card.I understand airlines are struggling, but this is no way to operate any business!!!"
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Supervising gate agent combative,"A woman identifying herself as the supervising desk agent had a hissie fit when my son asked  if he could check with a stewardess to see if there was room to store his bag in an overhead compartment before they checked it.  Even though the stewardess indicated that there was plenty of room, the flight was only about 25 percent full, the desk agent was telling everyone that all bags needed to be checked. She even called the police claiming my son was unruly. There is no way this son was ""unruly"", she just didn't like anyone questioningly her arbitrary decree. We don't have a name but she appeared to be a mix of African American and Latina. Delta you need to check her out, there is no way she hasn't done similar things before. She is going to get you sued some day."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Non Existent Customer Service,"I am on the phone right now. It’s almost been 3 hours. I could complete an entire novel and then some by the time they “answer.”My family recently came down with the covid variant that is sweeping through MO. I’ve been trying to get in touch with someone all day!What makes no sense is there are so many people out of work, looking for work. This job could easily be done from someone’s house. How is it that they don’t have enough people to answer the phones?If they refuse to give me some type of credit. I will never fly this airline again. I did the same thing with United when they “escorted” that doctor off their plane. Haven’t flown on it since. I don’t understand how anyone can know this is going on and not get every available person to help. How would they even know that you are needing to reschedule, missed a connecting flight etc if they never pick up their phones?!!Yeah this is a sad day for this airline."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Rude,"People may call me a Karen for this one but it’s not the reason that we have to wear masks, I understand that it is federal law, but I was on my way back from Florida when on my flight there were many that did not agree but ended up wearing them anyways. I heard the flight attendants laughing about how they just “had to threaten them just a little” about having a “talk after we land if you don’t keep your mask on”. It made it sound like they thought we were all either children or stupid. It made me see clearly that wearing masks now is just about controlling people, and them laughing about it made me realize that it is not acceptable."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Delta airlines sucks,"I booked a flight for a family of six within the 24 hour time change window, One of the travelers who was a minor who was flying in from somewhere else his flight was rerouted. So I have been trying to contact Delta for over a month to cancel the one flight. And actually connect the parent at a different airport so that they can meet the minor. Because all of the tickets were booked at once they’re under one reservation so I cannot change just one ticketed passenger I have tried calling every day for a month. I have also tried the chat option where is they only message you every hour to see if you still need help and you have to answer a or B and then they ask you once you verify you still need help if you’d like to still speak to a representative and then as soon as you do not respond they take you out of the queue so this is been going on for a month now and I’m taken out of the queue around 2 AM or 3 AM every morning when I no longer can stay in the queue because I must sleep. I have status on this airline and have used them for years however they want to blame this on Covid and I still cannot get anyone on the phone and our flights will be leaving next week I’m certain they’ll tell me it was outside of the 24 hour time window and I canNot be refunded. If you have an option to fly another airline I would suggest choosing one that actually has people who can modify flights and get their asses on the phone."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Delayed Flight,"I am very disappointed in Delta. I chose them over a budget airline even though they are three times as expensive. We got to the airport 2 hours before our flight and get an update that the flight is delayed from 8:45PM to 10:02PM. So we go grab dinner and wait. Then we walk to the gate and get another update that it’s now delayed until 11:26PM. It’s so annoying. All the rushing all day to fly out closer to midnight. No apologies from the lady at the gate. Seems like this is the way it is so deal with it. Then the sound on my monitor wasn’t working (which they ultimately fixed). They couldn’t dim the lights in the cabin because there was some technical issue. Overall a horrible experience. When we got to LA, we missed the flyaway and had to get an Uber home. All this to say… this is the kind of experience you’d expect from a budget flight so I’m left wondering why I should pay more for future flights and instead might just go with Spirit or Frontier for a fraction of the cost. Delta has lost their way, especially when it comes to customer service."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Very unprofessional,"I normally love to fly Delta. But they changed my flight 3 days before I’m supposed to leave, changing me from a direct flight to a 4 hour layover, having to be at the airport 2 hours earlier and arriving 2 hours later. I paid for Comfort+ for my wife and I 2 weeks prior to our original flight and with them changing our flight they decided to give me the comfort seating from SLC to LAX instead of SLC to Honolulu and had us sitting apart. I can change my flight BACK TO MY ORIGINAL FLIGHT!! But if I want my seats I paid for, I have to pay an additional $500!!!! I’ve been on hold with them for 4 hours as of writing this trying to get this changed because that is very unprofessional"
Date of travel: July 2021,10,"No air, garbage in seat packet",First flight was ok but they filled up first class with coach & then served all them first. One man kept taking his mask off that came from coach. Second flight first class was full & my air did not work at all I sweated all the way there.  Next got picked up at airport by the people I having a business meeting with covered in sweat flying first class. To top it off they did nit even clean the garbage out of the seat pocket so I doubt they cleaned anything.Beverage was warm as they did not have any ice for the soda & this is first class at a very high ticket price also
Date of travel: July 2021,20,"Delta is not ready to fly, post-COVID","Delta was supposed to have a staff of 20 at the airport, but had only hired 6. My flight was delayed 2 hours departing and I'm having to overnight in Detroit because they failed to make my booked connection."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,"Run; Don't Buy a Delta Ticket Customer Service Really,  Really, Really Sucks","I recommend flying any other Airlne. I bought a ticket for a biz trip. The meeting changed.  I tried for two days - a total of 7 hours on hold trying to cancel/get a refund on a first class flight.  Their website makes it nearly impossible to do this. The have the worst text based help line.  No one answered my question/request, the phone line said, 'Your call os important; ' wait time will exceed towo hours'. You will be disconnected when someone finally answers; that person will not call you back.  Avoid the pain, don't fly Delta"
Date of travel: July 2021,30,Can't take a seat available on earlier flight,So seats available on an earlier flight but instead I have to sit in the airport for 3 hours just because of the kind of ticket I bought?  Ridiculous!  Delta will be my last choice from now on.
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Delta Changed  Our Seat Assignments At Gate Without Our Approval,"As a family of 8, we chose our seat assignments together at least one month before flight date. When we checked in at Delta desk, we were properly given our requested seating on our boarding passes. When we gave our boarding passes at the gate, one of our seats was changed to another distant location on the jet separating our family. The gate attendant didn’t give us any reason. This happened on both flight segments.  Flight attendant on jet told us that Delta reserved the right to change seat assignments for economy class tickets.  Need to pay more money for higher class seat to avoid this. Allowing passengers to select their own seating is purposely misleading by Delta. We’ll never fly Delta again!,"
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Never Again!!!,I have yet to complete my trip and have already decided I am DONE with Delta.  We are going on vacation in a few months and already Delta has screwed us over with changing our flights multiple times and seats.    Family of three which they had moved one of us to another row sitting by themself!! Originally booked a short(2-21/2 hr) layover in Atlanta which they changed to 5 hr layover.  What the h-ll are we supposed to do in Atlanta for 5 hrs?? We have to wait for 5 hours for a 1 hr flight home.  Freakin ridiculous.  So be aware and go online and check your seats(if assigned) regularly if it matters to you.
Date of travel: July 2021,30,Not great,"Legroom just about OK, seats felt a bit cramped (flight was completely full).Cabin crew almost completely gave up re masks. Although most people were masked up, many had ""chin masks"" on for most of the flight. Cabin crew either ignored this or  relied on the general cabin announcements.... pity. Service was not great. Basic food & drink, FAs were not especially friendly or happy to help. Definitely could do better."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Stuck on Stupid,This airline can’t get out of its own way! My Flight had mechanical issues so I was going to miss my connecting flight in Detroit. They (pleasantly) found me a different flight but had me on stand bye?!?! WYF! I paid for 1st class and they said well you can call and get a partial refund? NOPE i don’t think so! it wasn’t my fault your plane broke! have the proper equipment to get the job done the 1st time around. I hate to say it but never have these issues with American
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Rerouted due to lack of proper fueling,"Currently sitting in Boise, ID an hour after we were supposed to land in SLC. Rerouted due to improper fueling and lack of fuel to actually land, not sure if we’re being told all the details but currently on a plane full of upset people. Comically bad way to reintroduce your business following a year of downtime due to COVID."

Date of travel: July 2021,10,Abandoned with 3 children,"My family's  flight from Orlando to NYC was delayed due to bad weather and therefore my wife and 3 children  missed the connection to Amsterdam and Norwich in England. They were told that it was their problem because the booking was with Virgin. My wife was lied to, abandoned with 3 children in New York. She had to try and find a hotel, nobody assisted her, The captain actually did try to help and said that she could get the next flight. He escorted her to the gate but she was refused entry. The Delta steward  at the desk refused to listen to her and walked away because he said it was not his problem. Eventually another passenger helped my wife to find a hotel. I actually believe that the Delta staff put my family in danger. Oh, and to add insult to injury, the lost all the 6 suitcases of luggage. We will never travel with this dreadful company again. Fortunately, we managed to contact Virgin who got us off the Delta flight and out us on a Virgin one, although we had to change our destination from Norwich to London."

I called Delta customer service after been on hold for 3.1/2 hour representative told me that they have charged penalty of $200.00 for use of $37.00 e credit I had. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT SHOULD I SAY!!!!Except bunch of thief take over of this company and treat people and customers like a fool. who will use $37.00 credit if they knew and delta was disclosed it will be charge for $200.00.I have been using delta for entire my life , their customer service, inflight service and prices become nightmare and got worst every years. They have No decency  and class to provide explanation for charges before people purchase their tickets.I would not use delta and NOT recommended . Just careful and DO NOT listen to their false advertisement claiming NO cancelation and change fees. ALL LIE!!!!!!!"
Date of travel: July 2021,10,VERY BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE,"TerribleWaiting since last 2 hours 40 mins to talk with a customer representative and they just keep you on waiting and waiting.Doesn't care about customers False promise that ""someone will connect less than 2 hours""Not in messaging service too, it's crapWorst EverNever Ever Go with DeltaNobody listen youWorst Service"
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Horrified,"I have been flying for my job for 42 years and this flight takes the prize for the worst experience flying that I have ever had. Let me begin by saying that in my opinion AeroMexico is the most incompetent airline in the industry. They have NO method of communication regarding your flight status. They can't reschedule your flight that they just caused you to miss and good luck figuring out how to pair your luggage with your next flight. When I finally made it to Mexico City, the Delta reps weren't a whole lot better. Bottom line. I have spent two days in Mexico City trying to get home. Last I heard, my luggage was somewhere in California. ( I am going to Detroit ) I have written the luggage off as a loss. As I write this, I am still stuck in Mexico City just praying I one day step foot back in the USA."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Shockingly bad service - never again,in 2004 I had a terrible experience with Delta airlines and vowed to NEVER fly them again.  Since they lost me as a customer I have done a lot of travel on other airlines (I am Global Services on United).My husband decided to take a Delta Flight from Sacramento to Atlanta (via Seattle).  I booked the flight 4 weeks ago and paid full price for a Business Class Seat.  We selected business class seats and got a confirmation.When he went to check in he had been moved from Business Class to the back of the plane in a middle seat on the Seattle to Atlanta leg of the flightWe tried to call Delta Customer service and it was a NINE HOUR WAIT TO SPEAK TO CUSTOMER SERVICE.      Obviously he hung up and will just try to get his seat assignment at the airport.I spent 18 year avoiding Delta Airlines and today was a reminder why.   Never again will I even consider using them again
Date of travel: July 2021,20,Be weary of booking with Delta,"I booked a ticket in advance during the COVID-19 grace period. I was ensured that my ticket was fully changeable and refundable, without any fees or strings attached. Due to my international flight being cancelled, I attempted to cancel my Delta domestic flight. It was unclear from their online form whether I would be receiving a full refund as promised or not. I tried calling Delta and was on hold for 2 hours only to be hung up on. After trying to call several more times with no luck, I decided to go ahead and cancel, since I was in a time crunch. I was very disappointed to have been given ECREDIT despite being promised a full refund BEFORE I even booked the ticket. I even explicitly wrote in the form ""Do not give me ecredit"", and they did anyway. Again I tried to call, with the same extreme wait times, which makes it impossible to talk to anyone. It was even more disappointing to find out that apparently I have to use the ecredit within 8 months or it will expire... The fact that they gave me ecredit instead of the refund they promised, plus putting such a short DEADLINE on it (what should be MY MONEY) is such sneaky and gross behavior. I am beyond disappointed with Delta."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Delta CEO Asleep At The Wheel,"I have been flying Delta for decades and Delta always top drawer. The current CEO appears to have taken his hands off the wheel! With my recent experience, I am worrying about whether they have safe aircrafts any more! Below is what I experience up to this point:1. Despite the claim of being clean and safe, I found food crumbs on the seat and tray area when I got to my seat (mind you, this is a trans continental flight).2. During flights, a couple of flight attendants were busy reading their phone for extended time while the other two were having problems coping with serving customers.As a result, most stuff were left sitting around without pick up. Bathrooms were not policed, were gross and worse than bus toilets.3. Figuring it was an abnormally, I booked Delta again. That was one giant mistake! I had a confirmed reservation with seat selected. Well, they bumped be off a good schedule which I paid higher prices  for, probably sold my seats for a higher price, then allow me to rebook back to lower quality schedule. Really questionable reservation operation. To add insult to injury, their reservation had multiple hours wait time ( I know as I waited for three hours without anyone answering, the second time was one and a half hour also with no one answering). This is going for close to a week now. 4. If you are thinking of booking Delta, think again. They used to be good but not any more. Pick an airline that goes direct as their multiple legs with transfer hubs are no longer working the way it was and no one on the other end to help you fix things!"
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Disorganized and poor communication,It began with a two flight process to get back home from Las Vegas. The entire ordeal turned into a 24+ hour nightmare from hell. The entire experience was horrible and it wasn't the mechanical issues that were most frustrating. It was the lack of effective communication and the disganized nature of their staff. We were directed to one counter once we unboarded and then at the counter were told to go to another counter. The phone service they directed us to versus resolving it at the service counter stated several of the tasks we needed could not be done over the phone so we had to get back in line. I've flown for years and I have never experienced such poor customer service and lack of communication of what was going on. I'd recommended not flying Delta if your goal is to get to your final destination.
Date of travel: July 2021,20,SkyWest dba Delta Connection often chooses to cancel/delay these flights.,"Last week Delta flight # 4265 was first announced as a 40- minute delay leaving MSP one hour before scheduled 9:40 p.m. departure. and then canceled an hour later. Had to demand Delta provide hotel room and a ride for the night, getting less than 4 hours of sleep before arriving for their 8:11 a.m. departure for Brainerd the next day. These flights -- both ways between Brainerd and Minneapolis -- are often delayed or canceled. They plead mechanical problems but actually they make business- profit decisions when deciding. Weather was perfect. SkyWest will divert their planes to where they generate the most revenue, leaving Brainerd passengers in the lurch.Daughter was offered a choice of either $100 back for this flight, or the hotel room. She chose the hotel. Also given 12,500 miles to my SkyMiles account. Yesterday-- a week later -- my son's BRD to MSP flight (Delta 4242) was delayed by 2 hours. This would have caused him to miss his next two flight legs out of MSP and JFK. But enough notice was given, allowing a family member to DRIVE the 5 1/2-hour round trip to MSP so he could make his other flights. Otherwise his trip would have been delayed one full day.  He got $100 refund, no miles -- big deal.SkyWest, instead, should just run buses between BRD and MSP."

Now have 10 hour overnight layover at Anchorage and Delta will not help get me earlier flight, or pay for hotel.

Date of travel: July 2021,50,Family Reunion,"Best airline I ever flew on so I’m rating.  Service from pilots & crew is applauded!  Return trip was challenging as I hurt my shoulder & knees already ache.  Hats off to Detroit MI who let me explain why I wanted to board early.... I think it’s foolish to load front of plane before back esp for people like me.  Chanel was stewardess & she came to help me load luggage & retrieved my bags when I got off.  TSA Steve was an Angel!  He stopped me because my mask was pulled down & when I explained I was out of breath running one end to other because of gate changes,  Steve helped me & walked me upstairs to tram, explained how it worked and walked me to my gate!  Seats are a little small but the policies are firm & there were no arguments on my flights.  Hats off to Delta!  I’m not a frequent flyer but I will be back because of service received!"
Date of travel: July 2021,10,The worse day ever!,Due to extremely long lines just tp check in luggage and lack of employees to actually speed up the process.  My family and I were told by one of the customer service representatives that they would not be able to take our luggage because the luggage section on our plane was closed.  So apparently they close the luggage loading area an hour before the flight takes off.  So we hadn't missed our flight but apparently we missed the opportunity to put our luggage on the flight.  So when I asked her what my options where she nonchalantly says you must go to the rebook area and speak with someone there.  So I chug my luggage and my family to the rebook area where only one employee was at that station attending everyone who had an issue with their flight.  I finally get to speak with the representative who told me the best thing she could do is reschedule us on another flight the next day for an additional $300.  That isn't the worst of the story so we make it to the flight the next day and when we are boarding are told that there was no more room for our carry on luggage so they would be sending it to the luggage area.  Mind you it was only a few minutes before or flight takes off.  So they according to the baggage check area that part of the plane is closed an hour before the flight but if the employee at the boarding area says your luggage needs to be placed in the body of the plane they make an accepting to the hour rule.  My family and I will never ever fly Delta again in our lives.
Date of travel: July 2021,20,Checked bags,Boards from back to front and made me check my bag with plenty of over head space available. Very dissatisfied.
Date of travel: June 2021,20,Lost baggage disaster,"My bag was sent to the Dominican Republic instead of Antigua/Barbuda, it took countless phone calls @ my expense & numerous emails attempting to get my luggage to our location. I was without my luggage for over 4 1/2 days! This bag contained all clothes,shoes & toiletries but most importantly it had my daily blood pressure medication in it. Delta showed very little concern over the matter until the 3rd day without my bag & the 4th person I spoke too. It really put a damper on our all inclusive vacation, I'm just thankful it wasn't my wife's bag. I figured Delta would make it right but all we received was a $30 luggage refund & two  $300 travel vouchers, which doesn't even cover a ONE way ticket in US much less overseas!!I always believed Delta to be the best passenger airline but after this experience I'm not so sure. The lack of customer service or concern was unbelievable & to top it off with those measly vouchers was a slap in the face. Hopefully this doesn't happen to anyone else.Brenden"
Date of travel: July 2021,20,Delta: Left hand has no clue what the right hand is doing!,"My wife and I had RT reservations from Tucson to Guadalajara leaving in a couple of days and returning at a later date. Going to Guadalajara we were to fly Tucson to Salt Lake City to Guadalajara. Returning to Tucson we were to fly Guadalajara to Atlanta to Tucson.Last night (July 17) I happened to open my Delta phone app to see when my flight check in could occur. I noticed a bunch of red mouse text which I could not make out. I logged onto the Delta website from my desktop and discovered Delta had changed their schedule on the Atlanta to Tucson flight such that we would land in Atlanta around 6:30PM but miss our Atlanta to Tucson flight.I called the number referenced in the mouse print and eventually got through to a Delta rep. Essentially I was told we would have to spend the night in Atlanta and fly back to Tucson the next morning. I asked about a flight from Guadalajara to Los Angeles to Tucson that arrived to Tucson between 4PM and 5 PM on the same day but the flight from Guadalajara to Los Angeles would require us to leave too early to get to the airport in Guadalajara on time. Our option was the layover in Atlanta. I asked the rep if Delta would cover our hotel expense and was told to “ask for a voucher” when we arrived at Atlanta. However, it was not clear who I was supposed to ask! Also, we would be on this trip for quite a while and each had 2 checked bags that we wanted to check with Delta in Guadalajara and pick up in Tucson when we arrived. I specifically mentioned I did not want to have to deal with 4 bags that we would have to take to the hotel and then repeat the process the next morning on our way back to the Atlanta airport. I was told our bags would be checked in from Guadalajara all the way to Tucson.This morning (July 18) I went to the Delta Facebook page to see if I could get some clarification on what I was told the night before. I eventually had a messenger conversation with a Delta rep. This person I was chatting with said “I apologize for the schedule change. We do not offer hotel vouchers for schedule changes.” When I asked about the Guadalajara-Los Angeles-Tucson flight with the first part on Aero Mexico I was told “unfortunately there is not another flight option. We are not able to reprotect on Aeromexico. I am sorry you were given mis-information. As a goodwill gesture I can offer you each a $100 voucher towards your next flight” I responded that I did not want a voucher for a future flight since I had no intention of flying Delta in future. I asked to escalate my conversation to a supervisor and was told “I am a supervisor. I'm sorry you were told that, we are not able to reprotect on AeroMexico. I see hotels start at $80 a night. To compensate for the incorrect information I can take off $150 off of your ticket only. This is a one time offer, we do not normally offer this. This is an exception since we can not offer a hotel voucher.” The Delta rep then said “The original connection is no longer operating. Unfortunately all flights returning to TUS will be a forced overnight. Can you return to PHX instead?” I told the rep that Phoenix was more than 120 miles from my home. I asked the rep to give me a few minutes to talk to my wife about the Phoenix option and to see what additional expense we would incur. The flight from Atlanta to Phoenix did not arrive until close to 11PM and we would have to rent a car one way to drive home the next morning after spending the night in Phoenix instead of Atlanta. The rental rate and hotel stay would have cost about $240. I got back to the Delta rep and asked if the $150 offer would be available with the Phoenix option. I was told “The $150 is to cover the hotel expense since you were told incorrect information on hotel compensation. If you choose the ATL to PHX flight the $150 would not apply.” When I pointed out we would have to spend the night in Phoenix because of the late arrival time, I was told “Unfortunately since the flight arrives on the same day… I can not authorize to cover a hotel in PHX”So, I told the rep to leave all flights as is and to not change us to the PHX option. The rep never got back to me to confirm my desire to leave things as is with the Atlanta overnight.I then called the same phone number I called last night (July 17) and eventually spoke to a Delta rep who apologized profusely for the flight schedule change. I mentioned to him that when we purchased the tickets (first time we ever flew first class) we were scheduled to be back to Tucson at 10:34 in the evening where a neighbor was going to pick us up. I mentioned we did not want to spend a night in Atlanta and he agreed. I asked him about the Guadalajara-Los Angeles-Tuscon flight I had spoken to the previous two Delta reps about and he said he would speak to his supervisor about changing us to that option. It took about thirty minutes while I was on hold BUT he was able to change us to the AeroMexico flight from Guadalajara to Los Angeles then the Delta flight from Los Angeles to Tucson. So much for the veracity of the Delta supervisor’s information I was given during our messenger chat which indicated the AeroMexico flight was not an option.So in the end we are happy to NOT have to spend an uncompensated night on the road because of Delta’s schedule change and we actually get home about 5 hours earlier than our original schedule. However, I am not happy about the fact that I spent almost 4 hours of my time dealing with an issue that should have been resolved without having to speak to three different Delta reps. Instead of having a rep tell me all the things Delta couldn’t or wouldn’t do for one of their customers, I had a final experience that graciously resolved our issue and might change my mind about flying Delta in future."

Date of travel: July 2021,10,Taunted by Delta employee “Maya”,"I am not a frequent flyer, flying from Ga, to WI, and back.First flight out from Atlanta we stood in line so long waiting to check in that when we finally got to the line they told us we missed our flig HR, so we had to wait 4hrs for next flight…Now on the return flight home, leaving WI, the flight left 30 min late, when landing they told us since we were late they would hold out connecting flight, we ran to the flight deck and met Maya, a delta employee, she informed us that the flight had already left, and when I voiced my frustration, since this is the semiconductor flight we missed because of delta and not of our own error, maya began to mock me and was very disrespectful, after asking her name and that she should be a little bit more understanding and instead she mocked me a second time. That’s it for me, I will never fly delta again, I am literally dumbfounded that an employee could be so disrespectful."
Date of travel: July 2021,50,The airline was great.  The St. airport was a disaster.,"The airline (Delta) was great. But the St. thomas airport is a disaster.  One jammed up food concession  with barely eatable food.  but the worst of it was the long lines for customs and security.  The agents in both areas were surly and certainly not in any hurry (island time is just another word for ""we don't care"").  I was cautioned to arrive 4 hours early and it was good advise.  The islands are beautiful.  I was disappointed in the locals.  I guess it's been a tough year but they did not seem to welcome back travelers.  certainly not this one."

Date of travel: July 2021,40,Economy Plus seats were great!,"After our experience on United, Delta was a breath of fresh air.  I haven't flown Delta in quite some time and I have to say it was a step above United.  Post Covid service is about the same across all airline these days so for me it is all about the seats and these seats were comfortable."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Delta continues to get worse,"We used to travel exclusively on Delta, but recently we traveled internationally and the service was horrible!  The food was terrible. It tasted like bad microwaved food.      The movie choices were terrible as well.  Very few popular movies and most of them were very old. Checking in with Delta was disastrous and completely disorganized.  We were asked to show our documents twice at two spots while waiting in line for over an hour (this was not the case for other airlines, those travelers walked by laughing at our miserable existence in our line). Our flight leaving Athens was 1 hour late and once we got to JFK to connect to Cleveland, our flight was cancelled due to weather. This is completely understandable, but the board at the gate continued to say ""on time"" long after the cancellation. Fortunately, we looked at our phones to see it was cancelled, which then caused confusion (cancelled or not?).  When I tried to get verification, the attendant was very short, rude, and generally unhelpful.  When an announcement was finally made, we were given bad information. Travellers were told there were two different desks to go to in order to make new flight arrangements if the ones they made were unacceptable.  However, only ONE of the desks was open and we waited for over 2 hours in that one line.  The online help was worse. I was told in an email that I could get a refund if desired (we chose to rent a car and drive the rest of the way), but once I logged on, I was told I can't change the flight (which was for the next day AND had a layover in Atlanta (How dumb is that? Such a waste of fossil fuel!).    Getting our checked baggage was a nightmare. We were told it would be 3-5 hours to get our bags back! I'm still waiting on the bags (2 hours so far) so who knows how accurate that will be. The service and quality has gone down so much over the last few years!  Pay a little extra for a better experience with another airline.  I recommend United.  Great service and food!"

I haven't flown in 20 years and I was terrified of flying prior to that. The flight crew member Nicole and the man (im sorry I forgot your name) pulled me aside and talked to me genuinely for a while.  Nicole helped me so much.  Thanks to the pilot captain for announcing when there would be turbulence so I could prepare myself mentally.   Because of your flight crew.  I'm no longer afraid to fly.  Thanks  a million

We got delayed an extra 3 hours in Seattle on our way to Phoenix.  Then on our way back to Eugene we ended up delayed 6 hours in SLC.  Plus we bought Delta + and we had to change our flight to come home a day early I paid $24 more dollars which was ok but, we ended up in coach for the first leg of the flight. Pretty frustrating.  They did give us $15 food vouchers but, everything closes at 10PM SO USE YOUR VOUCHERS BEFORE 10PM."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Garbage,We had to cancel our flight because my mother got a positive test result back. For days we've been trying to call them and unable to get through. The call automatically hangs up at the 2hr mark. It's been 4 days and we still haven't spoken to anyone. They don't even offer a callback option. We drove to the airport to see if we could change or cancel the flight and they told us my mom has to be there and they can't change it. how? She  was tested positive! I cant even see the e credit that was supposedly issue. We are out $333 for a 1 way flight. This airline is no more than a joke. They make spirit airlines look good.

My flight was delayed hour after hour after hour from 6pm to 1am, then they ended up cancelling it. My mother and I were stranded in New York with nowhere to go at 1Am and I swear the employee was treating us like homeless people begging for change.They have the worst customer service Ive ever seen. At every turn it feels like to get any information out of them I had to beg them to answer me. My mother broke down in tears and they were just talking down to us like we were in the wrong asking for a new flight in the morning. I ended up booking a flight on a whole new airline and just taking the loss i couldnt deal with them. I pray for anyone with weak english trying to talk to these people.tldr book delta if you like sleeping on the airport floor."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Delta has be come the Penultimate in customer service,"Don't waste your time on Delta. I spent over 9 hours on hold. Don't waste your money, they are not an American company anymore. Delta has reached New lows. They sold out, and outsourced the customer service to Mumbai. There is no customer service. Nice to know they were bolstered by the Feds while good American businesses fell by the wayside during the pandemic. I had to cancel my Delta flight and go with another airline since they couldn't pick the phone up FOR 9 HOURS. Then my $900 was ""lost"" for a week. I'm on hold right now AGAIN... If there were negative star ratings Delta would have them."

Date of travel: July 2021,10,DO NOT FLY HERE AT ALL!,"Unprofessional! Careless! Inconsiderate! Then arriving.... My flight was delayed 4 times then canceled. Their reason was the pilot was running late. By the 3rd delay passengers were told the polite called out of work. One would think way delta is just now finding this out now. And why a backup plan was not in place. We were held waiting for another pilot until they canceled the flight and the delta crew behind the counter fled like cowards. A lot of passengers wanted answers. My flight was moved to 8pm the next day. (already 2 days of vacation down the drain). Just when I thought it couldn't get any worst.... When trying to fly back home. The plane was once again delayed. The reason? They need 5 flight attendants to fly. They only had 4 currently bc the 5th person is stuck in traffic. When the 5th flight attendant showed up... all 5 of them had lunch at another gate so they won't be seen. Unbelievable know they caused the delay. By the time we boarded the weather has gotten worst and I am literally sitting in the plane on the runaway on another delay writing this review. This would be the 3rd delay by now. Delta really is the worst agency there is and I would never purchase or flying delta again. Spirit would definitely be a better option and that's sad to say. I lost more money dealing with delta which is mind blowing. Lost of pay not making it to work, lost on money on my hotel since my flight was canceled, and having to commute multiple times in cabs. The best way delta can improve is to press the rest button, hire people who what's to work and do their job, and sell the company. They don't deserve 1 star"
Date of travel: July 2021,10,"Delta, the Trash Can of the Skies","It's so simple: If a customer is not able to use your product, refund them. Why break tickets down into ""Basic Economy"" and other nonsense if not to punish poor people for being poor? I've waited on the phone for three hours and 59 minutes now to speak to someone, and the internet tells me it could be another 41 hours to go, on average. I will never fly Delta again. In fact, I will never again accept a visit from someone flying Delta. Basic human decency, which Delta lacks, would have been so easy to show, and would have prevented me and all these other customers from becoming so enraged."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Worst experience of my life,"Recently this Thursday, I had the worst experience I have ever encountered on an airplane flight. My family and I had important plans to fly into New York, LGA. However, during our fly, about a half an hour away from LGA the captain of the plane informed us we will be having a delay and they will be stopping the plane in Atlanta. We were upset but understood this is due to weather conditions, and they let us know it would probably be a 1-2 hour delay and to stay close to the terminal when we get off the airplane. When we got off, we were then informed that our flight was actually going to be delayed until 8AM in the morning! Shocked, we proceeded to find a help desk to see what we were going to do. As we were walking, we noticed another flight that was boarding for the same place we were supposed to go to, LGA! We were so confused on how they were able to go but we were not? We stood in a very long line with only 2 employees at the counter, and we received a hotel voucher for the Radisson which gave us a $40 discount, we still had to pay $108 for the hotel room which was shocking to us! We were also told that we would use the SAME tickets we had tomorrow morning at the Atlanta Airport. When we asked an Atlanta Airport employee where the shuttle was for the hotel, he looked at us completely clueless and like he was under hard influence of something, so we kept walking and hoped we would eventually find the shuttle ourselves! We were also told the flight would be departing at 8AM, so we had to wake up early in the morning and catch the 5:30 AM shuttle to the Atlanta Airport. This is really when the true nightmare began, as we asked an employee where we should go with our tickets, and she told us since we already had the tickets from our delayed flight we could hop in line for the regular security route. So, after waiting 15-20 minutes in line we went up to the employee who scans the boarding passes and was told “We cannot take these passes you need new ones, leave out that exit door” and we were rudely told to leave as the employee got frustrated with us as we were trying to explain our situation. We then got in line for Special Services, which the security employee directed us too by pointing. It was 5:30 AM and there was no employees there to even help us yet because they were in a briefing, so we were told by another employee they won’t be available until 6AM! Astonished, we got in another line for Special Services and waited about 25 more minutes. We were then greeted by a man all the way at the right side corner, and we attempted to explain our situation with him. He got very rude with us and told us our flight was now taking off at 6:30 AM and that he would not give us new boarding passes and INSISTED that we could use the same ones we had even after getting kicked out of security! My father tried to explain further to him, and he replied “Would you rather just sit here and argue with me and miss you flight?” I was astonished by this type of treatment, I truly felt like I was highly disrespected after spending over 1000 dollars this month on flights with Delta! He refused to even look at our boarding passes. We then headed over back by security and began trying to explain our situation to another lady who told us we needed new boarding tickets as well. However, another worker heard us in distress and walked over to us. She was a customer relations worker, I had forgotten to get her name however she was the nicest most helpful woman we had met at the Atlanta Airport. She waited with us and got another man who was referred as the “red jacket” of Delta. He got us through to skip all of the security line, and then we were greeted by the employee said “oh yeah we can take those tickets.” It seemed like a joke to them after all of the stress we went through, thinking we were possibly going to miss our flight now. Through all of this, we were never even told what gate to go to or what time it would officially be departing so we spent an extra 30 minutes talking to others and trying to find the correct flight. We were never even emailed any information or told where to go at all! I asked another woman at the counter if she knew what gate LGA would be flying out of, and was told “Flight information is downstairs.” And then she proceeded to have another conversation with her coworker. Frustrated, we headed downstairs and had found no employees or anyone who knew where to direct us because our tickets were not updated. However, we did end up taking the train and making it to our terminal JUST as we were boarding! It turns out the rude man at the counter was wrong, the flight was not departing at 6:30AM it was still 8AM so all of my stress to miss my flight was for no reason at all but lack of staff knowledge! I was so stressed and exhausted overall from this experience, which costed me over 1000 dollars! I feel like I spent my money to be treated with DISRESPECT!!! I will NEVER fly Delta again, you have officially lost my business with horrible customer service and no sympathy at all. Many of my fellow passengers on the same flight had similar awful experiences as well. I will never fly Delta again, I want my money back for all of this stress and aggravation I had to go through for a delayed flight where I was treated like garbage! I will never again recommend this airline because of the horrible treatment I went through. I can’t even believe we had to pay for a hotel room, and I feel bad for all of the other passengers who had to endure similar experiences. Never again will I pay to be disregarded and disrespected by Delta."
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Delta vacations is a rip off. Beware.,I booked a hotel in the keys only to find out that delta vacations ripped me off royally. They charged me 634.00 dollars per night plus state and local taxes plus resort fees.  I stayed another day and got the exact same room for 280.00 dollars plus all fees and taxes.  Delta vacations gouged me more than double what I could have booked this hotel myself for. When contacting them by phone and email I wasted 10 days and countless hours on hold.  Rogue players stay away is my advise. I love delta airlines don’t understand why they are associated with delta vacations.  Beware

Spent over an hour having to repeat and repeat because they went offline, they wouldn't accept my perfectly fine zip code, they wanted me to rate their site and ,when I said I would, that threw me back to the beginning, too. Tried to call ""customer help"" and they were so busy they wouldn't even let me stay on the line. And, as if all that was not enough, they double charged my credit card. Their online is nothing more than ads and telling us how wonderful they are. And all this hassle started because THEY changed the departure time which got us into Seattle to late. When the change was finally done, their brilliant computer didn't even give my wife and I seats together, although there were plenty of open seats. never again!"

We were running out of time to check-in, so he dropped me off  with our bags curbside Delta Airlines.  He went inside and found a Delta agent who came out to the curb, checked us in, gave me our boarding passes, and tagged our bags.  She told him where to park and reassured me that we were on time for our flight.  I told her that I have a walking issue, so she arranged to have a wheelchair waiting for me, when our flight arrived at SEA/TAC."

We scrambled to find a new flight at the wedding as we are on a tight schedule to return home. Each Delta employee we spoke to at the airport (waited in 2 lines) and on the phone (made 3 phone calls that lasted a total of FIVE HOURS and counting) kept passing us off to another department. I am literally on hold with them right now as write this (It's been 2 hours and 43 minutes).We have not been refunded for the original flights and have no explanation as to what happened."

I had to find out just by luckily checking online it was canceled. Then we spend an hour on hold on the phone for them to tell us we need to come to the airport for assistance. THEN we spend an hour waiting to get re booked for a flight that leaves Nashville at 1pm and arrives at Boston 11pm the next day. They put us up in a hotel, another hour later, because they needed to find out why the flight was canceled. If it was canceled because of weather then we woulda been screwed they wouldn't have done anything. Basically woulda just told us sucks to suck. They say it was canceled for mechanical issues acting like its this wicked reassuring thing that they have broken planes. I've flown American, Southwest, Jetblue, Spirit & Delta but these guys are the only ones this has happened with. I wouldn't recommend them to my worst enemy. I'd feel to bad for my worst enemy."

(this was a lot of money to have to come up with on the spot to ""repurchase"" new reservations) No warning was given that the expired card would be needed. One justification cites fraud risk on the customer but the transaction had long since cleared and identification was provided. Why was that still not sufficient? I still do not understand. Credit card providers instruct consumers to destroy expired credit cards to reduce fraud risk. This issue inconvenienced my party greatly. After being issued excuses for this incident, there is no longer any interest in doing business with Delta Airlines in the future. This was my first airline experience ever and my last with Delta. The company could have handled this better as not to have inconvenienced us so greatly. Our trip was almost ruined because of this and switching our seats on the return flight unbeknownst to us, at the last minute, and without reason was added insult to injury.

Date of travel: June 2021,10,Never again,"Delta is right back on our ""no fly"" list. My husband has flown all over the world for years, the only airline that has ever lost his luggage is Delta (multiple times) and always out of Atlanta. About 7 years ago he flew to a week long conference, via Atlanta, where his luggage was lost for the entire week. It finally arrived just in time for him to recheck it for the trip home, via Atlanta, where it was lost again!!! This was the final straw, we haven't flown Delta since....until last week. On the third attempt to take a vacation we planned pre covid, Delta had the only flight with seats available. Hesitantly we booked and flew, via Atlanta. You guessed it, 2 of 3 bags were lost! One bag was all our clothing, the other was dive gear. Of course this cost us an entire day of diving. When looking for reimbursement, Delta says $50/day, and they want receipts. We didn't purchase anything to replace items, we lost a day of diving! That is hundreds of dollars! How about reimburse us for the delay of our vacation and what it cost us NOT to be on that dive boat! I won't even start on the lackadaisical attitude of the staff when dealing with the lost luggage.On a side note, the crew seemed as though they didn't actually want to be there and we were unable to connect to the wifi in flight. Minor irritants in the grand scheme, but worth mentioning.You may ask why I am posting on FB rather than filling out a survey? The answer is, I tried. As soon as I rated a 1 it said the survey expired. Seriously? We just got home last night at midnight.. They want me to fill this thing out WHILE on vacation?No thank you.

When I went to cancel the flight, I was told there would only be a credit for Delta, so now I have to shell out more money to fly home on a return flight."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Front desk,I Casper Wyoming airport. The front desk lady named Carrie for Delta Airlines was hostile and rude. She stood there while I was getting helped by a nice young man for about 10 minutes. I was upset but kept saying I’m sorry I know I’m frustrated etc etc. she then said “you need to be nice and say please and thank you to the front desk people in Denver “we take this home with us”. Well that’s a personal issue if you take your work home with you. But I didn’t say anything. When I stated I’m frustrated but I know he’s doing the best he can she came back with “you need to wear your mask” (a power play) I put my mask on respectively. She then left. Still getting help not even 2 minutes later she comes out with another worker both without a mask. And then a supervisor comes out without a mask.
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Worst customer service ever,"I cannot believe that customer service could possibly be this bad. I have spent 4 hours on phone, then 3 hours at airport, 22 hours on messaging (finally got through and was told it was fixed — surprise it is not) and now am on my fifth hour of hold on the phone. JFK lines were so long I finally gave up. So I have spent a total of 34 hours waiting to speak with someone to only have my one chance fail. There is something wrong with one of our 4 return tickets that no one can seem to figure out. I will never fly Delta again even if they get this fixed. This is unacceptable."
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Delta changed my travel itinerary and I was never able to reschedule or cancel my flight and get a refund.,"This is a complaint I wrote to Delta Airlines on May 30th, 2021 (Case Number: 04096861):""Delta just sent me an email to notify me that significant Flight Schedule Changes were made to my reservation. I was automatically re-booked on a flight schedule to depart at 1:26PM instead of 6:00OPM. Due to the nature of my trip, I am not able to take this flight. In the email I received it was stated that if I was not able to accomodate this change, it was possible to cancel this reservation and get a refund. However, when I tried to cancel my trip ALL the $303.20 value of the ticket was going to be lost in cancellation fees. This is UNACCEPTABLE. Recently I had the same exact issue with a flight I booked with United Airlines, and first of all I got 3 different alternative flight schedules to choose from, and since also in that case no one of the proposed changes fit my travel requirements, I had to cancel the flight and within a few days I got a FULL refund. Once again: this is DELTA changing my original flight in a way that makes it NOT compatible with my trip, and now I am not allowed to get a refund? This was going to be my FIRST time flying Delta, and I can ensure you it is instead going to be my LAST. Kind Regards, Angela Bononi""Delta Customer Care answered:""We wanted to let you know at this time our average response time is between 14 and 21 days.""Today is July 3rd, and I still have not received any reply, and I have not been able to speak to anyone on the phone.Again, I would like to reiterate: ""This was going to be my FIRST time flying Delta, and I can ensure you it is instead going to be my LAST."""
Date of travel: July 2021,10,Over 9 hours waiting for Customer service on the phone yesterday! WORST AIRLINE EVER,"We have a family emergency and my husband was supposed to fly with the 3 kids BOS-OAK July 6th but we needed to have me swap in and fly with them instead.  So yesterday I called Delta and entered my number for a call back which was supposed to be ""within 3 hours"" but after waiting by the phone for FIVE hours that call back never came.  I then called Delta 6 more times just to hear a recorded message telling me that ""wait times"" varied from 4-6 hours for a customer service agent.  Finally late last night the message said the ""wait time is less than 2 hours"" so I waited on hold for THREE HOURS FIFTY-ONE MINUTES and still no one answered the phone (see photo.)  By then it was 12:46am and I was exhausted, so I hung up and I called back at 6am E.S.T. hoping someone would finally help me -- message still said ""wait time is less than 2 hours.""  This is an absolute travesty!!  I WILL NEVER BOOK A FLIGHT WITH DELTA AGAIN BECAUSE DESPITE ALL OF THE ABOVE THEY WILL NOT ALLOW ME TO CHANGE MY HUSBAND'S TICKET INTO MY NAME AND THEY SAY THEY WILL NOT GIVE ME A REFUND.  The only way I finally reached someone (""Ann"") was by crapping on them on their Facebook page, so they direct messaged me, but still would not help me or give me a refund.  As I told Ann, yesterday I was a normal person and perhaps we would have resolved this amicably, but at this point I am frothing with rage and it is a breach of their duty to their customers to have wait times of 4+ hours for an Agent to come to the phone when there are issues that need to be resolved.  I cancelled  our flights altogether and booked new flights on Jet Blue (less expensive by the way, even though I booked Delta 6 weeks ago and I booked Jet Blue 48 hours before the flight.)  Never, ever fly Delta unless you can magically guarantee that you will never have to call their Customer Service for help, because if you do you will discover that it is absolutely impossible to get through to anyone.  Oh and by the way, just to ice the cake Ann offered that I could let my 3 kids fly alone as unaccompanied minors for $150 per kid since they would not let me take my husband's ticket.   Gee, thanks ANN!"
Date of travel: July 2021,10,No one there when we landed,Landed and they didn’t have staff to except the plane. Sat on the runway for 45 minutes I’ve never heard of this like it.
Date of travel: July 2021,10,DELTA Airlines SUCK!,They are rude. They don’t provide you with the services you pay for. I will never fly them again if I can help it! They are the worst airline!
Date of travel: June 2021,20,Lost baggage disaster,"We took an all inclusive trip to Antigua, Delta sent one piece of luggage to Santa Domingo, DR!! I went 4 1/2 days w/o my daily blood pressure medication & all belongings. I had to purchase an international phone plan because Delta wouldn't communicate thru Email,Twitter, FB msg or any platform. I wear XXL, so resort store had no options for clothes. I filled out a complaint form & even emailed the CEO.... all Delta offered was to reimburse clothing purchase with receipts that I don't have because  clothes purchased from beach vendors. very little concern from them to make it right or that I was almost 5 days w/o medication. Extremely disappointed in their lack of customer service, they give free flights & more away like candy to their 3 million mile medallion members but absolutely nothing for the avg customer."
Date of travel: June 2021,30,Customer service could use some upgrading.,"My actual flights were just fine. However, my flights were changed multiple times and we almost missed out connecting flight due to the original flight being delayed by the pilot choosing another runway and alternate flight pattern. They offered to change my flight to the NEXT DAY. Luckily they had to hold our second flight due to the copilot’s flight delay but they pretended like they were doing it for us. We had and issue with online checking that I remained on hold with Delta for 3-4 hours before just giving up. I am not sure how they can expect to retain customers with this poor level of service. Southwest is super responsive and free bags with free charges online if they reschedule your flights. I would have definitely flown southwest if they had restarted service to SJO because at least you can get help if something goes wrong."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,NEVER FLY DELTA,"This airline is by far the worst most unreliable airline I have ever flown with. Complete GARBAGE. The customer service is horrible. The people show no sympathy for anyone going through anything! Trying to get though to someone on the home is absolutely UNREALISTIC. I paid for my daughter to fly as an unaccompanied minor, she flew from LA to Charlotte & when I got to the airport to pick her up, DELTA WAS CLOSED. Nobody in the Charlotte airport could help me, not even TSA! The police threatened to Kick me out because of how ANGRY i was because I AM HERE TO PICK UP MY CHILD AND I CANNOT! I have only used Delta 2 times and both were the worst flights I have ever been on, and to trust the the my child was the worst decision I could have ever made. DO NOT FLY WITH THIS AIRLINE. it is expensive for NOTHING! DELTA!!! Get representatives to work for your company that show pride in customer service and go above and beyond to represent YOU! Terrible, Terrible airline. Negative stars if i could!"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Cannot reach anyone...EVER!,"Flying in Sept 2021, Internationally.  They cancelled the flight, rebooked it and sent an email with all of the changes.  Traveling with my son and we paid extra for the Delta Comfort, had chosen seats together...etc.  The changes they made are not acceptable and so to go in and try and get us seats together, or ""modify"" anything is IMPOSSIBLE as they seemingly locked that function!  No moving seats, no modifying.  Nothing actually works.  On my 3rd day of ""call back/text"" messaging .  No ""representative"" responds .  I get texts every hour asking if I'm still needing assistance and I respond yes.  12 hours a day, 3 days in a row - NOTHING.   Canceling our flight to rebook on United.    There is Covid short staffing issues, yes, and then there is just plain neglect of customer service."
Date of travel: June 2021,50,Wonderful flight AND crew!!!,"After a not so pleasant flight to Hawaii (via United) the flight home was AMAZING.  Easy check in.  Easy bag check.  SUPER SUPER nice staff.  Good meal, snacks, and drink service.  I was impressed!  Will DEFINITELY fly Delta again!  Great job!"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,"When things go wrong, you can't reach Delta","I have a work trip planned in September and purposely took an early afternoon flight to make dinner with clients.   Delta has changed my flight time getting me in at 9:45 pm instead.  I tried to change my flight online and it doesn't allow me too.  I have attempted to call 3 different customer service lines all with 5 plus hour wait times to talk to a live person.  The website insta message is automated.  Forget sending tweets, facebook messages because they go unanswered too.  Delta basically doesn't care to talk to their customers, provide customer service or that they have ruined your plans.   Buyer beware!"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Relationship severed after 25 years,"It was a great ride Delta, but we’re done.  Between allowing screaming children in the 1st class cabin, to lying about weather delays, MEL’s, and sitting on the ramp for 35 minutes causing us to miss our flight home to Orlando, I will never, ever, fly Delta Airlines again.  It’s funny how they use weather as an excuse to not cover anything, and seeing their faces when you call them on it because they get caught by a passenger that knows what an MEL is, and after arguing for the rights of the entire aircraft, they put you into a hotel that is better suited for bed bugs, and roaches, both prevalent throughout the hotel in DTW.  No food vouchers, no apologies from the airline, just bitter nasty employees that do t care about the company they work for, or the passengers they serve."
Date of travel: June 2021,40,Excellent Flight and Service,"I was pleasantly surprised at the large, comfortable seats and leg room. The complimentary snacks and drinks were great. Service on the plane and at the airport was friendly. The downside to this company (and most other large companies) is that the customer service phone number connected me to someone in another country who was not very knowledgeable about the airline and could not help me."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Worst customer service!!,"Seriously the worst airline I’ve ever had to deal with. From the start of this trip it’s been a nightmare getting help. First our flight was delayed out of Portland for over 3 hrs due to mechanical issues, which made us miss our International flight/connection in Minneapolis. We ended up losing a day and a half of our trip in Iceland. Then while in Iceland My mother was in a really bad accident and was in the ICU. I needed to speak with someone to change my flight to come home early. I had to wait for over 3 hrs on the phone to get help. My husband stayed in Iceland to finish out the trip but my mother has taken a decline and now won’t pull through so my husband is trying to get home to be here before she passes. He can not get through to anyone to help, I t’s a 9 HOUR HOLD!! Delta talks about how much they care and how important customer service is but there is ZERO customer service!! I am so disappointed in this airline. The inflight crew and the gate agents were amazing, wish I could say the same about the rest of the airline. When things go bad and you need help, a virtual computer system can not help. Somethings require an actual person to speak to. Do better Delta!"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Bad customer service,"My husband and I recently flew to Anchorage, Alaska to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary. The trip was a once-in-a-lifetime experience and, of course, not everything was perfect, but the trip was memorable.  When we woke up the morning of our flight home-- Anchorage to Minneapolis and Minneapolis to Sioux Falls, SD, we had a notification that our flight was delayed for an hour- which was great as we did some additional sightseeing before dropping the rental car off. We checked in at the airport and made our way through TSA without problems and then sat at our gate. Not long after, the flight was delayed for another hour, and then another hour. At this time, they did announce that there was a problem with the plane and they were working on fixing it. Great, as I would rather they fix the problem prior to my boarding and flying for 4+ hours. And since we had a three+ hour lay-over, we were still good to make our connection. Then came the delay of another hour and a half-- which meant we would not make the connection and so my husband went up to talk with the representative. The rep gave him two $15 vouchers for food and said the hotel would be taken care of in Minneapolis. Not exactly what we'd hoped or expected, but still going with the flow. Delta ended up taking a plane that was scheduled to go to Seattle and finally, we were on our way-- 5 hours after the originally scheduled flight. The flight went great and even though the stewardesses were also thrown a curve-ball as they too would not be going home, but would be spending the night in Minneapolis, they were awesome and had a great attitude. We landed in Minneapolis and debarked and since we had decided the celebration deserved it, we had flown first class and were the first off the plane and the first to the podium.  Here is where everything took a turn.... my husband was up there for a long time and the extra person actually came around and began handing out pre-made vouchers to passengers by name. When all was said-and-done, there were four families that were told, ""Sorry, but we used up all of the allotted rooms so you are on your own."" They were very nice about it, giving us a little over-night package and one even showing us where she would sleep if she ever had to spend the night in the airport. No hotels were recommended and there was No assistance with getting a hotel room and there was definitely No compensation since the hotel that was a DELTA partner was full. Worst experience ever and I will never fly Delta again and I will never recommend Delta to anyone. No one has reached out to us and nothing was done doe these families- one a mother with three kids ranging from a one year old to a teenager."
Date of travel: June 2021,20,Minimal service,"My first international trip since the pandemic.   The service was the absolute bare minimum.   There was a single drink service in 9 hours.  The food was embarrassing, even by airline standards.  ""Breakfast"" was a tiny, greasy ""cinnamon roll"" plus four melon cubes and a single grape.  That kind of ""service"" is worse than none, and indicates the airline's contemptuous attitude towards those of us who travel in the back of the plane.   Delta will blame the pandemic, but my trip also included Air France, KLM, Turkish Airlines, Andaloujet, and Air Moldova.  All of these other airlines managed to provide completely professional and supportive service with meals  even on Andalouget's 90 minute flight.   It's a shame.   I really used to enjoy Delta."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Rude,Fly attendant got handsy with passenger & manager did nothing about it. WOULD NEVER FLY AGAIN! Terrible customer service and does not care about their customers! Money hungry!
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Terrible service,Changes your flight at least 6 times and you pay the same price when you should’ve been refunded the difference.
Date of travel: June 2021,20,Poor Customer Service - Absurd Phone Wait Times,"Seems like every time I call Delta, I end up waiting 30-45 min to speak with a representative. They've recently underrepresented my SkyMiles total by >800% of what it should be, and I cannot get in touch with a representative to get that fixed. Trying to find a clear answer on their website is rather ineffective, and their app sucks. Delta is quickly falling down my list of favorite airlines."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,"7 hours and 59 minutes for a call back, unbelievable","Received an email this morning from Delta telling me my flight has been moved to 6 hours earlier.  I can change to another flight or cancel.  I want to cancel online but there is no option to receive my money back so instead, I need to call the airline.  I put a call in and was informed via the automated voice that I should receive a person calling me back in 7 hours and 59 minutes.  Last week I had to call American Airlines.  It took 3 hours for a return call.  I thought that was unacceptable but today Delta takes the cake!  How can Delta take almost 8 hours to return a call from a passenger! And especially one who purchased a first-class ticket.  I really understand why Americans are gravitating to Southwest.  Delta prides itself on being the business airline but this shows they have serious gaps."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,The Bent-n-Dent of Airlines,"Picture this: you arrive at the airport. You’ve checked out of your hotel, returned your rental car, and you’re ready to take a nice flight home. Well, forget about nice when you’re traveling with Delta! We arrived for our 12:30pm flight only to find (at the airport. Day of.) that we could wait until 10:00pm AND keep our connecting flight, or wait until 4:00pm and then stay overnight to reschedule our connection tomorrow morning. One might ask, how many people did they inconvenience? Our whole flight of 60+ people. How many of those same people were given advance notice? Exactly zero. So now Delta has left their underpaid attendants to deal with all the angry customers whom they inconvenienced with the change in flights. Real professional guys. Overall the experience was a 0/10, and I wouldn’t fly Delta again if I was paid to do so."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,"Will Never fly Delta Again, tried to change flight due to family tragedy","My fiancé and myself flew Business class to Paris on Delta then while in Nice, FR, we received word that my Fiance's Father suddenly passed away.  We tried to contact Delta  to change our flight. Could not change it online do to restrictions.  We called their toll free number for hours, no answer (as of June 28 the wait time was 7 HOURS(Their recording kept saying they were hiring more people soon)We tried for several days but ultimately gave up and booked a one way flight for $1,200 additional on another airline.The only reason we even flew Delta was due to their direct flight from NCE to JFKwhich they cancelled and put us on Airfrance (and Airfrance did answer their phone but couldn't change our flight due to our original booking thru Delta"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Nope,Horrible Checked my carry on.  There was space. Ride about it. Changed gate w out telling us. Almost missed it
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Do Not Take Babies on Delta,"I've flown with Delta many times before and had reasonably good experiences, but that is because I was not flying with a baby. My last two experiences with them have been horrible.First, they don't let you check in online or via the self-service kiosk if you are flying with an infant in arms. The only place we could check in at the SeaTac airport was the Delta customer service counter. There were about 15 people in line in front of us. No big deal, right? Wrong. It took over an hour before we could be helped, and that was because half of those people had given up and gotten out of line. I've spent quite a bit of time looking online since this experience to see if there's an easier way, and Delta's website had nothing helpful for me.Second, we tried to change our Christmas flights 6 months ahead of schedule. Again, because we had an infant listed on one ticket, we could not change our flights online without talking to someone in person. So we tried just buying the tickets we wanted to change to and cancelling our previous ones, only to find out they were non-refundable. I had been led to believe by multiple things on the Delta website that I could cancel or change my Delta flight up to 24 hours in advance (so 6 months shouldn't be a big issue). Thankfully we could cancel the tickets we just bought and get a refund, but we still don't have the actual tickets we wanted.This is easily the worst airline customer service experience I have had in my life. If you are flying with a baby, I would highly recommend looking at another airline (our check-in experience with Alaska was seamless)."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Worst airline ever!,Worst airlines ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My mom was flying to DC unfortunately with delta. We had arrived 2 hours before her flight and ordered a wheelchair for her. The lady at the wheelchair said theres a 20mins wait time.  i had to leave because of work. THEY MADE HER MISS HER FLIGHT BECAUSE OF THEIR INCONSIDERATE UNPROFESSIONAL STAFF!!!! THey said they will put her on next flight which was 8 hours later! She had missed also her dr. Appointment in DC because of this flight delay!I do not recommend delta to anyone!People be ware they have worst staff and worst service possible! DO NOT FLY WITH DELTA!!!
Date of travel: June 2021,20,RUDE COUNTER CLERK,"I usually give Delta 5-stars, but for the first time EVER I was treated rudely and missed a flight from MSP to FWA, for no reason!  I arrived 50 minutes prior to departure, did self check in and pre paid my checked bag.  Headed to hand it off to the clerk at the counter where he proceeded to RUDELY say ""you still have to wait in line""...I am pre checked, bag paid.  I literally had to hand it off to be weighed put on conveyer belt and head to security.  TWENTY FIVE minutes later...I was off to security, then SPRINTING to hit my gate.  Missed my plane by 3 minutes and was charged THREE HUNDRED AND TEN dollars to rebook my flight.  I did receive lovely help from 2 Delta agents once this occurred, and those gals deserve 10 stars helping me rebook.  Was completely shocked by this experience at the counter.  Typically all other Delta employees are AMAZING!  I have NEVER missed a flight in my nearly 48 years on this planet.  It was needlessly missed this time. What is the point of pre pay/Self check if you can't just hand off your bag???????? Very disappointed. Considering booking our bi-yearly vacations through another site instead of using Delta Vacations as we usually do."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Terrible Experience,We scheduled our flights 4 months ago and they have changed each one of them more than 3 times each and we have just arrived in salt lake to fly back to idaho falls (6am) and they moved the flight from 8:40am to 12:48pm. They have changed this flight alone 5 times and are not willing to pay for rental car nor a refund. You should never have flights changed 4 months in advance before they even happen. Terrible service and the workers were rude when we asked for assistance on other flight options.
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Continuous delays,I have been stuck in the airport for almost 24 hours due to the fact that Delta is WAY understaffed. There was mechanical issues with my plane and it has caused continuous delays and no one wanted to help me because they didn't have time. I don't blame anyone for the mechanical issues but things would have went a lot smoother if Delta had more workers. Also the emails they send after the flights are delayed make no sense at all. Also the telephone customer service is awful. Just hire more people!
Date of travel: June 2021,20,Military,"Delta and their partners have NOTHING to do with each other, especially for military personnel and their bags. If you buy a ticket from delta that is operated by their partner Airlines prepare to spend a lot of money on your bags. Delta does not attempt to fix this problem for the people who serve their country well."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Beyond Terrible,We were so excited to book  a family vacation 7 months in advance; and chose Delta for the direct flight option. With the flights being direct we were accepting that the fare chosen was not eligible for upgrades. Our flights were changed 3 times prior to travel dates; and eventually came with stops each way and a 6 hour layover coming home. We were told that there were no other options; only to find out day of that there were seats available on other flights that our fare class didn’t “qualify “ for. Icing”on the cake- monitors for seats in row 18 back did not work. So no in flight entertainment. Crew and pilots great. Delta not so much!! Oh and I haven’t gotten my usual Delta survey. Do they already know/care they failed?!
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Awful customer service.,This is my first time booking a flight to go to a military graduation. I booked us a day short and asked to pay the difference for the extra return date. They said no. I would have to cxl with no refund and re book.   I have no idea what economy basic economy main cabin or any or that means but because we have basic economy they said no changes. Delta  has no respect not even for military families trying to visit their loved ones.
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Worst Telephone Customer Service on Earth!,"Delta’s wait times on their 800 number have gone from a horrible 2-3 hours to an unconscionable 6-8 hours. They should be fined by the federal government for having the worst customer service on the planet. You literally have to go to the airport to get decent service. No that they no longer block the middle seats we are all done with them.Also, they do not permit my wife and I to each use our own Skymiles to upgrade. Ridiculous. Likely a revenue grab to get us to pay to transfer miles between our accounts."
Date of travel: June 2021,40,Fathers Day Flight,"Early morning flight from Milwaukee to Las Vegas with a short layover in Minneapolis.  First aircraft was a regional jet  (Air West Airline?)  with the overheads not big enough to hold our carry on bags.  They checked them at the gate for us for free.  The captain was at the gate check-in and offered a golf cart type vehicle at our layover, as we only had 30 minutes between flights to get us to another gate a long way from our landing gate.  Michael, our flight attendant on our first leg, offered a free drink for fathers as it was Fathers Day.  Nice touch!  Our layover shuttle was waiting for us in Minneapolis and got us to our connecting flight just in time.  Nice costumer service!"
Date of travel: June 2021,40,Good stuff,Delta is great! They are pricy but you get what you Pay for. The airbus we rode on was very nice! Huge. They got people on quickly and gave everyone a sanitizer wipe. The pilot was nice and made me feel very safe and comfortable. Flight was on time and they didn't make any crazy changes to our flights. Not a whole lot of drink or snack options but lots of movies to choose from. My husband's TV was having some issues. Pretty smooth ride and we will always go with delta or jet blue. American airlines is a Mess. Avoid them at all costs!
Date of travel: June 2021,10,What happened to Delta?,"I am an American Express Sky Miles platinum card holder, paying $250 annual fee for absolutely nothing. In the past, cardholders were given priority boarding. Now, I book online and my electronic boarding pass puts me in the basic boarding group. Also, I board the plane and am in row 16. Rows 1 to 15 are comfort plus, and are almost completely empty. I am sitting next to a very nice elderly couple. However, the gentleman takes up considerable space, so I ask to move one row up to the empty row in front of me. I was told those are comfort plus seats and I cannot move. The entire front of the plane is empty with a bunch of cramped passengers in the rear aisles (should call that comfort minus).  I can’t begin to describe how disappointed I am with Delta, this used to be a nice airline to fly with. Instead I will be cancelling my card and will avoid booking with them in the future."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Sad layovers,Arrived in salt lake city for my flight to be leaving for sfo great layover system. Now I'm stuck for 5hours at a airport.
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Worst experience I’ve ever had traveling with an airline,"I flew on delta with my cat and had a 6 hour delay. I paid $125 to take her through the airport. They could have easily predicted the delay but decided to wait until everyone arrived at the airport less than an hour before the flight to tell us that it was delayed. If I had known the flight was going to be delayed, I would have rescheduled the flight because I was traveling with my cat. Delta does not accept emotional support animals anymore so they are essentially discriminating against people with mental illness. I don’t believe I should have to pay the $125 pet fee after she was forced to stay in her carrier for 12+ hours without offering me any options to reschedule for a time she could travel more comfortably and humanely. By the time we got to Boston she defected in her carrier, my boyfriend had to get a hotel for the night because he had to work the next day (he lives 2 hours from the airport). We had to sneak her into the hotel and I had to give her a bath in the hotel bathroom because she was covered in poo. I demand a refund for this inconvenience. I’ve traveled with her many times and she’s never had this issue in the past. Considering we had to spend 150 on a hotel for the night, my boyfriend had to stay up till 5 am on a work night, and I had to spend an hour cleaning up cat poo and giving her a bath, I think we deserve a refund for the inconvenience. Another issue is that delta has the worst customer service I’ve EVER experienced with any airline. I would trade a free movie for decent customer service any day. That’s really all you get out of flying delta. Besides that everything else is a huge inconvenience. Their text support is absolutely useless. I waited 15 hours to get a person on text support but I didn’t see the message for 30 minutes so they ended the chat before I could even start the conversation. I’ve waited on hold for hours trying to reach them about this and the call keeps getting hung up by delta after a few hours of waiting."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Very Rude TSA,"Extremely rude TSA agent, wasn’t happy with the way I was spoken to & handled. I understand the job can be stressful, but was disappointed with the lack of professionalism."
Date of travel: June 2021,20,Poor customer service,"I love Delta as an airline for cleanliness, comfort, & on-time flights. If you have to call them forget about getting a person on the phone.  On hold several occasions for over 4 hours when they stated my hold time was 2 hours.  I attempted messaging and no better.  I give them credit for attempting to accommodate most changes online without an agent, however, sometimes an agent is necessary.  They will lose my loyalty if they don't improve the lack of customer service agents.  I've already taken several flights with other airlines I have overlooked in the past and was very impressed.  I'm thankful we have other options, but hopeful Delta will improve in the future.  Also please bring back meals for first class passengers!"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,customer service,There was an eight hour hold time to talk to an individual!!!!!  Really?  Then they call you back while you are driving and can't answer at that time.  Delta use to be my favorite flight company.  All I wanted to do was talk to an individual regarding seat assignments since I would be traveling with my 3 granddaughters.
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Gone is awesome moved to horrible!,The flight attendants on my last 2 Delta flights were like nazis gone are the days of kind and caring flight attendants.  Delta is the worst offender!
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Terrible customer service.,"I had the worst experience with my ticketing agent. She was so rude, didn’t make any effort to help my situation and I left in tears. I will never fly Delta again."
Date of travel: June 2021,20,"5 hour wait time for customer service, then I get disconnected","Delta Airlines changed my flight to a different airport, inconvenient time with a 4 hour layover. This  flight would cost less, but I wanted something closer to my original plans. I found not make any changes online because I upgraded. THE WAIT TIME FOR DELTA REWARDS MEMBERS IS 5 HOURS.  I wait for hours, then get disconnected!!!"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Zero customer service,Seems Delta are happy to take your money but when it comes to getting any customer service on the phone it's non existent. Can't even call and leave a message. A lazy unhelpful message says 'please call back at a later time!' Of course let's blame covid. No. Get some staff! Answer the dang phone. Previous to trying to book this flight (need to do it on line to use ecredits and AMEX Delta card etc) the wait time was up to 9 hours!! Total joke. Staff up and start to care about your customers.
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Only negative experiences with Delta,"It's hard to write a review based on one experience because I understand that someone can have one negative experience while having many positive ones. At least for me, however, I've only had negative experiences with Delta, whether it's lost baggage, delayed or cancelled flights, or eCredits not working. If you can avoid Delta, it would be advisable."
Date of travel: June 2021,50,Amazing service,"I flew Delta and Frontier for this vacation and Delta hand down wins! There was no competition. I would be embarrassed if I was a owner or a share holder of Frontier. Delta had free carry on, TV's to watch for free and free snacks. Frontier had horrible front desk service, and charged for everything. No TV's and no snack service and limited bottles of water for a purchase of $2.99."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,The world’s worst airline,"Pilot frantic and panicky, gate staff spacey and incompetent, attendants hateful and ungroomed. 0/10. Will never use again. Do yourself and don’t fly delta. Take out a life insurance policy if you do. Seriously, you’re better off walking."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,"Welcome Back, Delta!","Here's our feedback to Delta on last night's flight:CommentLet's start with system not being able to locate ticket #0062456082986... . PHX to DTW leg of our trip was one of the worst on Delta in last 15 years of travel, starting with trying to provide feedback for multiple issues with poorly designed survey tool. First, lack of sanitation stations in PHX is inexcusable - had to constantly look around for them, should be ubiquitous at this point of our shared COVID lives. Got to waiting area of F12 and sat with discontented dog and its owner, who barked at things, other dogs and people multiple times. This happened to us once, when our animal barked a single time after being startled by a rattling wheelchair going past and were threatened to not allow her to board - is this standard based on the appearance of affluence - or skin color? Certainly not based on amount of commotion caused in this experience. Flight was late, which was strangely predicted hours ahead of time, and schedule changed, then blamed on plane not being cleaned on time. Late is late, cleaning had nothing to do with it getting to PHX behind time, but could have contributed to added more time delay on. Masking requirements have been relaxed since our last flight 12/31/20 - all manner of things tied around people necks, some of them actual masks. Should be over this by now, in our opinion. Service on flight was cut short by rough weather and was a bare minimum - drink and choice of either cookie or bag of nuts - really? For $1200, didn't expect a five star diner, but 12 almonds didn't seem like we got our money's worth. Perhaps most upsetting, was during our rocky descent, attendant came up from behind with some mobile looking device and (I think) asked me to confirm my identity. It appeared to my wife and myself that someone might be desperately trying to contact us, but it was impossible to determine what the attendant was trying to communicate with background noise, earphone inserted and delivery. Would have noticed the concern and lack of comprehension on my face (if I didn't have mask) and only after they moved on to passenger ahead of me did we realize it was some form of marketing on Delta's part. DON'T DO THIS! Nobody looking to be approached on plane with attendant with phone looking for you unless it IS an emergency. Late flight impacted dozens of passengers, which attendants attempted to address broadly - certainly felt sorry for them flying Delta. Appreciated suggestion they made to let these folks off first, but frustrated to learn they had to call a manager over to operate Jetway because there was nobody available to operate it. As travel has become more seemless than ever, this flight was memorable for all of its shortcomings. Good luck unpacking this information and getting it into the hands of people who can action it, out guess is it won't. Welcome Back, Delta!"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Worst customer service over ever received.,My flight got delayed in salt lake meaning I was going to miss my connecting flight in Atlanta. The guy running the gate told me well you need to run to your next gate instead of offering me any kind of assistance. I’m in the military and I was traveling for training in California. I’m coming home to see my wife and I basically get told oh well sucks to suck. So now I’m staying the night in Atlanta which is no big deal but the hotel they put me in is 30 mins from the airport and didn’t have a shuttle like the customer service rep at delta told me they would. All making this trip even better. I had paid for an upgrade to first class and I’m not getting comped my money or miles for that seat I missed through no fault of my own. The entire time this was going on my wife was on hold for over 4 hours trying to figure something out for me but still never ended up getting any actual help. I’m never flying delta again.
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Harrassed by Flight Attendant and then black listed,"Heading home from family vacation on the red eye with a connection in JFK. Attendant was rude, unprofessional, loud and angry. She repeatedly berated my son to wear his gator mask in spite of him eating or sleeping. Awakened from my sleep at 2:30am on a flight with many empty seats, I heard her attacking someone. I woke up to see and it was my son again sitting in a different seat sleeping with no one around him (see photo). I stopped her to tell her that was my son she was harassing.  I took her name Cee. Within 30 min, she came now to attack me even though I was eating grapes..telling me she was watching me and I wasn't eating.  She was argumentative.  She then asked me for my name and said if I don't wear the mask I will not make my connecting flight. She accused me of saying something to someone and I asked her to please repeat because I didn't hear what she was accusing me of.  She said it again and I still didn't understand.  She rudely walked away. I put my mask on while eating grapes for the remainder of the flight and my son did the same. Cee was waiting by the cockpit and told me to go with the three Passenger Assistant Services staff. The was escorted of the plane like a criminal and advised to go to the desk to meet with them.Neela was very nice and refunded my ticket She apologized saying there was nothing she could do but I was not allowed to continue on the connecting flight AND no longer able to fly Delta for my lifetime. Mortified and deeply disgusted with their services. My husband had no clue what was going on and said he had a complaint about a rude flight attendant and explained his story. Then our son spoke out, our other son and our daughter. They all witnessed her abusive behavior.So, I was left at JFK from 930am -6:00pm to get a flight on another airline. I am a medical professional and was treated like a criminal and blacklisted because I asked for her name since she was harassing my son.I have escalated this to the executive level and look forward to speaking with them and being compensated for the extreme humiliation, embarrassment and inconvenience for delay in travel.Employees like Cee and her two other attendants are harmful for Delta Airlines and I pray they will be addressed for their unprofessional service."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,"Thieves, liars and contract breachers!","Booked flight through Expedia who booked me through Delta. Delta quickly cancelled one of my connection flights so i cancelled. Kept my money for three months and at no point planned on refunding it. Expedia pawned me off on Delta who pretended claimed they had to take another 30 days to process a refund on a booking contract THEY BREACHED! These people lie, steal and mislead constantly and I wouldn't wish them upon my worst enemy! 4 months later and still waiting for a refund! Avoid them like COVID 19!"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,If you have children never fly this airline,"Run from this airline if you have children.  Customer service is available after 2-3 hours so be sure you won't have any questions regarding flight, and your kids.  Our 2 year old was put on a flight by himself???  We tried calling in and took almost 4 days to get flights updated.  They tried to charge us but we had booked ticket during covid flex time.  My wife and I have spent almost 40 hours trying to change this flight, it's not only cost us time, but money.  With 5 kids we will never fly delta again.  Executives for this company should be embarrassed."

Well, the next day, I spent almost the whole day there at the  airline office and the guy that was helping me with the fight asked for $350, which he demanded or else I would be stuck in Accra. .

Date of travel: March 2021,50,First time flying-great experience,"Delta is the only carrier that flies into Rhinelander, WI.  Masks were required and to social distance they loaded from the back to the front of the plane.  I sat in the middle section of the plane in economy and the middle two seats were blocked out.  Snacks were served in ziplock bags and extra small bottled water were given if asked for.Flights were on time and our flight attendants great"
Date of travel: June 2021,30,Rough trip,This flight was full of aggressive people and flight attendants were pretty hands off. The return flight was cramped. Overall both directions were something I hope never to do again. I would think twice about flying delta again.  Have had much better experiences on Jet Blue.
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Never Delta again!! “Zero” stars if possible,"Worse airline!!! Twice in a row they had problems with their planes. When we travel from Redmond to JFK we lost half a day waiting for them to find a part for the plane. When we travel back eventhough we tried to check in in time they wouldn’t let us in so we missed our flight. Spend the night in a hotel near the airport so we can catch the next morning flight, they charged us $26 for rebooking. Now we’re on the plane and again problem with the AC and air filtration system .

Date of travel: June 2021,20,What happened to Delta?,"We have always flown Delta, First Class.  This was the worst experience from start to finish.  The security at JFK was unorganized and took forever that we couldn't enjoy the Sky Club.  We were all starving, but anticipated a meal on board since we were flying First Class.  We never received a meal, but were offered what I referred to as a kid's ""Happy Birthday Loot bag.""  We could choose between two boxes of snacks which included cheese and crackers, almonds, Oreo's beef jerky, etc. You get my drift.  A bunch of sweet and salty snacks after paying for First Class. My husband had to go ask for headphones, and we never received a drink until well on our way.  I was so disappointed.  Change  your prices if you are going to change  your service."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,The worst!,Got up at 4 AM. We arrived with what should have been plenty of time- waited in line FOREVER.  We were then told- sorry we can't get you onto the plane. The clerk refused to talk with us and handed us new tickets for a midnight arrival ( we expected to get there at 9 AM). Looked it up on the computer- tons of earlier flights with available tickets that she could have put us on instead. And an 8 HOUR wait to talk to someone on the phone.
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Terrible on all fronts,"I am amazed at how bad Delta's service has become. My wife and I purchased business class tickets. By the time our check in email arrived, her seat had been downgraded to cabin. No explanation, nothing. They simply do this to their customers, and we are supposed to simply accept it? Reaching an agent took over three hours (yes, three!), which clearly indicates that their customer service operation is about anything but their customers. We will be filing a formal complaint with the Department of Transportation."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Bad service.,Well was not able to use my credit I got from last summer bc of covid. Couldn’t use my credit bc no one would take my call. Booked flight at full price. Paid for seat upgrades. Now on hold for 4 hours bc they moved my seat and want to charge me again for same seat upgrade I already paid for. Terrible customer service. Waste of time.
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Rude,"Worst experience at the gate. First time flying in delta. I usually take American Airlines. Never again will I ever fly with these people. Flight ticket said boarding time was 5:30, I get to the gate B8 at 5:45 which means 15 minutes late. I ask the flight attendant in B8 if the flight was still boarding and he completely ignores me. He continues to ignore me without giving me a hand gesture or anything. He then removes the microphone from his mouth to tell his coworker he’s never experienced this in his life and insults me infront of his coworkers. He had a face mask on and his hand covered the microphone completely which was not noticeable he was on the microphone. He could’ve advised me or his coworker next to him could’ve told me he was on the microphone instead of making fun of me and mocking me. Then at boarding they threaten my husband we will be kicked out because we let them known how rude they treated us."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Garbage timing on their part that ruins everyone’s life.,Absolute garbage. They were real late getting to the airport so then we ran to our next spot and missed at by 5 seconds and they wouldn’t let us on. Don’t fly delta
Date of travel: June 2021,10,WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!!!!!,"Not shocked because i said this on the way down as well. I NEVER NEVER NEVER want to fly Delta Air Lines again. I’ve had by far the WORST EXPERIENCE ever on ALL FOUR of these flights. Not to mention it was SUPPOSED TO BE a non stop originally and then they changed it on us. This has been AWFUL!!!!!! The customer service is TERRIBLE!!!!!! EVERY SINGLE delta employee i have had to interact with on this trip has been beyond RUDE!!! They’ve made me be stand by because of THEIR ERROR. They made it seem like i was going to be stuck because they told me they didn’t know if they had a seat for me because the ones available weren’t the same as i purchased??? yet this was their error because they updated my first flight but not my second, all while they had my entire family board without me. Talk about anxiety attack. I was all alone and terrified i was going to be stuck and the employees did not make things any better AT ALL!!! They were nasty and rude about the whole thing. I was literally crying and the lady said “I’ll let you know” and told my family they needed to go and leave me. I thought maybe after the first TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE on the way down I’d have a better experience on the way back and honestly it’s been even worse this trip. I honestly can’t even believe this. I will NEVER TAKE ANOTHER Delta flight again. Mind you this isn’t even my cousins terrible experience on this trip, i only shared mine. I am so disappointed."

It is currently 12 a.m. June 14 and I've yet to board the plane.A terrible situation for everyone indeed, but the communication between staff and passengers about the absurd waste of time and money inflicted upon 100+ people was too little, too late and hardly reassuring. The $15 meal vouchers provided were practically insulting as the only restaurants available at the time they were distributed were closing or already closed. Hideously understaffed on a weekend overall.Fingers crossed the hotel accommodations they promised my family aren't as poorly handled as the flight itself, assuming it even happens!People are stranded, many of whom are traveling with small children. ""Inconvenient"" is a grotesque understatement.F*ck Delta."

Absolutely appalling- fly any other airline then delta pretty much !! I will never fly delta again
Date of travel: May 2021,10,"Lots of potential, tarnished by shameful behavior.","I submitted a complaint that clearly warranted action from the airline, and have given them over 4 weeks to reply, hence I am going to multiple forums to share my experience. The following is a copy-paste original piece clearly brushed off by Delta Airlines. To whom this may concern, the following is my experience regarding my trip from Denver, CO to the island of Sint Maarten on May 3rd, 2021. My initial flight was lovely, however I when I landed in Atlanta, GA for my layover I arrived at 12:00 am in an absolutely empty Atlanta airport. Not a single soul was in my concourse, I was completely alone. Now I understand under the current circumstances with the pandemic the first class lounge remains closed during late hours. Nonetheless, I sat in that airport for 7 hours waiting for the lounge to open up at 7:00 am, and I cannot emphasize nor deliberate how run down this concourse was. Seats were falling apart, outlets were a joke, and there was nothing at all to eat, or drink for 7 hours. The previous flight gave me a some upscale snacks, but that was it. I know that this is uncontrollable by the airline, but this simply serves to paint the picture of my situation. At 7:00 am, I walk into the lounge and stand in line at the counter. Please keep in mind, I have changed at this point, and was in my leisure outfit. When I get the counter, I met a gentleman that clearly ""read"" my appearance, and already decided I did not belong in the lounge. Regardless, I booked a first class flight in anticipation of overnight travel and yet when I spoke with him, he reminded me of some silly policy. Apparently flights to the Caribbean or Mexico do not have Delta 1 on the airplanes sent there, and thus I was illegible. So my question to you is, who's fault is that? All I know is, I spent almost 900 dollars on a one way flight, comforted by the fact that I was flying Delta, who are known for their service. One walk of shame later from that counter, I was wronged and your reputation tarnished. At the very least, one would expect you to make this policy well known before another individual like myself books an overnight flight in such a rundown airport like Atlanta.  At 9:30 am, I boarded my flight and we then moved on to sit on the tarmac for 3 hours. Apparently there was an issue related to the windows of the cockpit of plane, and thus we deplaned at 12:30 pm. 3 hours later, we boarded again, took off at 4 pm, and the staff did a phenomenal job. I could not have been more thrilled with them and their attitude. To summarize, I took me over 28 hours to arrive to my destination, in an entirely hellish fashion. I had high but reasonable expectations of your airline, and you treated me with utter disrespect. I am a medical student, and I have had to answer to multiple people for my delay, and have yet to make up missed commitments. And for this experience, I was rewarded $275 in mileage, as though expecting me to fly with the airline again. I am a very tolerant individual, but all things considered, judgements included, I believe further action is required of you. I am grateful for the corporate sentiment, but frankly speaking it feels as though my experience was a joke brushed off as unimportant.  I have been besides myself for not have writing to you earlier, but again I am a student, with other much more important responsibilities than submitting a complaint to a veteran airline. Nonetheless I demand respect, and to be treated with dignity."

My MAJOR complaint is with the seats, I paid extra for were SO uncomfortable I landed and had back pain for the next 3 days. IF I would have had a more comfortable seat (Without paying 1st class fares) I would give this trip 5 stars,"
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Dishonesty at its finest!,"Writing this review to express my disgust at the dishonesty of this airline.  In April of 2020, during the COVID pandemic I booked a flight for a family wedding.  When I booked the flight Delta had a ""flight special"" that offered up tickets at a very inexpensive price and also they stated that if the flight had to be cancelled the original ticket price would be honored at face value with no fees or increase in ticket price.  When I booked the flight, I confirmed this offer with the Delta Rep and would not have booked the flight had this not been the case. In May of 2020 the flight had to be cancelled and when I attempted to call Delta Customer service I was placed on hold for 3 hours.  Over the course of the next few days I continued to make attempts to contact Delta only to find wait times were 3 to 4 hours or more.  Due to this, I contacted Delta through Facebook Messenger.  I received a message back from Patrick cancelling the flight, and at that time I was able to confirm with Patrick in writing that in fact yes that the flight  could be rebooked at a later date with the original ticket price being honored and that I there would be an ""even exchange"" when I went to re-book the flight. In 2021 with the wedding back on I attempted to book the flight only to find that the e-codes provided were invalid.  I then called the booking  number to then be told that in fact that no my tickets would not be honored unless I paid the current fee, which was more than $300.00 more than the original price I had paid for the tickets - this despite the fact that I had it in writing that the original ticket price would be honored as an ""even exchange"". The booking agent stated I would have to call customer service in order to lodge a complaint.After several days of waiting on hold for three hours or more I finally gave up and filed a complaint with the Department of Transportation.  DOT passed my complaint on to Delta who basically responded that they would not honor their promise to honor the ticket price.  So essentially they lied to me and in all probability lied to other trusting customers as well.So...buyer beware.  This is a company that uses dishonesty as its best policy as a means of scamming customers."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Allianz Travel Assistance Provided By Delta Airlines Is A Sham,"When making flight arrangements to Gulfport for a chartered fishing trip from the area, I purchased Allianz Travel Assistance (Insurance).  When I had to cancel my flight arrangements due to bad weather (28mph winds and 8-10 foot waves), with a small craft directive from the Coast Guard, I thought I was covered.  Allianz requested documentation, which I immediately provided.  They advised that the claim would take about ten days to process.  After repeatedly contacting them by email, they advised after three weeks time that my claim was cancelled.  I strongly recommend to all who read this review, and especially sportsman, to think twice about wasting money on insurance from this company.  It is like buying a ""panic button"" at a novelty store.  It might make you feel better, but it is only providing you a false sense of security.  Their assurance that they provide is that they will process your credit card."

Date of travel: June 2021,10,Delta Fails to Provide First Class,Have been a top tier flier on Delta as have two others in my family.  Decided to try Delta instead of JetBlue Mint.  Terrible decision.  No comparison.  Delta used to fly a 320 and now have downgraded to an older 737. Delta’s seats were inferior by a large margin and every seat was filled. The price was almost the same.  The food for two 6 1/2 hour flights was a terrible snack box compared with JetBlue’s full service dinner.  The return trip arrived at 12.30 am instead of 10pm due to nothing other than waiting for a connecting flight into LAX which had passengers scheduled to fly on this flight.  The only positive note was the flight attendants.  Delta has downgraded its service and if you pay $1500 then you should expect at least competitive service.  So JetBlue Mint gets an A+ and Delta First gets a C-
Date of travel: June 2021,30,The WORST experience  with DELTA VACATIONS,"This is the first and last time we would ever book through Delta vacations and would caution everyone out there to think twice before doing so.Three days before the day of departure I was left with a voicemail saying that our vacation has been cancelled. We (my niece and my BIL who were travelling with us) all tried to call the only ONE number that they have available and were kept on hold for hours and then when I finally got someone on the line after holding for almost 3 hours, we are told that we have been moved to a different hotel.  At the airport my niece is told she has to pay for her luggage even though our first bags were checked in for free so she ended up paying a total of $260. Even after paying for her luggage, she did not get one bag which came in the next flight. There is no guidance or help whatsoever to tell us how we would get transferred to the hotel. Thanks to my niece who had taken the time to do some research to see where we would find the shuttle to take us to the hotel (we were expecting someone to be there holding a placard with our name on it). Same with our return flight, there was no communication sent out to us to tell us what time we will be picked up. We got a phone call from the reception at 10:30 that there was a car waiting to take us to the airport. Our flight was at 2:45p.m. and we were expecting to leave at 11:30 since the airport was only 15 mins away and would be at the airport by latest 12:00. I came down to tell the person who had come to pick us up to wait until 11:30 as we were not expecting him to be there at that time and needed time to get ready. When we came down at 11:15, we found the person had left without notifying us. We had to take 2 taxis for which we had to pay as well (a total amount of & 70) which my niece claimed but they paid it not in cash/check but credit that can only be used against Delta vacations!! Why would we want to use them EVER again after this horrible experience?!?!Horrible communication and customer service."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,The worst experience in my life,"It came as a surprise to me that a disgusting malevolent attitude towards me at the front desk from a man working there came as a surprise.  It is extremely rare to find such a contemptuous and disrespectful person and undisguised disgust on your face.  I am a young woman, my weight is 46 kilograms.  I cannot lift my suitcase weighing more than 100 kilograms on my own.  I'm not at the World Bodybuilding Championships, I just came to the airport alone and needed some help.  This check-in counter is for 1st class passengers, but the attitude towards me as a passenger was such that I felt like a scum of society!  For 5 minutes I persuaded this huge man to help lift my suitcase 100 kilograms, but he refused me with contempt on his face.  Seriously!??  And this is a special counter for 1st class passengers ???  For those willing to pay for comfort?  Is this why people work and then spend their money?  To be treated like that ???  No other airline in the world, even at the economy class counter, makes people feel so helpless !!!  This employee is not allowed by the rules to pick up my suitcase, as I understand it?  WHAT SHOULD I DO IF I AM NOT PHYSICAL STRONG ????  What is this discrimination ???  Where is the human attitude ???  Personally, I will never fly again with Delta!  I'd rather fly with other airlines that have never had such problems.  In the end, this employee never helped me with my suitcases, although he had no other business, because the first class check-in counter is always free!  In the end, a passing man helped me!  Otherwise, I don't know how long I would have had to stand there helpless and despair !!!!  If you cannot help your passengers, then at least explain to your employees so that they can offer some alternative option !!!!  Instead of standing and humiliating passengers and feeling them unwanted and flawed !!!!  I sincerely hope that one day this man will experience physical disabilities !!!!"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Christian not very Christian !,"Aboard delta flight to boston I received numerous threats and uncomfortable accusations Christian a Hispanic male yells at me I said I’m prego he says I don’t care I said I had no attitude I was told to move to my seat which was one seat ahead I placed my bag over the top to be placed at my window seat ! The plane was not in motion at all and I was making safety calls to alert my family of my arrival a Caucasian women complained I was making a call and did say what’s the issue and Christian said calm my attitude I said would if you and the other five people would stop attacking me verbally and with his hands flapping in the air . This same lady once I choose to voice to text decided to wave down the same person again to complain about voice to text , I’m assuming she’s not a fan of African Americans because there were over two dozen other people making calls as well and for me to be the only harassed I was totally discriminated against ! They stressed out myself and my unborn child buy attacking me publicly personally I have flown many airlines and have never had issues delta has officially convinced me not to fly with them due to there lack of empathy, my mask was on my calls weren’t loud but I was harassed by the lady in seat 29/ D/E both her and her spouse made my flight uncomfortable along with the flight attendant he even ended the convo with besitos in Spanish that means kisses so he was extremely passive aggressive toward me and. Made the situation worse . When I try to apologize he threatened me with “I’ll put you on another flight, let’s see threats harassment and discrimination all on one two hour flight delta should be ashamed of themselves ."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Worst Delta Experience EVER,"Going for my Fathewr's funeral. Need to take my small dog. Required to call Customer Service for the in cabin pet. OVER 8 HOURS WAITING ON THE PHONE. 6 ATTEMPTED CHATS UNANSWERED, 10 SURVEYS and..... NOTHING STILL. Once Delta was my favorite airline. NEVER AGAIN.!!! THIS IS UNFORGIVABLE. Outsourcing phone reps to India when Americans are in need of jobs. FOR SHAME. REPREHENSIBLE. DISGUSTING. EXPENSIVE. HORRIBLE. Worst booking experience EVER . I paid obver $800 for this. DELTA apparently operates out of Mumbai and all their workers are out sick or dead,. Delta went from BEST to ABSOLUTE WORST... and as of this moment I am STILL ON HOLD!"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Flight delayed 5 tines,Flight delayed 5 times.  I could of just booked a flight with another airline with all the time I spent doing nothing.  Worst airline ever.  Don’t waste your time with delta just book a flight with a better airline
Date of travel: June 2021,30,Plane was hot: air vents blew almost nothing,"On both my flights, the one two Mexico City from JFK and the one returning to JFK, the planes were very hot. The air vents blew almost no air. In the past when you left your vent fully open you felt the air blow on you, and often after being in the air for a while you had to cut it back. In addition, when we landed in New York City, there was no air circulation at all on the plane while people were getting off. The flight back was officially an Aeromexico flight and they choreograph deplaning, which seemed to take even longer than normal deplaning.  The heat and lack of air circulation are not just uncomfortable but now they are a health hazard. I am not happy that I have two more major trips booked with Delta at this time."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,8 Hours waiting time on Customer Service Phone,"To change the flight reservation Delta ask their customers to wait stunning 8 hours on the customer „service „ phone, the worst customer service ever experienced"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Will change your flight dates without an apology,"In May, I reserved my flight for an international trip. My trip is scheduled for September. I hardly take trips, so I opted for a more expensive ticket (Comfort), because I'm not ready for First Class yet. However, I want to be comfortable on a long trip . I understood that I couldn't cancel after 24 hours of reservation, so I had to commit to the Comfort and trust that I deserve the experience. Yesterday, I received a notification that my flight had been changed. Delta didn't just change the time, they changed the dates of our trip to arrive a day earlier and depart a day later than our plans. Thus, extending our trip from a 5-day to a 7-day travel, in another country... Yes! this is an international trip. I haven't been on an international trip since 2001!!! I planned my childcare, work/appointments and arrangements on this trip. So imagine my nerves of an impromptu change. I called Delta. The line said it'll be a 30 minute wait for the next available representative. It was 8:00 am.  I selected the callback option...I didn't get a callback until 9:20...The rep looked up the details and basically explained that no concessions can be made for the inconvenience. However, we could cancel our trips and get a refund if we like. Here's the issue: The company made changes to a reservation for a flight that an agent sold to me. I reserved mine with a Delta agent directly.  Then, we get a notification that states Delta changed it. They didn't ask, give options or anything. This is my first time in Mexico. Our flight schedules  were solely made based on the accommodations we had for this trip. Now, Delta extends the trip and I have to figure everything else out. We either have to pay for 2 extra days of accommodations,  in Mexico, or cancel our trip and HOPE they give us our money back- NOT IN CREDIT. Would you feel comfortable with someone forcing you to stay somewhere longer than you intended and making you pay for it?This is not COMFORTable at all."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Just terrible,Flight left early as I ran through the terminal. Gave me a ticket for the following day. Cost me thousands. I will never fly delta again. This is their hub and they still can't manage to fly on schedule. Trash airline.
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Three hrs phone wait,How in God's green earth can you make your customers wait 3 darn hours to speak with a rep. That is insane. And why is there no info ANYWHERE on your website to buy a boarding pass for my emotional support 2 pd dog. And why if I pay full price for my 2 pd pet does she not get a seat?HOW CAN YOU MAKE PEOPLE WAIT THREE HOURS ON THE PHONE UNACCEPTABLE
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Lipstick on a pig,"They act nice and classy...but after 8 delays they were kind enough to notify us too late that we wouldn't get our flights today.   Then down graded our seats and offered a swell flight tomorrow that caused us to lose work days.Oh ...and no hotel.  Delta is a dishonest, garbage airline.  I will not fly here again.   I can get treated like crap on any airline.  Why pay extra for their junk.  Congrats, last dollar ill ever spend with this zero integrity company."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Do Not Fly Delta,Absolutley atrocious. I had a simple checked luggage that I paid for. And Delta could not manage to put it on the plane. Then when I got to JFK. They told me it would come later. After my next flight left. So I could not check it on my flight to Montenegro. So Delta promised they would send it on its way. They made a report  to act as if they were actually doing something. But in reality they never did anything. They never attempted to even contact me. Every time I called them because they certainly werent going to call me. They would tell me they are sorry and to just file a claim. They didnt even know where Montenegro was. Curious for an international airline. I went through the laborious process of justifying my claim. And still no one has contacted me. This is awful customer service. How incompentent and innefective Delta is.
Date of travel: June 2021,10,More people need to be honest,More people need to be honest about this review and the wait time.  You all need to fix this problem.
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Online chat,I have also tried to contact you via the app and was told once again higher than normal contact volumes.  I find this to be the most horrible customer service ever.  I have never had such an experience.
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Split Family up on Different Flights,"My wife booked a flight for herself and our three daughters on Delta in May. They changed her flight, but not our daughters. She didn't realize this until she arrived at the airport and was told by a Delta employee that he couldn't check her bags because she wasn't booked on the same flight as our girls. The flight they had booked her on had already departed. There's absolutely no excuse for this. Families should never be split up onto different flights without approval."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Customer service is horrid.  I have been waiting for a week for an update on my flight change.,Customer service is horrid.  I have been waiting for a week for an update on my flight change.  I have tried four different times to contact and at least a 4 hour wait.  I have been hold this time for 1 hour.
Date of travel: June 2021,10,terrible customer service,"I have had 2 trips with more than poor service from delta back to back. the first was when got delayed and then sat in a hot plane on the tarmac for 3 hours just for us to return to the terminal when the pilots had informed us that they ran out of flight time and can no longer fly, then being told that it was going to be 4 more hours until they had another pilot available.The second trip went bad when I booked in advance paid for the premium seats all in a row so I could be with my family only to have them re-book the flight at the last min and scatter us around the new plane. I preceded to try to contact delta and was greeted with the customer service that they call great! I messaged them in the app, on the website, on twitter, and on the phone (over 6 hour wait on hold! before I gave up) nothing worked, I couldn't even make my own changes due to a website ""Error"" completely unacceptable."
Date of travel: May 2021,50,Great Flight,"Very nice flight from Boston to Ft Lauderdale.  On time, amazing service in the FC cabin.  Seating was great and especially liked the large video screen.  I appreciate live TV and wish Delta would provide free internet.  The Bistro Box they offered was ok, fun to try the different items."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Why a root canal during a prison rape would be better than flying Delta.,"The WORST airline EVER. Arriving at KEF in Iceland for a flight to JFK we were approached by “Delta Security Staff” as was everyone in line. They demanded documents then the answers to a string of seemingly pointless questions including how many people in your department at work, what the building looks like and how long you have lived at your present address. Each answer was met with stares into the eyes and long review of passports, as though any of that information was contained therein. I have travelled the world as a documentary cameraman including the Eastern Block and Africa, often carrying Carnet de Passage, and customs documents for gear, but this flight walking through from vacation with only a carry on was by far the worst customer service experience of my life. The interrogator was brash and at one point stated “I will ask the questions and you will answer them” . At the gate I was selected for further screening including my socks, emptying all my bags, pockets and nearly my bowels. I’ve had less invasive colonoscopies.  Had I not needed to get to my destination on time I would have left and booked a flight with another carrier. Rest assured that I will never fly Delta again to any destination and will at every opportunity elaborate on the terrible customer service and rude staff provided by Delta. Without question the absolute worse customer service in the industry, you make Aeroflot look like cheerleaders.  AVOID THE AIRLINE AT ALL COSTS. Take connecting flights through other countries if necessary, walk, swim through broken glass, but at all costs avoid ever flying Delta."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Horrible experience/ horrible customer service,My trip to Bonaire was canceled because of covid and I was given e-credits. I was fine with that because I’ve always enjoyed Delta. Now I’m trying to rebook my flight and they are charging almost $1000 more than other airlines! That is ridiculous! I also tried to get my money back and they want to charge a $300 service fee!
Date of travel: May 2021,50,😁,"My first time flying and I went with Delta it was an amazing experience the plane was clean the ride was smooth and the staff was great DEBRA was amazing kind, attentive, funny. What made it even better  it was my daughter first time flying as well and she got a picture in the front of the plane with the pilot how cool is that thanks DELTA for amazing experience!!!"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,It was the worst flight experience of 30 years of travel!!,"This was the worst flight experience I've ever had in 30 years of air travel.  The staff on both flights, the older flight attendant on DL2364 was so nasty to us.  I own medical practices across the country.  I'm very familiar with Covid 19 and the risks of this disease, but Delta's promise to be kind to us regarding our masks was shattered by this flight attendant's demeanor and attitude.  I get that times are hard, but there are more ways to ask us to adjust a mask than snapping at your passengers in a harsh tone of voice over and over again.  In your welcome video, you gave us the rules and promised to be nice to us when you reminded us, and that just didn't happen. I thought it may have just been me, or a bad day, but when I asked my wife, she agreed that it was AWFUL!!  As we were being transported to the airport the other travelers had the same experience and we all discussed it.  One name kept coming up among the group, ""Mask Nazi"" was the term I heard over and over to describe this flight attendant. :(   This isn't how travel is supposed to be, and for God's sake, we should never have to pay for this!!I'm guessing that the crew was exhausted and maybe that's why most of them on our second flight DL1900 just couldn't be bothered to be kind to us.  Teva, the attendant in the front of the plane was kind and the lady who was at the counter in Indianapolis was, but everyone else acted like we were more of a nuisance than paying customers.  If the flight had been free I might have been OK with the experience, but it wasn't!!  I had to pay for this, and I'm not sure I'm willing to trust my money with Delta again.  You were my preferred airline, but this was so awful.  I'm not sure I will choose you again."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Delta attendants treated passengers unfairly with dogs.,"My flight is DL 1389 from SLC to BOS. I booked my seat number 21F, but the Delta employee changed my seat to 16A even-though I did not ask for the changing. Unfortunately, next to my seat is a big dog, and the dog owner let the dog came up on the seat and breathing to my face. I don’t know if the dog has covid or any contagious diseases. I didn’t feel comfortable with the dog, so I asked to change my seat back to the original one 21F, which is the window seat. But the Delta employees said that “your seat is changed, and you don’t feel comfortable to sit next to the dog, so you have to sit any available seat.” They force me have to accept the other uncomfortable seat or I have to sit next to the big dog. They changed my seat from original comfortable to uncomfortable. I paid $40 more for the service that I can change my seat to a better seat. But they changed my seat again and again to the worse ones instead. I have asthma, and I allergic to animals fur, but they don’t care, and they treated an animal better than a human. They moved me instead of the dog.After that, 2 of the Delta employees treated me differently. I said “thank you” to the one who served me with trash picking up, but she didn’t say “you are welcome” to me as she did to everyone else. Another one spoke to me rudely “step here!” while I was waiting to go to restroom. They rude to me and treated me different just because I don’t feel comfortable with the dog! What is the humanity like that? Do I have to love things that they love? Where is my freedom? Where is my right?How people think about those Delta employees service and attitude such like this?This cause my depression, and I worry if it happens again on my next trip."
Date of travel: June 2021,20,No Flexibility & Painfully Long Wait Times,"I've been a very loyal, long-time customer of Delta and recently had a change to a business trip so I needed to adjust my travel dates. Unfortunately, due to company restrictions with the pandemic I had to purchase a Basic Economy ticket. After waiting on hold for FOUR AND A HALF HOURS I was met with a simple ""no"" and absolutely no sympathy or understanding for my situation. The ""supervisor"" told me that my fee would be the $450 ticket that I had already purchased even though the new ticket I was going to purchase was over $650. Seems a little outrageous to me. I've always had great customer service in the past but will no longer be choosing Delta as my preferred airline in the future."
Date of travel: May 2021,30,"Supposedly packed flight, no longer any social distancing.","Basically no problems. However again by flying economy, one has no rights to select a seat without incurring exorbitant fees to do so in advance. They assign it. Once again, I was assigned a center seat in row 41.  At the gate, I asked again for an aisle or window seat. I was given an aisle seat, but it was in row 45, back, back of the plane.  Once everyone was boarded, I found that I had 3 seats to myself! The lady across the aisle from me had the same. This improved the comfort greatly."
Date of travel: April 2021,30,"Flying is never any fun, anymore.","Flew April 30, 2021 to attend a funeral for my brother in Florida. Covid social distancing in effect, so center seats were mostly left unoccupied, except they assigned me a CENTER SEAT. Flying economy one has no rights to choose or select in advance, it is assigned! At the gate, I was able to get an aisle seat. Mask wearing mandatory, but all remove them for drinking or eating, so what is the point? Fee non-alcohol beverages and a small cookie or pretzel bag.  In flight I learned that social distancing would no longer be in effect the next day, so on my return flight all seats could be filled. OH JOY! Arrival notes- we arrived at Ft. Lauderdale Airport, Terminal 2. Our rental vehicle was to be picked up at Terminal 1. We were told to take the shuttle to Terminal 1. However there were about 75 people wanting to take that shuttle (only one every 15 minutes or so) and only 16 people allowed per shuttle bus. At that rate we would be waiting for over an hour to board. Being the street at the terminal is a one way, the shuttle bus has to go all the way around to the right (a couple miles) to get to Terminal 1 which was right next to Terminal 2 on the left. We opted to drag our luggage about 1/4 mile and walk there."
Date of travel: June 2021,20,Costly change by Delta,"Our return home was changed by Delta so that we had over a 3-hr layover. We specifically picked our flight for the short flight time of 4-hrs. When I called to make adjustments, I was told I would need to pay the fare difference of $300/ ticket= $900! Much larger than the original ticket price. This is a nice money-making scheme by Delta which we don’t appreciate. Delta had nothing to offer us except a large price increase for a change DELTA made. We are not pleased"
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Delta handles logistics poorly,We arrived a bit early and instead of managing that well we were forced to taxi for 45 minutes. Updates were both sparse and dishonest. Saying we’d be in no later than 10 even as things dragged on far after. Overall a terrible experience and totally mis handled by the captain and crew. Won’t be flying again anytime soon.
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Insane phone wait times,"Website wouldn't let me change my flight, so told me to call. I've been on hold for over an hour and a half."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Delta stole my money and charged me $900 for a ticket I already bought,"Vacationed to St. Thomas. Lovely time. On day of departure, delta informed me my ticket was void and that it would be $900 dollars to fly home. No warning. No call. No email. Ticket counter workers laughed at us. I knew there were pirates in the Caribbean, but I didn't think it would be delta."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Worst customer service,Worst customer service ever. First and last time flying this sad excuse for an airline. Wouldn’t  hold our flight for ten minutes but delayed our flight 3 hours. Wouldn’t rebook us another flight and laughed about it.
Date of travel: May 2021,50,Best airline,Starting off with instant message facebook they promptly helped me with issue I had and airport the staff is super friendly.  Onboard the airplane has nice large screen to view movies play games etc.  Basic economy you can bring one carry on and personal item which is so nice.  Best airline ..
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Never again!,They are so unprofessional they do not no how to talk to their customers.. just hearing them disrespect people is sickening.. and they are so not together..only flew Delta cause my ticket was bought. NEVER AGAIN !! Staying with Southwest (THE BEST AIRLINES)
Date of travel: May 2021,40,"Not very confortable, but gets the job done","The overall experience was correct. Not much space in the economy class for tall people but not worse than most companies these days. The seat was not comfortable (no neck support) so better bring your own pillow if you intend to sleep. The entertainment system was quite old. But in the end, we arrived at our destination on time."
Date of travel: June 2021,10,Gate changed without announcement,Delta changed the gate without any announcement of the change. I and three others who were their early missed the flight. At time of departure the board at the original gate still showed it was supposed to happen there. The plane ended up returning to the gate for a maintenance issue with multiple people getting off. Still was not allowed on the plane.Attendant was unhelpful and blatantly rude insisting that announcements were made even though all the people at the gate insisted none was heard.
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Significant flight change with no compensation,"A month ago, I choose this Delta flight because it was non-stop both ways even though there were cheaper flights available with connections.  Now I get a schedule change notice adding a stop on each leg of my trip, basically doubling the travel time, requiring me to catch a 6am departure flight, and make a 30 min. connection.  Basically flights I would have never booked in the first place.  I called Delta to see if there were any other options, but of course not.  Further, they offered no compensation in the form of credits or flight vouchers for such a substantial schedule change.  I think its wrong to sell one product (a non-stop flight taking 3 hours each way) and then swap it out with an inferior product (6 hours each way with a connection) without any compensation. I wouldn't trust/fly Delta again."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,never fly delta again,Tried to rebook flight to Salt Lake and they wouldnt change flight or use my credit toward another flight in future.  I didnt want a refund.  Horrible service.  Never fly delta.  Just looking to rip people off.
Date of travel: May 2021,10,DO NOT FLY,Do not ever fly with delta. This was the worst experience of my life. The planes battery was not working. We had to switch to Jet blue. We check our returning flight - they had delayed it by a whole entire day. So unprofessional and clearly horrible planes.
Date of travel: May 2021,50,Awesome 💪🏿,"Best ride ever! Greeted everyone upon entering the plain. Ride was Super smooth and comfortable, they provided everyone with drinks and snacks. Thank you Delta..."
Date of travel: May 2021,20,We Don't recommend Flying Together,"Me and my girlfriend booked a trip in March. Completely together on the website. As your time gets within 24 hours of being able to board the plane you can check in mobily. When we went to go do so, they had set us imi totally different seats, in total different rows. ON BOTH TRIPS. there and back. Thankfully for the kindness of other we were able to switch seats and sit together."
Date of travel: May 2021,30,Rude attendant,I just boarded a flight in Atlanta and the woman at the front was extremely rude to my whole family. We were at gate E15 and boarded at about 7:30 and she had been rude since we asked about seating at 6:45. She initially snapped at my step mom then again at my brother and I for asking questions about flying and luggage. I did not catch her name sadly but she was scanning tickets. I understand everyone is doing and needs to do their jobs and I’m sure its been a long say but still.
Date of travel: May 2021,20,🥺,"My experience this time was honestly terrible. One only flew with Delta And never considered another airline until this last flight. I was asked to move ( in not the best way) to help a family sit together. Mind you, I only fly comfort so I’m looking to be comfortable 🙄. I was asked to move twice. Once to the seat in front of me and then to the seat across the isle 😒. The lady I sat next to was ( large) she took up both order seats... it was the most uncomfortable seating EVER... I saw the flight attendant go to the ladies who I gave my seat to and apologize and seemed sympathetic...she didn’t say a word to me. Again I’ve never considered another flight but this was Definitely an eye opener. Both flight attendants were rude and I have never experienced that with delta."
Date of travel: May 2021,50,Thank you Delta,"After flying United to Montana several times, we were happy to give Delta a shot.  United has been terrible.  We couldn’t be more happy with everything on our flight.   Seating was roomy in comparison, staff was amazingly friendly (even with the annoying mask enforcement they have to do).  Amenities were updated and great to pass time.  Please Delta, up your service to Bozeman non-stop so we can finally do away with the other airlines.  My son with a knee brace who is 6’7 wasn’t miserable the whole time either!"
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Really bad airline,Flight attendants were extremely rude and condescending to everyone on the flight.  Worst experience.
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Delta Airline bait and switch!,My wife and I Purchased and paid for a “Comfort One” (AKA First Class seat).  The seats were offered at a good price and there were 2 available to purchase. We selected seat assignments and we were ready to go.  Received by receipt and all was good. A week later I was bumped to a lower class seat. We were place in 2 different locations with no way to change them.  The was clearly BAIT and SWITCH!!  Selling us one thing but deliver a lower class item.  Buyer beware when purchasing a Delta flight!!
Date of travel: May 2021,10,No customer service,I have called customer service twice and they say your wait time will be less than 2 hours. Once 2 hours hits they hang up. How do you email me saying my flights have been changed and don’t tell me how they been changed then to top it off they don’t answer the f phone. F you Delta. Made me waist 4 hours of my last day on vacation. Hope you guys don’t make it through this scam they call COVID
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Customer Service,8 plus hours on hold to reach Customer Service thru their phone lines or online messaging thru their website.  I will NEVER purchase from Delta Airlines again. Unbelievable disrespect for their customer's time.
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Worst changes and not response from Delat Don’t fly Delta in 2021 or 2022,"After being offered a paid upgrade, we said yes. Tried to pay on line , delta too the money and didn’t give the upgrade. Worse they the moved my wife’s seat , just because. The best we could do was move close to each other ! Talk about making things worse.Called for service there is NONE , zero zilch , call back take 2 days Worst worst worst service and I’ve been flying to 30 years !"
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Delta does not have their act together,"Don’t book with delta right now.  First we were told the plane was hit by lightning and then they said they didn’t have a crew.  I waited for 11 hours and just went home.  No offer of a hotel, food or even basic customer service.  Not sure if they ever got off.  Really bad experience!!!  I’d wait a while before booking delta."
Date of travel: May 2021,50,Grateful for their flexibility and SUPER fast baggage claim!,"Booked online through Travelocity - super easy.   We flew into Columbus from Boston - on time, great staff, and fast baggage claim.Staff were masked and courteous, and the plane was very clean.The trip home?  Ok - so we had to change our plans to a day earlier.  NO change fees, only paid the price difference on the tickets.  AWESOME.  Online was super easy.  Staff were so friendly, from baggage drop to air staff.  And again, the SUPER fast baggage claim allowed us to catch an earlier bus home!"
Date of travel: May 2021,20,A Once Great Airline in Rapid Descent,"I have been a Delta SkyMiles member since 1988 and a Platinum Medallion member for at least eight years. The airline earned my loyalty with its comfortable and reliable in-flight product and exceptional customer service. I have frequently paid more and tolerated awkward routings to fly on Delta because I felt they offered a superior product.Sadly, everything that drew me to Delta seems to be collapsing. I have completed five roundtrips with the airline in 2021, and significant failures affected all but one of them. This review would be far too long if I were to document each issue. The list includes frequent (sometimes weekly) schedule changes to upcoming itineraries, massive delays, cancellations, and misconnects (two of which resulted in unplanned overnight stays), and long hold times, even on the Platinum customer service line.Just this morning, I discovered that two segments of a trip to Maui later this year no longer exist. Delta's website tells me not to worry, they have rebooked me on other flights, but they have not. As that itinerary now stands, I will get to Salt Lake City with no connection to Maui. I tried calling the Platinum Elite customer service line. There's a 40-minute wait to speak with someone.In contrast to these experiences, I've been on Southwest Airlines four times since January. All flights have been flawless, with no unexpected schedule changes or delays. I have two more flights with them over the next couple of weeks. In both instances, Delta flights would have been substantially more expensive. I prefer the upscale experience Delta offers, but for now, Southwest seems to be much better at getting me from point A to point B in a hassle-free and reasonably comfortable manner.That brings me to my final point. I have a hunch that most travelers like me are looking for an airline that provides dependable transportation, an upscale in-flight experience, and exceptional customer service for the rare instances when something goes awry. Delta's CEO, Ed Bastian, and the company's Board of Directors seem to have lost their way. The decline in Delta's travel product has been accompanied by a noticeable upswing in Mr. Bastian's public statements about politics and an effort to evangelize customers on progressive causes. Rome is burning, and the corporate leadership seems to think they are running a policy institute or advocacy coalition rather than an airline. They appear more intent on preaching to their customers about politics and social issues than providing a fantastic travel product for all patrons.As both a Delta customer and a Delta shareholder, I'm deeply disappointed in my airline. I have resisted switching to Southwest because I prefer Delta's product, but I sense the time has come to make a move."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,"Delta is like a Driverless Car, wrecking all over the place","NOBODY is “home,” or steering the ship. Delta has NO representatives anywhere at this time, online or on the phone, and hasn’t for at least the last 2 weeks. Wait times to reach someone on the phone were literally 9 and 7 hours, when I tried to get through almost two weeks ago. (I really don’t think anyone is there on the line, anymore.) Agent at the counter when I departed could not get through either, much more than an hour before my flight took off. Last night I tried to check in for my flight back home, and was informed my ticket had been cancelled. Not my flight, mind you — my return ticket has been voided. Knocking off from waiting for Delta to respond at 2 am."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Horrible phone service,I need to change my flight do to an emergency and I stayed on the phone waiting for someone to pick up.  Well 3.5 hours later I got disconnected. Called back toast and I waited 2 hours for someone to pick up again no one answered the phone. Now in heading to the airport to see what they can do. I would never recommend Delta.
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Delta Sucks,"Every year I or my wife and daughter would fly with Delta to Beijing and back to Detroit.  Every year before Covid the rates would range from 1200 -2000 for a round trip.  These were in the busy times of June through August.  This year when Covid is coming to an end, the prices have skyrocketed.  You say it is because of Covid.  Wrong, you can find the 1200 - 2000 range with other airlines.  It is only Delta that is charging over $ 5000 for their round trip rates.  We have $ 1260 credit coming to us for the 2019 flights that were cancelled.  Delta is ripping their customers off that have a credit coming to them.  What a disgrace."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Worst Customer Service and They’re OK With That,"Our flight was booked in March to fly in May and Delta changed our flight times twice without notifying us at all. I am fortunately in the habit of checking my itinerary online often so that’s how I knew. They made no apologies and changed our flight again. We had to fly to Mexico City and connect on AeroMexico to Huatulco. Delta, in their vast knowledge of international flights and customs protocols, gave us 40 minutes to go through immigration, get our luggage, go through customs, turn in our luggage, and get to our gate for our connection.  Along with 1000 other people who just flew in from the U.S. Anyone, who is from outside of Mexico, who has been to Benito Juarez Airport knows that this is more fantasy than GoT or LOTR.  I, too, tried to call Delta and was met with 4 - 8 hr hold times. Shameful. When I spoke with the cocky, almost giddy Delta agent at the counter, she disagreed that 40 minutes is not enough time, in fact, after tapping on her keyboard (think ‘Meet The Parents’), she assured me that it only takes 15 minutes and our schedule was perfectly fine. I then asked her, “Then why am I standing here in front of you after having missed my flight?  Have you been down there at Immigration and seen the masses?”  She then said we were rescheduled on an 8:25 am flight the morning on AeroMexico and is there anything else she can help me with?!  All I could do was laugh.  We proceeded directly to the AeroMexico counter and were met by Gabriela, who confirmed our am flight but informed us it was 8:45 not 8:25, but set us up with a hotel, transportation, and dinner and snack coupons.  Something the Delta robot should have done for us but chose not to. This incident, along with the previous 2 months of playing “What time IS my flight REALLY?” has caused me to make the decision to never, ever buy a Delta ticket again. Had the mask mandate not become a federal law, I would have ripped that rag off of my face on our last flight home and had them watch my lips as I told them how I felt so that they could ban me forever. But Delta is not worth going to jail for.  Don’t torture yourself, fly another airline. Even your buddy with 200 hours in a Cessna would be a better choice."
Date of travel: May 2021,40,Francisco made me feel like a valued customer,"We had a difficult time checking in.  the agents at the JFK ticket counters were a little short and a little too serious  we didn't feel welcomed at all.  Then something very special happened during the flight.  Attendant Francisco, came over and called me by name to thank me for being a loyal customer.  I felt so special.  He made travel suggestions for our stay in San Juan, and gave us really great travel tips.  By simply representing the Delta brand, he completely changed our overall experience."
Date of travel: May 2021,50,"Delta San Juan, PR was amazing!","The level of service I received from the Customer Service and Ticket Agents was **beautiful** Karla was so personable she went above and beyond to assist and accommodate my group.  She was the last experience of our trip as we departed the beautiful island of Puerto Rico.  Karla, definitely represented the Delta Airline brand"
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Consider strongly whether to use Delta and plans change or are changed for you,"Flight hasn't occurred yet.  One stop flight in Atlanta.  Original flights had us arriving around 10:30 PM.  Schedule change for flight to Atl got pushed so they rescheduled our Atl to Jax flight to arrive at 12:45 AM instead. So I decided to splurge and upgraded seats to comfort for that portion.  Then then change the first leg to an even earlier flight. So I tried to get back to the earlier arrival in Jax.  I can't change online because of the upgrade.  So now, I try to call them. First time, they said wait time approx 4 hours (at 4 PM local) and they offered to call back.  I said ok.  Instead of 8 PM, the phone rings at 1:30 AM.  Nice, and then there was nobody there and I hung up after three minutes.  Next time I tried to call, after being on hold for over 4 hours, I finally hung up.  Never got a chance to put in for a callback.  Only messaging doesn't respond either.  Really Pi** Poor customer service."
Date of travel: May 2021,40,Great Flight!,"Did a round trip with Delta for a quick reunion.  The service was great, the flight home was great, thanks to the person admitting person was very kind and the two flight attendants on Flight 3715 were awesome!!! They deserve a raise!"
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Automated impersonal computer generated customer service,"Made reservations in March, need to change information on passenger for June Flight.  Impossible to talk to a representative ""they are assigning some one???!!). Nothings ever happens, no response and no way to solve an interactive problem with their ""chat referrals"" etc.  Have tried Twitter, Delta Web Sit, phone (they have the nerve to say it will be a 2 hour wait).  Why bother.  A large company that can't solve a simple problem unbelievable.  Southwest is always available and has clear instructions and resources.  I'm going to the airport and confront their representatives before my trip on June 21.  The Internet is full of no response reviews!"
Date of travel: May 2021,20,Terrible customer service,Tried to cancel a trip for my son because he couldn’t go because he had an injury and doctor prohibits travel.  Called 48hrs after I made the reservation and tried to cancel (trip is 6 weeks away)    Was like talking to a computer.   Spoke to a supervisor Named Nafi.  She actually seemed to enjoy telling me no.     $1200 down the drain.  Won’t be booking anything through delta again
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Junk from start to finish,"For starters,  you can never get through.  5 plus hours on hold.  Then I was supposed to get a call back in 5 hours which should have been 2:30p.m. I got not one,  but 2 calls at 2:30 A.M.!!!! Then I spoke to someone that told me military ticket holders can cancel their flight and they'll have money for a future trip.  The last guy I spoke to said that's NOT the case and you need ""orders"" to change anything.  Well your orders don't have to change for them to say you can't take leave time!!! BULL!!! Then my daughter was treated like complete and utter garbage during the flight.  NEVER EVER AGAIN WILL I FLY DELTA!!!!° IWILL PAY 200$ EXTRA FOR A TICKET WITH A DECENT AIRLINE!!!!!!!"
Date of travel: May 2021,50,So helpful I almost cried,"Cheapflightfares screwed up my flight (ticketed an 8:56 am flight for 9:59 am) and I missed it. After missing one flight and not getting on the next flight standby, with all flights to Boston fully booked all day long, and all the next day a wonderful Delta agent helped get my son and I on a 4:30 flight. I was ready to cancel the trip - 5 stars for Delta and their service!"
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Eticket will not work,I HAVEN’T TRAVELED BECAUSE MY ETICKET WONT WORK AND NOBODY WILL ANSWER MY CALL. Beyond pissed that someone can pay 700 dollars for a plane ticket and get absolutely zero customer service. I might never book with them again. Never had this issue with this extreme of wait times. This is ridiculous.
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Trapped in Mississippi,"I went to Oxford,Mississippi for 3 days. I was not planning on a fourth, but delta airlines had other plans. First my flight was delayed by 3 hours. This was going to make me miss my connecting flight and left me with no way to get back home(South Carolina)! Delta could not get me back to South Carolina until the next day. I had to beg the person who drove me to the airport to come get me which they absolutely did not want to do and I had to pay for an hour Uber back to their apartment. Now imagine if the person also said I couldn’t stay with them? I’d also have to pay for a hotel. I am in college and do not have this kind of money. People are paying upwards of  $500 as it is for these tickets, non-refundable might I add. For that amount of money this should not happen. Since Delta can’t control when planes decide to not work, they should at least give everyone enough money to get an Uber and a hotel for the day. I was lucky I had money for an Uber, but other people may not be. This airline SUCKS!"
Date of travel: May 2021,10,They hung up on me after I waited 7hrs,I called Delta to talk about changes they made to my flight to Alaska. When I finally got a hold a rep after waiting 7 hrs to do so the lady hung up on me after 30 seconds when I told her I didn't want to cancel my flight I wanted them to fix the problem!
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Delta's service has gone down the crapper,My husband and I booked a flight to Alaska back in February and I got an email for Delta airlines today saying that they have changed our flight to Alaska again (this is the second time). The first time it was annoying but not to bad since it only changed the flight times. This time however is worse. They have now changed our departure airport from BWI (which is 15 mins from here) to Ronald Reagan (which is over an hour from here)!!! And I can't even get a hold of customer service because the wait time is over 6 hrs just to talk to a rep. I sent them an email about it hoping it might be faster only to get an email back saying it will be 14-21 days before anyone responds!!! Delta Airlines service has gone way down the crapper over the last couple of years and I will be sure to never fly with them again.
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Terrible customer service and Beyond,"The flight from Atlanta was delayed by an hour and 10 minutes, because delta team decided to wait on a family of 8 to board, which made me (and others) miss our connection flight, so I had to stay at that terrible hotel in the airport overnight, only from 6 to 8 clock so I had to sit at the airport for 5 hours waiting to get my room and left at 8 am and waited at the airport for 9 hours for my next flight. While delta representative were so rude, 2 upset customers in the line were yelled at by delta representative for asking questions, and on top of all this bs, they called the cops on an angry old man."
n/a,10,Customer care is non existent ,Customer car is horrid! They changed my flight schedule dumping my family for 27 hours at an airport. Have called in several times unable to reach anyone. Now I have been on hold for over 4 hours still no one. No one answers the message app. This is total crap very very upset
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Terrible customer care,"I'm so disappointed in the terrible customer care on my recent delta flight. First, on the Delta email confirmation after purchasing the ticket, it clearly stated that we got a carry on AND checked bag (50lbs/23kil) Free. When trying to check in, the gate attendant first said we got NO checked bag for the ticket & after talking about it a while, they said, Oh actually you DO get a checked bag, but it has totally different dimensions than a normal checked bag, and it can only be 10lbs... All of this info, even though our email confirmation did not only NOT say that, but said that we should get a 50lb bag for FREE. On a call after the fact while filing a complaint about the issues with the flight and trying to explain my experience as a customer, the representative spent the whole time contracting me and his/herself. And even though they didn't know all the info, they told me I should have know because somehow it was clear... to everyone...? Bad customer experience on ALL levels. Great job, Delta. Tell us one thing in your direct communication about the flight and then hide the info that contracts that info, and then tell the customer they are the problem...?! Really?"
Date of travel: May 2021,50,recent travel with a 3 year old who could not wear a mask,"We had a flight booked through Southwest airlines for a family vacation/wedding. Our 3 year old son can not wear a mask for medical reasons. We contacted Southwest airlines 3 times prior to travel and were told to come to the airport with the medical excuse with a completed exemption form and everything would be fine. We waited on hold for hours each time we called (after hearing the news report Southwest horror stories of removing families from flights in the same predicament) and were disconnected even twice requiring us to wait several additional hours on hold before speaking to representative. The week before we were leaving, my parents had to make a flight change to their ticket as they were traveling before the rest of the family. The reconfirmed everything we were told in the past  but this time were told that what we were told on 3 separate occasions was incorrect. We were now informed that the information had to go to a specific department 10 days prior to our flight and we were now only 7 days out. After lengthy hold times again, we were very rudely told that it would of been approved but because we didn't meet the deadline, the exemption wouldn't be considered. We were in a panic. We ended up re-booking on Delta. We were able to communicate with them via text message on the delta app versus waiting on hold for hours after accessing their policy. We confirmed that nothing had to be completed ahead of time except obtaining the medical excuse which we already had in hand. When we got to the airport a gentleman by the name of Matt Brown was SO NICE and extremely helpful. He ensured all of the data was in computer, the doctor was called per policy and we were very quickly cleared. He ensured us that  there would be no problem down or back. The flight attendants were kind and non judgmental. Everyone went out of their way for us. I will NEVER fly Southwest again nor will anyone in my family. Delta hands down is 100% more organized with great customer service!"
Date of travel: May 2021,50,Great,"Great airline with great service. Not a discount airline, so expect to pay a little more, for which you will get a lot more in return."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Go to Alaska Airlines Instead,"Delta was absolutely horrible. Spent 2 and 1/2 hours on the phone to get not a single person and then when my husband tried to send a message to them it would redirect him to the start of the page. Basically what happened was we missed our first flight because we had to buy a new ticket so my husband could attend classes for his job, but we still needed our returning flight. I tried to call and got NO ONE! We called twice and both times we were on the phone for more than 2 hours! I’m never using them again, plus on the way to Denver on our other flight from Portland to Denver, our plane took like 20-40min extra before we could actually board. Delta is horrible and I have been flying ever since I was a child all over the states and this is the worst experience I’ve had. I’ve had better experience with spirit airlines than with Delta"
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Lacks professionalism,"Delta,  You have gone beyond the realm of lacking good customer service and gone to bare bones SUCK. NO  professionalism,  courtesy or humility.  Your service agents are a reflection of your company and let me tell you that reflection looks pretty despicable. My flight plan was for take off at 9:50AM. My bag was held up in TSA so my husband went to the gate at 9:30AM to board the flight.  The gate agent WOULD NOT print a boarding pass without a confirmation number even though he had his ID. The agent told him we need to be at gate ready to board by 9:45 latest before the doors close. I got there with my bag at 9:40. The doors were closed,  the gate agent was gone and there was NO last call.  When the agent came out,  said our seats were given up,  we ""missed"" boarding and he does not need to do last call.  He wouldn't even help with finding another flight instead pointed in the direction of the service desk. The agent mocked me when I asked his first name,  asking if I wanted his last name too. I voiced dismay at his lack of professionalism given his misinformation and lack of empathy in this scenario. Delta you lied about boarding time,  closed the doors in advance and gave away our seats,  did NOT even do a last call as courtesy DESPITE knowing 2 passengers were already on the terminal and lacked empathy and professionalism. We had to escalate this and speak to the supervisor who tried to defend the gate agent but ultimately knew this was all inappropriate and unacceptable. We will NEVER give you our business again delta.  I rather fly spirit which we did end up doing... and paying over $500. @delta #getyourdepartmenttogether #poorcustomerservice #disappointed"
Date of travel: April 2021,50,very goodc,"It was a good flight even wearing a mask & social distancing .  I only fly Delta. They are very helpful with problems or questions you might have, I felt very safe flying with Delta."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Done with Delta,"Just a PSA to not use Delta Air Lines. I couldn't use unless I called on the phone with the agent that the and they booked my reservation for the return flight on the wrong day. I tried to modify my booking since it is ALL OVER their website and hold messages about how you can make flight changes easily and without fees by using the app or the website, and they will even give you 1000 miles for doing so, EXCEPT none of those features actually work.I couldn't modify my reservation online or in their app and despite telling you to use the chat with an agent feature in their app, no such feature exists. Contact us gives you the option to call or Tweet them. No chat. The first time I called at 9:02 am, it was an estimated 90 minutes to 2 hours for a call back so I chose the call me back feature rather than spend 2 hours of my precious vacation on hold. As you can see from the call log, they didn't call me back until 1:48 pm, more than 4 hours later and OF COURSE when I clicked 1 to tell them I was on the line I was never connected to an agent and it hung up. Then I called THEM and was not even given the option to wait for a call back and instead had to sit on hold. I was on hold for LITERALLY 7 hours before someone answered (estimated wait time when I called was 3). I went to the beach, went to get beer, had lunch and dinner with friends with delta hold music on my phone the whole time. 7 f'ing hours! Then when I asked for an upgrade or some miles for recompense for spending my entire day dying on hold for them, I was simply told ""Oh no, everyone is waiting on hold this long. We have so many phone calls."" The whole F'ING reason I have to be on the phone in the first place is they're requiring me to because NONE of their features for modifying my reservation would work on any of their platforms. I'm done with Delta. And you should look elsewhere for airline tickets. They do not care and they will not get another penny from me once my vouchers and miles are used."
Date of travel: May 2021,50,First Class Operation!,"Professional, high standards, and friendly service. Delta has weathered the COVID storm and has maintained the high level of safety and service that we have come to expect over the years. If you want the best, fly Delta!"
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Never again!,We have been on hold for 4 hours trying to get rescheduled after missing our flight.  The “chat” has been open for 6 hours.  What kind d of company keeps people on hold for 4 hours?   This company has been destroyed by the pandemic. Don’t book a flight with them and don’t buy the stock
Date of travel: May 2021,20,Customer Service wait times 5 hours,"Booked a flight using Expedia.  I paid extra to be able to select seats in the Main Cabin.  I selected exit row seats and received a confirmation email as well as an email from Delta indicating that we indeed had exit row seats.  The morning of our flight, there was a plane change and we were reassigned seats further back in the plane and not in an exit row even though exit row seats were still available after I got the seat change.  When I tried calling Delta customer service, on was on hold for 5 hours.  I finally hung up when I got to the gate and explained to the agent what had happened.  She said that there is nothing she could do since the plane is totally booked now.  She gave me another number to call while in the airport, which I did.  They too said that they could not do anything and blamed the error on Expedia.  What?? I had my original confirmation showing we were in an exit row.  So I paid extra for nothing.  On top of this, the entertainment system was not working on the flight.  They rebooted the system and about half the passengers could access the screen, but not me.  Finally, I was charged for luggage when I shouldn't have since we have the Amex Delta card.  They said I need to call after the flight to request the refund.  ON HOLD now for 2 hours.  Good luck trying to reach customer service.  There isn't anyone at Delta."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,"the WORST customer service,,W_O_R_S_T!!","Charged us for some things they shouldn't have.  Which,, hey, it happens, I get that.  BUT, can't get ahold of ANYone to rectify it.  Hold times are SUPPOSED to be, they claim, over two hours.  Stayed on hold for over four hours yesterday then they disconnected me.  Their ""chat"" is the same.   I'd rather pay a little more than have ZERO customer service.  Bye-bye Delta."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,They canceled my flight without notice,"Received confirmation via text that my flight had been processed. Day of the flight, the kiosk can’t find my ticket, then the rep at the counter couldn’t find it. Finally after standing there for 20 mins in silence, he hangs up the phone and tells me I don’t have a ticket which is why the kiosk can’t print my ticket.Better yet, there were no flights available day of, and the ticket price is double now going from $300 to $600 a piece for my girlfriend and I.Thanks Delta #awardwinningcustomerservice"
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Bad,They kept telling us that it’s gonna be 15 mins delayed and kept stalling ended up being 1 hour delayed very unorganized would not recommend
Date of travel: May 2021,10,"Good airline, but poor customer service makes it not worth the hassle","I need to make a change to a reservation that is not possible through the website and I'm having to wait on hold for SIX HOURS. The airline is ok if you do everything perfectly and nothing changes but there is ZERO customer service available from this multi-billion dollar company that can't even provide basic customer service. They do not care about the customer, only every single dime they can squeeze and scam out of you."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Never fly delta. Horrid boarding process,"Never ever ever again. I will never fly delta again. I have never experienced an airline that doesn’t allow you to select your seats before boarding. Or literally assigns at the gate. The flight was no cheaper than any other airline. Had I know their seating policy before booking I would have gone with a different airline. If you get basic economy expect to be given your seat assignment literally as they are boarding the plane. So the stress of getting to the airport, going through the cattle call of security isn’t enough. Arrive two hours early and you won’t know your seat till they surprise you as you are boarding. Oh and when you ask someone about the seating they dismiss you and tell you that you will find out at boarding."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,rude service,"i was in the security line about to hand my I.D to the lady, this delta worker walked up and asked if i was with the man in front of me, i said no and she said i’m getting in front of you, while i asked why she said she had a disabled person. she could have kindly asked me to get in front but no she was rude and told me that’s what she was doing. will never fly delta again"
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Website complaint - charged me for 8 tickets,I tried for several hours to book a flight - kept putting all the info in and the website would just turn and time out. Subsequently I went and booked a ticket on another airline. 3 days later I got charged for 8 tickets! If that's not bad enough - I have been sitting on hold for Delta for 2 hours now and no call pick up in sight! I am going to have to dispute all 8 ticket charges - what a nightmare! Terrible website and terrible experience trying to call in!
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Worst airline ever,I absolutely hate Delta !!!! I will never fly with them again!!! The wait time to speak to someone in customer service is ridiculous!!! You cant make any changes or anything !!! Never again
Date of travel: May 2021,10,DO NOT FLY DELTA,"I made the mistake of booking a flight on Delta and due to the fact that it is a multi-city trip I overlooked the fact that the flight had a 23 hour delay the return leg of my flight.  Why would I notice that, why would I expect an airline to offer a fight that doesn't get you to your home airport until 24 hours later?  I contacted Expedia who I booked the flight through to change that single leg to a flight with a shorter layover.  I was informed that if I cancel the flight Delta keeps my money and will not issue a refund, I was also informed that I cannot make any changes to any economy priced ticket.  So no ability to cancel, and no ability to make any changes, not even for a fee.  So no we do not arrive home until the following day we booked our flight.  I'm not sure what planet any of this makes sense but I will never ever fly on Delta again."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Lack of customer support,"I purchased tickets from delta, it was a short notice trip so I had to pay higher rates. There were quite a few issues with the whole process, when the travelers got to the gate they were told the flight was full. I was trying to call support for clarification, the first day I sat on hold for 4 hours before I was kicked off, I was told the wait time was 7 hours. I tried to use the chat service as well as phone and have been on hold with no assistance since 8 am, it is now 2 pm.  I understand everyone is stretched thin in this crazy time, but this seems extensive to get answers about serious concerns."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,RIDICULOUS PHONE CUSTOMER SERVICE WAIT TIMES,"I've just called Delta Customer Service and was told by automated message that the wait time was ""over nine hours."" Absurd. Delta, please actually serve your customers. We will fly a different airline on our next flight."
Date of travel: May 2021,50,Best Flight attendant EVER,"I was seated in the last row of seats on my flight from myrtle beach to Atlanta, not thinking anything of it, and then our flight attendant Richard Davis came and sat with us. He was talkative, personable, professional, and most of all friendly and relatable and made our rather turbulent flight time zip on by with his conversation and humor. I have never had such a good experience flying Delta until today. Please someone give this gentleman a raise or promotion, his interpersonal skills are out of this world. Thank you for making my flight extraordinary Richard, you are fantastic!! 10 out of 5 stars. I’ll fly Delta from now on so long as there’s a Richard on every flight."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,"Delta rebooks your flights without notice, so that you will miss your flights.  Impossible to get help.","Terrible service to a loyal Delta SkyMiles member and my family.  Delta re-booked my flights without checking with me first for our family vacation.They rebooked the flights, knowing that we would miss our connections, with no apparent recourse.Then made it nearly impossible to correct this.  You cannot change flights on the website, or confirm any changes.  You have to wait NINE (9) HOURS to get someone on Reservations.   Terrible service for SkyMile members and families.  Delta has no loyalty or integrity to its customers."
Date of travel: May 2021,50,Mother's Day,"I cannot say How proud I am to acknowledge & thank Delta for their Great Customer Service! You all made my 1st flight to Phoenix absolutely wonderful.

Date of travel: May 2021,10,Horrible Customer Service,"I have been trying to contact customer service about a changed flight schedule. I called yesterday morning around 8:00 am and the automated system said it would be a 4 hour wait, so I selected the call back option. I did not get a call back until 10:45 pm!!! and I just so happened to barely miss answering it. The airline has now changed my flight time two times and I can't edit the flight online because we had to use our e-vouchers from last summer, so I HAVE to talk to a person to do this for me. Not only are we already paying for first class, but we had to pay an additional few hundred dollars per person to get the flights that worked best for us and now they keep changing them!!! This is ridiculous and horrible customer service. Please have someone, preferably a manager, contact me."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Slow as Christmas,Took for ever to get out of Sarasota. Seemed like the crew of flight 1503 could give a rats ass about anyone. Then when arrived at Atlanta it took forever to deplane which resulted in a bunch of people including myself to miss our connection. I guess Delta is to WOKE.
Date of travel: May 2021,10,trash airline,"Truly there is no costumer service. NONE. I waiting on hold for 4 hours and 19 minutes just to add my dog to my ticket (why can't you do this when booking??? Literally every other airline allows you to) to have them hang up on me 12 seconds into them ""picking up my call.""My guess is they don't employ enough costumer service representatives so they are so bombarded with calls they hang up to get through them faster. If the call disconnected, why wouldn't they have the ability to call back? Truly every modern phone fowarding service allows you to see the number calling. Delta is repulsive... they were the only airline social distancing through the majority of the pandemic so they cut down employment to try to make as much $$$ as possible. Canceling my flight and going to JetBlue."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Horrible Airline!!!,"Ended up missing my layover flight in Detroit yesterday due to Delia's own incompetence.  My initial morning flight from Pittsburgh was delayed over an hour because apparently the plane was in the hangar for maintenance, and about half of the passengers, including myself, attempted to change our flights because we were worried we would miss our layovers in Michigan.  The agent at the gate told us that the planes in Detroit would wait for us (which wasn't true), so there was no need to re-schedule anything.  By the time we finally arrived in Michigan, it was about 10 minutes past my scheduled layover time.  As soon as I got off the Pittsburgh plane, I ran to the gate where my layover to Phoenix was scheduled to leave, only to find that it had already taken off.  At this point, I was livid after being lied to in Pittsburgh and was told by unhelpful Delta employees in Detroit that I would have to use their crappy customer service help line to schedule another flight to Phoenix.  After being on hold for awhile, I just hung up and went to one of the gate agents, who nonchalantally and unapologetically re-scheduled me for a later flight to Minneapolis, which then connected to Phoenix. After speaking with several other passengers (who, by the way, all missed their layovers in Detroit as well and had to deal with the same thing), I learned that this sort of thing happens all the time with Delta.  I'm not impressed with this airline at all and will avoid booking with them in the future after what I experienced.  There are definitely better, more efficient airlines out there."
Date of travel: May 2021,40,Positive thoughts about Delta Airlines,"Although I did not want to go to Boston via New York, I had no other choice. I was very impressed with Delta for all areas of the travel. The staff in Bermuda were excellent."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Worst airline I’ve ever dealt with,"The customer service truly must be the worst of any airline in existence. They changed my flights times pretty much every week and I just put up with it. This morning they changed the flight from one lay over to 2 layovers. And literally all 3 flights home now leave between 8-9am. Delta, please explain how I’m supposed to be on 3 planes at one time. I’ve been calling all day with wait times of8 hours and just stayed on hold. Literally no one ever answered the phone. I waited long past the estimated wait times, and nothing. I have no idea how I’m going to get home. Avoid delta at all costs."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,HELLO?! IS THERE ANYONE THERE? HELLO?!!!!!!,"48 hours later...no human being to be had. Here's the complaint I sent to Delta. It says it all! I CANNOT believe a legitimate company is allowed to operate this way. Can it really be legal to NOT offer customer service? What do you do when there really is NO WAY to talk to a human being? Mastermind evil scheme for sure. Wait till you read this! (This is my complaint I email to Delta, i.e. the cyber inbox where messages go where no human being will ever care.In am absolutely infuriated! 48 hours and not a single human being has attempted to communicate with me. I feel like I'm living in the twilight zone and in my 51 years on the planet, I have NEVER experienced something so blatantly irresponsible and unethical. 4500 characters to tell you about this total crap show?! Let me try. Delta changed my original flight over a month a go. Moved my return flight up nearly 2 hours which meant I would miss the midday wedding that I was flying out for. I was able to go online and change my flight to a later flight. So, ticked off, but it worked out. Now, my son's graduation got moved up to Sunday morning and the flight I changed to will not accommodate this new graduation time. So, I go online yesterday to change the flight. The error message says I need to call 1-800-221-1212. I see in that this is probably due to the ""1 time change"" free of charge, but knowing that I made the original change only because that flight had been changed significantly (Did I mention that it also changed from a nonstop to a 1 stop with a 2 hour layover in SLC? So miss the wedding and instead spend that time in SLC airport?) Okay. I can talk to a service representative and straighten this out. I call. Wait time is 2 hours and 40 minutes. I'm traveling to my daughter's college graduation. Okay. I'll leave my phone on hold as I travel. Now I'm visiting...phone on hold. Now I'm eating dinner at a restaurant...phone still on hold. Now we're walking back to the hotel 9:30 at night...phone still on hold 233 minutes...4 hours 20+ minutes on hold and no one answered, not even a computer voice to tell me where I was in the queue. Talk about stress! Should I keep holding? Is this just a ruse? Will some one actually answer? Finally, I hung up. I called back this morning. 8:30 AM. Call back option. Yay! 2 hours and I'll get a call back. Help my daughter pack up stuff, go to lunch, to to the graduation ceremony (God I hope it doesn't ring during the ceremony!). Take her to dinner drive back home to MN...all the while waiting for this 2 hours later phone call. 11:08 PM the phone rings for my call back. It's been a long tiring weekend and phone rings at 11:08 as I'm getting ready for bed. I think ""Finally!"" I can resolve this issue. But no. Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do (Twilight Zone theme) I hear ""All representatives are on the line with other callers."" WHAT!!!???!!! I hold for 10 minutes or more...can't believe it. Nothing to say how long I will hold. Will it be 4 hours and 20 minutes again without anyone answering? What about the 15 hours I waited today to get the call back that put me straight away on hold? Now it's close to 11:30 I'm exhausted from the driving 4 1/2 hours to the graduation, the packing, the moving my daughter the driving back the 4 1/2 hours. I've got to get to sleep because I work tomorrow. But they just put me on hold with no indication that a human being will EVER talk to me. So guess what? It is now 11:45, I work tomorrow morning, I have an unresolved issue that I have no idea if there will be a different flight for me to take or not given the 48 hours I just wasted trying to get a human being to talk to me. And now I'm going to be able to sleep? HELLO!!!! IS THERE ANYONE OUT THERE?"
Date of travel: May 2021,10,no customer service,Our flight was canceled and we were automatically rebooked to an earlier flight that we could not make because we both work. The email said call to reschedule to a different flight or go online. Called and was given option to leave a call back number as wait was 1+ hours so I did. Meanwhile I went online and website said our flight could not be changed online you had to call.  8 hours later I have not received a call back and now when you call the wait is almost 6 hours with no option to leave call back number. To cancel and rebook the flight to an existing flight within 30 minutes of our original would increase the price $500+. Can you say scam. The message when you call says if you aren't traveling soon please wait and call later ...you mean so I can stress over 6 hour hold times and not being called back only 3 days before my flight?! no thanks.
Date of travel: May 2021,10,NEVER AGAIN!!!!,"Now that it's over and I'm back, I can talk about the way that we were treated by Delta in hopes that you will never have to experience what we did.. brace yourself,  it's long. Delta Air Lines Worst experience of my life.. Checked in 24 hours in advance, even purchased our checked luggage. Got to the airport 2 hours early.  Was told we still have to wait in line. Waited in line 40 minutes and then was told something was wrong with our boarding pass and we had to go wait in an even longer ""special services"" line where there were only 2 people even working. We waited patiently for over an hour. They allowed the guy in front of us to take all the time in the world emptying his suitcase so that it would be light enough to go on. Then when we finally got to check our bag, they said "" we can't check your bag,  it has to be checked an hour before the flight takes off. The lady next to him was all rude and said ""can you believe they are just checking in now "" Then proceeded to tell me we are going to have to fly out tomorrow instead as the plane will be leaving soon. I asked her to please speak to her manager and help us work this out as we did everything we were supposed to. She just rudely said "" nope, you can fly out tomorrow free of charge and that's it. I AM the manager, and I said that's all we can do. Russ admittedly said a few choice words and then said let's just take it to the gate and have them check the luggage there just like they do strollers etc. The manager just looked at me and rolled her eyes. I asked her if we could do that and she said ""I'm not supposed to tell you that you can."" So we ran to TSA security,  then they were rude to us thinking we were trying to carry on a bigger size bag. Then the security guy took my sunscreen I had just bought,  Aloe Vera, and my expensive lotion I need to have. Telling me sorry, you can't carry these on, they are too big! Uh yeah, that is why I paid $30 24 hours in advance WHEN I checked in to be able to check this bag!!!!  We run to the gate, 2 very nice ladies Dana and Sara were absolutely amazing. I had a full blown panic attack and they were very kind. The printer was broken so they couldn't print us a tag for our bag as we now had to check it since there was absolutely no room on the plane, and it made us hold up the entire plane for over 15 minutes. Everyone glared at us when we got on as if we were just ""running late""! Then, there were absolutely no pens available to fill out our immigration form and they told us to "" borrow a neighbors pen"" (Seriously? You guys are so damn worried about us appropriately wearing our masks but tell us to use someone else's pen?!!)My husband almost had a heart attack as he had a brain surgery a year ago and stress makes him sweat absolutely profusely and have heart palpitations. So I worried about him the whole flight. I was told to watch out for Delta as they are the worst airline.  I did absolutely everything I could in preparation and ignored the warnings. I see what they mean now. The way we were treated by that ""supervisor "" was awful and totally inexcusable.  If we would have listened to her and not gone until the next day,  we would have had to forfeit our trip, pay our full hotel room for 5 days and car to hotel in full as there is no cancelation. Their process absolutely needs to be fixed. If I check in in advance AND pay for my bag, I should be able to just take it to the front and go. I am devastated,  anxiety ridden and almost couldn't fly because of my full blown panic attack. Warning to all those out there!"
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Bait and Switch,"Booked a trip last year only to be told that my trip was canceled and I’d receive a “credit” for a future travel. Tried to book a new reservation in 2021 only to be told the trip had quintupled!!!!! Geee thanks Delta, I always wanted to donate all my money to you!!! Never fly Delta!!! Bait and switch  post Covid!!! What a bunch of smoking mirrors!!! Now I know why they gave a travel credit instead of a refund!! Shysters!!!!!"

No more","Guys this airlines is crazy airlines,  i was waiting in the airport for 24 hours i cut my ticket nonstop flight. No more delta. This is so weird waiting 24 hours in the airport. That is their problem.  When i cut my ticket from lax it was at 7:45am at the morning  then they said it delayed to 9am then it delayed to 6pm then it delayed to 7:45pm. They have to solve it as much as possible.  For future customer. They may because of covid but its not they dont have good strategyat all."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Bad airline,They broke something in the plane now we have a 45 min delay on my trip to Puerto-Rico And to fix it they use clear tape
Date of travel: May 2021,50,another great pair of flights,clean and comfort plus seats were great; everyone masked for Covid; change in Atlanta was easy from C to A terminal with plenty of time; Delta is always a pleasure to fly with
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Terrible,ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE !! We were at our airline gate 15 minutes prior to the flight and the airline said that we could not get on our flight. The airline had already sold our seats and they told us they could not get on. This is ridiculous please do yourself a favor do not fly this airline
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Old planes.,The flight attendants were extremely rude.The plane was on time.The plane food was garbage.They were yelling at a parent about their 7 year old and refusing to keep the mask on.Now you must have the vaccine to work for them.Utter garbage.
Date of travel: April 2021,50,Delta through my eyes,The ride to our vacation destination was amazing to view with top notch pilot s and steward s all you have to worry about is which drink or snack you want very respectable courteous and clean and the pilots  even tilt the plane left and right to  see all the views I totally loved it thank you so much I felt totally comfortable and relaxed and safe in your hands
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Terrible and difficult experience,"If I could give less than one star I absolutely would. Delta has been nothing but difficult and rude to work with. I have tried to get in contact with them for literal days and no one has been able to pick up the phone and I was on hold so long I simply just had to go to bed and then they just hung up my call and attempts at messaging them. I needed to cancel my flight due to sickness and I used eCredits to purchase the flight in the first place and all I want is someone to tell me if I can get those credits back or not, but no one can give me 30 seconds to answer that question. Terrible customer service- blows my mind how a company this big is this terrible at answering the phone."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Terrible customer service/scam,"Recently just bought 2 tickets for a trip out of the country, spent over 1,000 dollars on them only to find out we couldn’t go. SPECIFICALLY SELECTED tickets that DIDNT say (non refundable) next to them incase something went wrong, so when it came time to get a refund I was then bounced around phone lines, where every single representative was rude, every single one told me it was the next guys job to fix it, nobody wanted to point me in the right direction. One lady even sent over a confirmation email where it FINALLY said in the FINE PRINT all the way at the bottom that my tickets were non refundable. I am not exaggerating when I say I was on hold so many times for hours on end that it took me a week only to find out delta robbed me of $1300 and when they found out I was looking for a refund they automatically credited my tickets back to me rather then give me back the money. The last person I talked to that was apparently a supervisor was more worried about arguing with me, insulting my intelligence, and me reporting him that he couldn’t even answer my questions that I was asking. This is the first and last time I do business with delta. Their customer care system is pathetic, their employees are ignorant and unprofessional, and the do business like criminals. I’m glad they got that wasted $1300 from me, seems like they needed it."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Non-existent customer service,"I am currently on hold with Delta in order to add an infant to my ticket, something they require me to do over the phone. I have been on the phone for 2 hours and 15 minutes, as well as waiting for 1 hour and 15 minutes for them to respond to their chat customer service. I literally don't know what to do to get my infant onto my flight. I will never fly Delta again."
Date of travel: September 2020,50,Great flight and awesome crew!,We always fly Delta and have had nothing but excellent customer service and the cleanliness of their aircraft and terminals areas.
Date of travel: May 2021,10,DO NOT USE!!!!!,"We recently booked a flight for my daughter to fly on delta airlines and there are so many hidden fees that it’s ridiculous! They used my credit card for Unauthorized fees then told me about it right after they handed me back my card. Then told me to step aside so they can deal with other customers. And I was told that I could request a refund for the misunderstanding. So I called and waited 4 hours just for someone to tell me that they can’t refund me. I guess they are that desperate to get people to use those airlines. That’s stealing!!! Seriously, if you need to fly, I recommend using Southwest Airlines, there’s no hidden fees and you don’t have to pay for 1 bag per person. They also have great family vacation deals. Delta airlines you are frauds and thieves and you be should be prosecuted. And you will!!!"
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Worst Customer Service I have ever seen,I showed up for a flight that was non existent even though I had a confirmation email and booked through their app. We are going to be late to Hawaii and having to retake Covid test get back into to the island. This will have me wasting over $1k. Customer service at the airport said there was nothing to do even though they think I should be reimbursed. They said they couldn’t even accommodate me to a hotel or ride in Seattle which is where I was stuck. They told me I would have to call corporate which I have been on hold with for an extreme amount of time today with no response at all.
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Not impressed with service or delays,"This is one of my first times flying with delta and I will likely not be doing so again. Gate agents can not help you change or cancel your flight and the wait times on calls are outrageous (I tried their number yesterday and the wait time was over five hours.)That said, my first flight was delayed nearly an hour and the plane was too small for everyone’s bags so we were told to check them at the gate. My brand new carry on bag that I never planned to go under came back scratched, dirty, and beat up. That was just the icing on the cake for me."
Date of travel: May 2021,20,Minneapolis connection problem,Purchased a direct flight. Delta changed to a Minneapolis layover. Had 15 min to get from G gate to B gate! NO help from delta at all! A ride perhaps? I’m 60 and this was just rude and thoughtless of airline
Date of travel: May 2021,20,Airplane smells of urine!,Overall it was an ok experience. Most of the delta workers were nice. Delta changed my return flight from returning at 1pm to a 7am departure which would be difficult traveling with 6 kids. I tried to update on the app and they would have charged me additional fees to make the change. Every time I tried to call their customer service line they were so busy it just hung up on me so I opted for a return text. Took them a day to get back to me and if I missed a text from them they would think Im idle and would just not return my text. This may be due to them being short handed from covid. The airplane was nice on the way home but it smelled like urine! It was really bad! DL flight 857 please clean out your bathroom uggh! I would not have taken the time to write this review if the urine smell wasn’t so bad! It was a 4ish hour ride and sitting in that smell was awful!
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Customer service is horrable.,"Original flight included bring our infant grandson back from Texas.  He's only 3 months old so he would be sitting on our lap.  Those plans changed and he wouldn't be flying.  I called the delta 800 number to change trip info at 9 am May 10, 2021 and opted for a call back since they said the wait time was about 5 hours.  15 hours later at Midnight on May 11, 2021, I finally received the call back only to be put on hold for another 20 minutes.  The representative was not rude but not understanding why I would be upset with his call at almost 1 am.  If this is how Delta provides customer service, it will be the last time I fly Delta."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,My carry on was taken but returned but i  cannot get it,My carry on was taken on accident and the person got in contact with me.So no problem right.WRONG!Delta will not send my bag back to me.The person got their bag back and turned my bag into the Airport.They will not send it to me!I cannot even drive my vehicle.What an absolute mess!never flying delta again!
Date of travel: May 2021,10,St thomas delta agents are the worlds most surly bunch. ,"Why seek a job in customer service when you hate customers? The Delta agents at the gates at the St Thomas airport are by far the least customer focused bunch I have ever experienced in 20 years of flying. Customers are a bother, they are administrators first and foremost and could not care less whether you fly Delta or not. With other airlines heading to St Thomas now there are choices and this Diamond Delta flier will no longer fly Delta for our trips to St John. Service matters."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Terrible in pricing and website,"Now I can not recognize Delta any more. This company lacks of professional quality. (1) The price is very unreasonable. Economy is sold around $4000 from $3803 to $5100. But the premier selection can be sold around $2800 or $10,000. It is crazy for the price difference. The worst is that we spend around $4000, but only one checked bag. The second checked bag will be charge an extra $100. It is too unreasonable. I was told that I can put unlimited weight to the carry on bag when I called the customer service +86 400 120 2364. So I asked her: can I put 100 kg to my carry on bag? She asked rhetorically: ""How can you put so much weight in an small carry on bag?"" I said: ""It is possible!"" Then she said: “Yes!” Delta sells so expense ticket, this is why I didn't buy the return flight from Delta but from the United Airlines, cheaper and better, two free checked bags."

Date of travel: May 2021,10,Multiple delays without explanation,"Our Delta  flight was scheduled to leave Denver at 2:07pm. There was a thunderstorm that moved through the area at about 11:30. We learned shortly after that our flight was delayed until 3:46. Allegedly, our plane was diverted to Pueblo because it was too low on fuel to hold until the weather passed. We were notified of further delays until 4:06, then 5:11, then 6:40. All without explanation. Finally, an operations person came to the last assigned gate (there were many gate changes involved in this fiasco) and explained that the plane was detained in Pueblo and that the crew was about to time out. So, a plane was being sent from Minneapolis which would arrive around 8:30, departing around 9:00. Shortly after that, we received an electronic notification that our flight would depart at 7:55. When quizzed about that, the ops guy said maybe they could still get the plane in from Pueblo.  Really?  We finally departed around 9:00 on the last scheduled Delta flight to arrive in Denver that day. My wife and I were frequent business travelers and have flown hundreds of thousands of miles on Delta. We have always recommended them without hesitation, but this experience really shook our faith in Delta. Follow up one week later:  The crew did a lot of joking on the flight about the colossal Delta screw op. We’ve not heard a thing from Delta since the flight, including the usual survey. The flight attendant joked that we should move the survey to the trash when we received it. Ha, we never even got it."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Zero Customer Service,"Cancelled my 10.30am direct flight from Edinburgh to New York. Only they called it an operational rescheduling. Via Amsterdam. At 6.00am! So not direct, not going west but east, clearing immigration and reboarding at Amsterdam with the stress of only 2 hours to do so and then - about 9 hours after I left home for the 20 minute flight to the airport - I would be flying over Uk soil again. Back where I started. They cancelled all daily flights from Edinburgh and should have sent me via Heathrow on either their own flights or Virgin's. Instead they sent me from a different country going backwards only to come all the way back again.They told me they only give Americans their money back as they are required to by law if they cancel flights - they have no legal obligation to refund 'aliens'. It is hard enough worrying if borders would be open between 2 countries due to the fluid Covid situation without adding a third into the mix. They would not pay for a flight from Edinburgh to Heathrow as they do not codeshare with BA - the only airline making these flights. It would cost them money - which they should balance off by the money they are saving cancelling the flight. So they sent me via their nearest partner airline in Amsterdam. Lucky me - it could have been Turkmenistan and they still would have done it. So I can only rebook with them. I had to pay return flights from Edinburgh to London myself and book myself on a more expensive Virgin flight as they code share with Delta so I could use my refund. TIP - if you are not not an American Citizen don't book with any American airline in these unsettled times for the avaition industry. Book via an UK or EU airline as not only would they have to refund your money, they would have to pay you 600 euros for the inconvenience of cancelling your long haul flight and providing a totally unsuitable alternative which did not even vaguely resemble the times and route you booked. Which would - of course - make them think twice and often deter them from doing it. Avoid Delta. First time I have used them and it was for the sheer convenience of a direct flight. It will be the the last."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,The worst of the worst,"Do not fly delta, the rude boarding attendant by the name Keith Smith, what a tyrant, took me of the flight because I asked him for his name, after he was abusive to the lady next to me!

Date of travel: May 2021,10,No Class,"I’ve been a Delta fan for years but have seen service decline recently. I’ve been platinum for multiple years because of my work. I’ve been a member of the club for at least 15 years. I’m big (6’4”) and tend to fly 1st class because I get DVTs. I booked my flight a month in advance in order to be with my daughter when she made me a grandpa. Not only were my flights delayed but Delta moved me out of 1st class without a word and only when I complained did they offer a $200 voucher. It’s not a refund for not delivering the goods and services they contracted for, mind you, but a voucher that can only be used when I spend more money with them! What a bunch of garbage. Congrats Delta, you made me a Jet Blue member going forward."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Flight crew,"I found the flight crew to be rude. We usually fly mint service on jet blue, which we are always greeted with a smile and a drink. On other delta flights from Boston to Cleveland the attendants were not rude. It’s just these flight attendants who work certain flights. They seemed to enjoy yelling at customers and letting you know they are in charge. God forbid you protest their rude behavior.Do yourself a favor and fly Jet Blue and avoid these flight attendants from Logan to Cleveland. Flight 5671."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,"Even though I have Gold status, I get terrible service.",Delta has gotten terrible during the pandemic.  2-3 hours wait time on the phone for help.  It is in dire shape right now and is absolutely terrible.
Date of travel: April 2021,50,Love the Service!,"Delta airlines really surprised me with service. I fly various local and international airlines all the time and this was my first time riding Delta. The staff were super friendly. They were cheerful and literally dancing in the aisle. Honestly I felt like it was effortless and they always came by to ask if we needed anything. I felt like they took care of every passenger no matter what class you say in. They catered to all the needs everyone needed before asking, so much that I barely saw the help light turn on during the flight. Mind you this was a 7am flight and felt so well taken care of. Plane was very clean and bathroom was cleaned during flight multiple times.  Thank you guys!"
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Missed connecting flight,"My wife and I rarely travel, so when you book a flight in an airlines website and they schedule a layover, we made the mistake of trusting that they had given us enough time to make it from one flight to the other. We asked the stewardess getting off the flight if we could make it and she said “maybe”. No offer to help. We ran across Salt Lake City airport from gate A to gate B (on my recently surgically repaired knee) and got to the gate before the departure time and they wouldn’t let us on the plane. They pretty much told us we were out of luck and offered us no apology whatsoever. Booked us for a flight four hours later. We looked into just renting a car and driving because it would have been faster at that point. When we went to the Delta customer service desk, they told us it was our fault for booking the flight and refused to discuss the refund. Absolute worst customer service I’ve ever experienced. Absolutely do not recommend.  In addition, the “free WiFi in flight doesn’t work. They want you to pay for actual access."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Horrible Service,After holding on the phone 3 hours and 45 minutes and deciding to drive to the actual airport for assistance is appalling. This was after I held the call for 1 hour and 35 mins and the call dropped. I could not believe there was no call back feature. All I wanted to do was switch my flight time.  DO BETTER DELTA!
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Very poor service at Logan from Delta,"I fly frequently for work, and for personal trips. On my most recent business trip I was very frustrated with Delta's customer service at the gate. Petralina Dublin of Delta, a red shirt, was extremely rude and unprofessional. I had a carry on bag I've brought on multiple flights carry on no issue. Delta is certainly not the cheapest airline. Without measuring or conversation she targeted my bag, told me it had to be checked. Being in row 19 on a plan of 35 rows I questioned the method and explained my experience bringing it onboard other airlines like Jetblue. Nope. Dismissed me with a wave of her hand and said ""this is Delta"". Evidently Delta means more money, less rights, poor service. Next time I'll fly Jetblue, as I normally do."
Date of travel: May 2021,30,Plane was packed and not comfortable,I wish the airlines were not packing the planes totally full still. I feel like we are traveling less comfortably than cattle.
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Worst trip ever,"Half my clothes were stolen, from st.croix’s air port. Do not recommend traveling here. Save money and go st. Thomas"
Date of travel: December 2020,40,"Comfy seats, lots of free movies, you can see exactly where you are on a tablet in front of you.",I love the seats and the entertainment tablets they have in front of you. There were so many movies. I even wanted to be more time on the plane!
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Worse customer service,I waited 2 hours just to speak to a representative/customer service of the airline. The worse customer service system ever! There no sense of urgency. Not going to recommend them to anyone else.
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Traveling with a child? Don't fly delta,"I booked with delta through hotwire. I had never used delta before but it was the only airline that didn't have a 6am return flight. I was traveling with my boyfriend and 3 yr old son. Here's my story.First, I booked the flight and car. All the funds were pending. When it actually charged my card, I noticed it was 1 plane ticket less. I thought maybe they changed something due to my son's age, cool. So I questioned whether he would be allowed a carryon or not. The website says its based on price. Seeing as to how I wasn't sure what happened with the ticket prices, I figured I'd call to find out. I spent 9 HOURS to ask this simple question. 5 hours on hold waiting for someone to answer before I gave up, and 4 hours trying to use the online chat. Finally, I got someone, gave them the ticket number (which I figured they would say something if they missed the charge), they said yes to the carry on.Then we get to the airport. We're carrying our bags, a carseat, a stroller and a child. We were rushed through everything as if we were an inconvenience (ok whatever). We get to the gate and wait. Then our flight was delayed due to a mechanical issue with the a/c. For 2+ hours. We missed our connecting flight in Atlanta. At this point I'm stressed, but think ""better safe than sorry, things happen"".Flight back: again, rushed through security. Get to the gate. Wait. Another delay. Mechanical issue with the a/c unit. What are the chances? Again, waiting hours to get on the plane and missing our connecting flight home. Here's the kicker, it was the last flight from Minneapolis to Milwaukee that day so we were not getting home. They searched for options and said we can MAYBE get you on tomorrow but all of tomorrow's flights are booked up so we'll put you on standby and hopefully you get something. They put us in a hotel in Minneapolis for the night. I had thrown away a bunch of stuff that I didn't think we needed anymore; toothbrushes, toothpaste, trial sizes of deodorant, all of the toiletries. So we had none of that. Ok now we go to the airport again to see if we can get on a plane. They luckily said yes, gave us tickets. We wait. They announce the flight was overbooked and offered $400 for someone to take a later flight. No one took it. Eventually they landed on $600 and someone gave in. $600? I got a $50 hotel room to wait an entire day. Moving on, we go to board and they gave each of us separate seats. I asked if there was a way my 3yr old could sit by either myself or my boyfriend and they said I could figure it out myself. Finally, an attendant on the plane helped me switch seats with another rider so my toddler didn't have to sit with a stranger.We got home and I was just relieved to have it all over with. Then I check my bank account 5 days later and delta charged me another $438.40!"
Date of travel: April 2021,40,Very Relaxing Flight!,"Delta airline has the nicest planes around. All seats have extra leg room and the larger planes include a TV on the back of each seat to keep you entertained with free movies, music, and tv shows. I would've given Delta a 5 star review, however my first flight was delayed by 2 hours which postponed my vacation. The luxury of the plane made up for it though! Make sure to ask your flight attendant for a margarita. They come in miniature soda cans, but are WAY stronger than any margarita you'll get at a bar. I think mine was just tequila and lime juice hahaha it made my flight so much shorter :)"
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Delta is awesome except the phone service,I have tried to contact someone already 4 days because i need to make changes and the app is not letting me. Yesterday i waited 5 hours on the phone. For real! 5 hours. And then the call cloaed magically. Never called me back. Please if somebody see this message. Call me back 561-502-3438. Is urgent.
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Delta Sucks,"I changed the email address on my account but the old address continued to receive emails from Delta--clearly a privacy concern. I called them to reconcile this and have been on hold for two hours. One of the most frustrating experiences of my life, I hope they go out of business."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Delta doesn’t care !!!  Don’t fly with them !!!,"Wish I listened to my friends when they said Delta will never be on time and make my  travels an extra Day !Short  flight to Atlanta turned into an 24 hour travelling day !  They slowly pushed the delay 2O min each time that I had no confidence I’d meet my connection.  Thankful the best attendant in Austin was kind and considerate to all the passengers needs .  She moved me to the front of the plane to get me off faster to try and make my connection  However, after rushing to the gate for my connection...10 min before flight time , I was told they closed the doors early and would not make exceptions.  They knew our flight was late ... there were at least 6 of us .   I was there ... the plane was there !! Why couldn’t I get on . Sure they gave me a hotel accommodation, but the team in Atlanta was rude and not concerned .gave me no food credit and wrong directions to get to the hotel .  Terrible service . Very disappointed !!  Read reviews people.  They don’t lie"
Date of travel: May 2021,50,Very Happy Delta Goes Above and Beyond During Covid,"I recently flew to visit family in Michigan. To Michigan I flew Alaska and I flew Delta back to Seattle. Delta was a significantly better experience. Alaska’s planes had visible dirt and were packing people in and it was clear they were only doing the bare minimum, and had questionable practices during covid. However with Delta it was evident that the actually wipe down surfaces, as there was no visible dirt and they are spacing people out with a seat between. As well as boarding the plane back to front. I will be going out of my way to book Delta from here on, the care and quality is greatly appreciated and made the flight much more enjoyable and less stressful during covid."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Will not fly delta again,"Purchased tickets 2 months before actual flight. Itnerary and flights confirmed, was at yhe airport 3 hrs before flight and was told by the agent that my flight to Philippines was cancelled by delta/expedia. Expedia/delta didn't inform me, now was stucked at the airport in my city and didnt even continue the trip. Worst exerience ever."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,Frequent flyer who recently tried Delta,"As a frequent flyer, nothing is more important than customer service. In this regard, Delta must be the worst of the major airlines. My experience was awful in every sense of the word. To start off, I purchased a first class ticket and was bumped into coach at the last minute. Then the 7-hour phone wait time to speak with customer service. Delta must have an army of people in marketing and social media, because they have the worst airline, but somehow great reviews? I for one can not wait for the reckoning Delta will experience. What comes around goes around Delta, watch and see."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,"Unable to check in, Missed my flight","Delta Representatives at the Quito airport printed my ticket but refused to board me saying that they need to call the US Embassy about my VISA, upon requesting a fee for name change but failed to find supporting policy documents. I waited at the counter for 2 hours and was told that I am not allowed to board while they are calling. I spent 10 hours in the airport booking another flight from midnight and suffer financial loss from their poor system and service. They told me they would refund me in three business day and I have not yet received any refund, and I am now making phone calls to Delta about the ticket status. The most abusive, discriminative and incompetent representatives ever. In contrast, I was checked-in with United within 15 minutes boarding my flight. DO NOT FLY DELTA."
Date of travel: April 2021,50,Very accommodating with change of schedule,"Twice my wife and I have tried to visit friends in Pennsylvania who were celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary.  The first time we made our reservation in late November 2020 for a January 2021 flight.  Well the Pennsylvania governor pretty well closed down travel so I had to see if Delta could help me.  As I (at that time) did not know when we could travel, Delta refunded the cost of the ticket and recredited me with my companion ticket.  Everything was restored.So we decide to try again, everybody had been vaccinated. We booked flights in March for a later April trip. On the Wednesday night before our departure on a Thursday, our friend was rushed to the hospital with heart pains.  I get on the phone the morning of our flight about 3 hours before we were to leave to see if I could get anything refunded.  Yes, the Delta Agent was so great, she would refund my money, reissue the companion ticket with an extended life, and also refund some Skymiles I used to upgrade the tickets.I know that the first change was made during Covid policy changes and the second change came at the end, but Delta could have not done and been any better.  I will always sing the praises of Delta Airlines."
Date of travel: May 2021,10,"Cancelled flight, no ecredits, impossible to speak with anyone at the airline","I booked at ticket to Chile for April 2021.  Chile is not allowing non residents from any country to enter.  I tried to cancel my flight online but was not allowed the option.  I waited on hold for over 4 hours.  The agent finally cancelled the flight and promised I would receive an email with the ecredit.  It never showed up.  I have been waiting 5.5 hours using the chat feature to find my credit.  As it stands right now, I am out over $2000 and unable to speak with anyone at the company.  This is so bad it seems criminal."
Date of travel: May 2021,50,Class act....the premier airline,"Best airline hands down. Amazing customer service and flight options. I will only fly delta from now on, the other airlines have really gone down hill."
Date of travel: April 2021,50,"Great flight, great service!","First trip to Texas! Great customer service at gate C2 in Minneapolis. Flight #662. Flight attendants were very friendly and efficient as well. One of the best trips I've ever taken. Arrived terminal in Dallas, took 5 minutes to get from gate to ground transportation. Covid practices in place on flight and at both airports."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,We were super loyal to this airline,"I don’t know what has happened to Delta! We have traveled with them all over the world and have always enjoyed fabulous, on-time service. I made a simple reservation a month ago for a round trip flight for July. Yesterday, I got an email that they had changed my flight departure time by 12 hours and return flight by 6 hours and that I would be cooling my heels at an airport for 7 hours waiting for a connecting flight. So, I tried to follow their instructions to get it sorted out and while on hold for a few hours (they don’t offer an option to call you back anymore, apparently) I tried to book another flight with the original itinerary. The original flights were still there and seats (mine?) were still available but for triple the cost I paid! My dear husband was on hold with messaging for 8 hours (I was working) and finally got through. I am getting a refund, not ecredit, thank goodness. I booked a more convenient trip on United for $100 less than my original Delta fare was. I don’t think we will be using Delta, KLM, Air France, Latam, etc. again unless they can come up with a reasonable explanation for this. Those poor customer service reps! Who did this to them? Whoever is in charge of the customer service department needs to be handed a pink slip."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Horrible booking situation,"I normally think Delta is the best US airline. I am a Gold Medallion member. Buy is it different now. I needed to make a minor change in a reservation, same flight, two days later. The site was overloaded, so it was almost impossible to log in. After finally logging in, I went through all the process of modfiying the reservation and paying the new fare, but the site was again overloaded and would not confirm the payment. So I tried calling Delta. The wait time was seven hours. Yes, seven hours. That means I can't use my phone for the whole day. Haven't succeeded yet."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Delta does not care about their customers,they do not care about customers when something goes wrong on their end. No help at all. You are left to figure things out for yourself.
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Don't Get Trapped by the Price,"Booked a flight last September but wasn't able to go with certain new restriction for Covid. Got a hold of Aeromexico asked them to change the flight to October. They called back telling me that I can only do mid September due to the fact that October is over the 1 year from the original book date. So I went ahead of changing the dates to mid September. Reminder that they called me back after I called them. Come March the original flight dates I'm getting emails about procedure to board my flight. Granted $400 isn't to much to lose out but when you're paying for 3 people that money adds up. So now after calling Aeromexico for 5 straight hours and getting hung up on while they look stuff up I loss a lot of money. Calling Delta was a 3 hour hold. Sorry but I work 6 days a week and like to live life not stay on hold for 3 hours where I can't go hiking, fishing, kayaking, or just enjoy my life"
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Ridiculous Itinerary changes,"I booked a 3 city trip with Delta - Phoenix to Atlanta to Daytona Beach, back to Atlanta, then Phoenix.  I booked these flights and within 2 weeks Delta changed my reservations to different flights or times, and resulted in a 4.5 hour layover in Atlanta!  Like that is even reasonable.  Now I have to wait 2 hours on hold to speak with a reservations specialist because THEY jacked ME around.  Not Cool Delta.  I will be looking elsewhere for my travel partners until you get your act together."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Worst experience ever!,"Checked in online, never got boarding pass. Called to get advice, on hold for 3 hours, at the same time also online on  ""chat"" feature hoping to get through on one or the other. NEVER EVER fly delta again. N E V E R !!!!"
Date of travel: April 2021,20,Lack of Consideration,"We had to change our destination due to Covid restrictions for a family vacation and while we thought everything was going smoothly, Delta had a different plan. about two months out Delta started changing everyone’s flights. Unfortunately, these were not changes that were insignificant. They had changed flights by 6-8 hours. The email said we could change flights if those no longer worked; however, they didn’t offer anything that left or returned close to the times we originally picked. Trying to rebook 11 people to a new flight so we don’t have to rebook the rest of our itinerary, where we are meeting additional people, was challenging at best. Then a week later they did the same thing to a family member so we had to completely change our itinerary again. We also had to wait 3 hours on hold to talk to a person. This is terrible service on Delta’s end."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Terrible CS,"I have now been on hold for 2.25 hrs, to discuss an upcoming flight for our company.  It must be handled on the phone and can only be handled by a supervisor.  The business I need to discuss is required by the FAA, and if it is not completed can cause serious disruptions to our travel, so I cannot just drop it.    When I called this morning it was estimated to be a six hour wait.  I had work to do so had to call back, that time it was estimated to be two hours, so I called United Airlines for another flight we had going.  WOW!  I was on hold for about one minute, updated what needed updated and was off phone about seven minutes later.  When I called the third time, it simply said they were experiencing high call volumes and to try online, then the call disconnected.  Why doesn't Delta have the call back feature where you can leave your number and they will call you back and you do not lose your spot in the queue?  I certainly will not fly Delta for my personal travel and will strongly recommend our company does not either.  I have flown Delta many times, never had a problem, was always happy, but I have better things to do with my time."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Horrible customer service!!,"I traveled they broke my london fog suitcase and refuse to pay for it because I didnt notify them in 24 hrs meanwhile I went to the office and it was closed, I took a pic of the number posted there. I was literally sick my entire vacation, after arriving home the next day I had made a drs appointment, I ended up gettin a heart monitor and I  forgot, called the next day a foreigner didn't understand gave me the wrong instructions on how to file a claim called back and received the right info. They emailed me and said theres nothing they can do! im sorry I was about to die and I couldnt respond in 24 hours! I am a nurse and this how i get treated! Tuh! I will never fly with them again!!!! fly with someone else!!!!!"
Date of travel: April 2021,20,Hours to reach a live person!  Please travel with someone else!,"I have had many flights with Delta over the years since I fly out of their main hub in Atlanta.  Their price has gone up in recent years with an inverse reaction with their customer service.  I recently purchased a flight through Kiwi.com to save some money since it was for 4 people, and the flight time changed without any notification (the fight is still 2 months away, so this was not a delay).  In addition, I have tried to reach their customer support and the hold time is HOURS.  By hours I don't mean 1-2, but more like 4-6.  Go to another airport and use another airline until they get this resolved.  I just booked a first class ticket with AA for a Chicago trip in September and the flight was not much more and no issues as all.  Done with this horrible customer service.  They charge a premium price for subpar service at best."
Date of travel: April 2021,40,A good short trip.,This short flight was very satisfactory.They were on time and flew safely.The short flights like this rarely offer anything except transportation.
Date of travel: April 2021,50,A nice trip all the way.,"On time, comfortable and good services Checking in, gate information and service staff en route were all top notch"
Date of travel: April 2021,50,Amazing service,We flew Delta from Seattle to Los Cabos in April of 2021. We were first class and our Flight Attendant was Michelle and she was AMAZING! She was so attentive and kind. Just wanted to give her a shout out! Hope to have her again! Thanks Michelle @ Delta!
Date of travel: April 2021,10,The worst customer service,Waiting time to respond to my call 5+ hours. The call back of 4 hours extend to 10 hours and after that they call you after midnight.
Date of travel: April 2021,10,terrible service,I'm trying to change my wife's return flight. I just called customer service. Wait time on phone? 3 hours and 40 minutes. Delta you suck
Date of travel: April 2021,10,WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE - Waiting 29 hours & counting in Delta call back queue,"I have been trying for A WEEK to speak to a @DeltaAirlines rep about a horrible ticket change they made to our upcoming trip which I can’t now modify online. Wait times on the phone have been up to 6 HOURS, even thought there are no weather emergencies this week or other reason for overload. I  finally found a way to get in a callback queue  via an automated chat box on their site. After 29 HOURS, I have STILL not gotten my call. Every couple hours throughout these 29 hours I’ve gotten a text asking if I still need a representative. Well, YES!!! I googled this problem and found out this has been going on FOR OVER A YEAR!!! They’re blaming COVID, but other airlines we’ve flown don’t have this problem. WHAT’S GOING ON AT #DELTA???!!! Who’s in charge of their customer service??!! So before you book with Delta, think twice — they will change your DIRECT  flight, specifically chosen for its departure as well as arrival times, into an awkward, terrible INDIRECT flight and then be totally UNAVAILABLE to help you sort out your options via a LIVE PERSON. Their online support is a joke."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Low Standard for Customer Service,"Delta Flight 3840: No Wifi - I know this happens on planes and this breaks down sometimes. Flight Service – Refused Drink 7:19 while crew members were not seated and had not closed the service center. Went and took trash after pilot announced the decent tens of minutes later. Flight attendants continued to talk for a series of time with no regard for members of the flight. Disregard for passenger requests, comments of flight attendant asking if passenger knew about extra charges for drinks after they have been ordered as if someone couldn't afford it... (partial to sitting in the back of the plane). Begging of the flight, requested red wine and they were out by the 18th row. Nice Stuartist, but Gentleman seemed to not have the same respect for others and seemed to care more about his conversations with other crew members than doing anything for the individuals flying. Lastly, they completely missed getting the tray tables up, pulling up reclining seats and checking in on folks before they went and got strapped in for the decent. Seems like their conversations really got the best of them this flight."
Date of travel: April 2021,50,Private jet,Flight 737 from atl to hobby this morning provided phenomenal service. I get like I was on a private jet. Their energy and professionalism was excellent.
Date of travel: April 2021,50,Excellent Customer Service!,My flight home got canceled due to an issue. They were able to assist me and reinstated my original flight and time. Amazing job researching what happened and going out of their way to help me.
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Terrible Customer Service experience,"I had to fly with an infant-in-arms and their process to give the infants information is the worst thing ever. The ONLY way to claim you infant is to call the main Delta number and the hold would always be 3-4 hours it claimed, no matter if it was 8AM, 1 PM or midnight. I was on hold for 6 HOURS one day and never talked to a single person. Yet, I have to make this call or I can't fly with my infant. How many people must fly with infants every day, yet they make it the most difficult process. Hire more customer service and allow and easier way to give your infants info. They only ask for their name and birthday, so it's not like it's some difficult thing to do. The picture I took is of half way through my hold with Deltas customer service."
Date of travel: April 2021,20,Just always average,"Delta is always just ""ok"".  Flight attendants are never overly friendly and always show that it's ""just a job"".  Also on this particular flight they lost my luggage.  Had a 3 hour layover and somehow they couldn't get my bag on my connection.  Received it a day later.  Paid $40 and couldn't get the $40 back, instead just received a credit for future travel...which may never occur."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,SHAME ON YOU DELTA AIRLINES! 31 hour wait time and absolutely horrid if any customer service,"Tried several times to call Delta today after a major change to my itinerary that Delta made, which does not work with my originally booked plans.  No one replies in chat and phone waits ranged from 3 to 31 hours.  That’s right, 31 hours.  This is unacceptable in any business to have no options for recourse or response to service customers.  Do not give them your money, unless you prefer to be jerked around and have Delta decide what they think is best for you, with no way of fixing issues. They don’t care about you, your plans, or anything else as long as they have your money, because they know you can’t reach a live body to do anything about it in time. The email I got about my changed itinerary suggested I should call customer service at 800-221-1212.  This number is like a black hole and as good as screaming your frustrations into outer space thinking there’s one Delta employee who will hear your cries and like magic, hear and fix the problem.  Delta Airlines - SHAME ON YOU!! You’ve lost a loyal customer."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,THE WORST if one needs to change a flight.,"I am currently on hold. It's been, lets see: 3 hours & 17 minutes so far. It's gone from a challenge to psychological warfare. And I thought Comcast was bad. As  much as I need to see my family (it's been a minute = a year and a half), like most of us.  I may have to wave a white flag as say, ""So long, Delta1"" Someone else waited 9 hours???"
Date of travel: May 2020,10,A bait and switch,"Just booked a specific flight for a specific time and price. Realizing I would be paying more for a flight that had a shorter layover and better departure times, I paid for the higher priced flight. But guess what? Delta modified my flight to have a 3 hour layover instead of the one hour and instead of leaving at 12:45PM, I am getting up at 0-dark-thirty to catch my early flight because Delta decided to carve a huge portion of time out of my vacation to suit their needs. My favorite part is the 7 HOUR WAIT for their customer service. What utter garbage this airline is. I'm cancelling my AMEX which I use to earn Delta miles and going somewhere else."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,"Delta to customer: ""NEVER CALL US.""","Delta Airlines customer service has deteriorated from irritating to horrible.  I was just told that my hold time will be ""less than 3 hours and 26 minutes.""  No offer of doing a callback.  Last week, they told me that my hold time would be 2 hours.  I actually waited for an agent, and none ever came on the line, even after the two hours.  This is the result of a management decision to understaff their customer service system.  The human agents do a fine job whenever you can actually get one on the line.  I was calling because Delta had changed a flight--for the third time--to an itinerary that did not work.  Their system would not let me modify the flight online and instead said I should call customer service at 800-221-1212.  These days, that is a line that leads to nowhere.  End of rant...for now."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,"Terrible, check in for 2 hours, miss my flight","DON'T BOOK WITH DELTA! I was at the airport two hours before my flight. First i need to change my name and was told a change fee but the agent had trouble finding the policy. Then after a long time searching they told me it is not required. Then they say the system does not take my visa information, and they had to make multiple phone call to check. I spent the two hours standing at the counter. 10 minutes before my departure time they were still calling, and i was told that i cannot take the flight. Then I was taken to the airport police station to take my luggage. They searched through my luggage and closed it forcefully with my belongings caught in the closing gap. I ended up staying at the airport and purchasing another ticket from another company for 300 dollar more and paid for overstaying extra day on my visitor visa, so I don't have to miss work on Monday. This is the worst experience i had checking in. I don't deserve this. And when the agent was looking up my name change and visa info i was told that if they dont find it it will be my fault to miss the flight... Very rude. Humiliating. Never again.I booked with United instead and headed to Miami, after waiting a whole night at the airport. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE"
Date of travel: April 2021,10,4+ Hours to get a hold of customer service- never booking Delta again,"I've now been waiting to talk to a Delta rep for 4 hours. This is absolutely terrible, will never book a flight from Delta again. Jeff Bezos, can you please school the Execs at Delta on Customer Service please- it's 2021 and they're pretty clueless."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Horrible Customer service,I have been on hold for over 9 hours to speak with a customer rep.  They changed my flight.  This is the second time I have been on hold for over 9 hours in the last 2 months.  I will not use Delta again.  Nor will my company or associates.  Maybe if it hits the bottom line they will improve.  ( I don't expect it too however).   I have learned my lesson to not use this airline.
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Downgraded seat to main cabin without reimbursement,"This airline has been going downhill for years. I have been a long-standing frequent flyer. Today they downgraded my seat to main cabin and did not offer any reimbursement or compensation. They have been running over customers for years by substantially overbooking flights. I am tired of being treated so badly. I know they don’t care about any individual customer but after years of loyalty, this GA resident will be flying anything BUT Delta from now on."
Date of travel: April 2021,50,Delta took care of us,"We recently vacationed in Colorado and flew the round trip on Delta. We supposed to return on Friday, but a late season snow storm closed I-70 near Eisenhower Tunnels. We called Delta customer and they easily adjusted on flight to the next day at no extra charge. Then on the flight back fro Denver there were severe thunderstorms in Atlanta. They pilot did a great job landing the plane, but because of the severe weather we were forced to wait for about an hour because of a ground stoppage. Delta came through again and gave us 5,000 frequent flyer miles due to the problem. Thanks Delta. You are our airline!"
Date of travel: April 2021,10,WORST AIRLINE! DO NOT FLY! RIDICULOUS!,I am so upset and frustrated with Delta Airlines. Due to weather the flight was cancelled (Sunday) and  when I politely asked how to book another flight the response was “we can get you there Friday or however far north which would be Newark”... are you kidding me? The staff was rude and I’m definitely never flying this airline again... I’ve been stuck in Atlanta for almost 24 hours because there’s no flights to my destination. Worst. Experience. Ever.
Date of travel: April 2021,10,mad customer,The trip too was great but on the way back was horrible I understand due to weather but they should have a back up.plan when they reschedule your flight some people have kids and have other events that they can't stay 2 or 3 nights in a motel I had to rest the best I could . horrible lack of communication. and they sent our luggage to the wrong  place..sad sad sad and sorry!!!!
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Delta sucks,Delta airlines has changed my direct flight out to a connecting flight. Then I get another update this week for my flight home which now moved up several hours. When I called to figure out what Is going on they explained that I will likely have more changes and they won’t compensate me for the flight only refund the ticket which at this point will be much more expensive to switch airlines because it’s so last minute. I have flown multiple times during Covid and this is the only airline I have had this problem. Delta sucks it’s that simple- foolish if you rely on this airline. I’ll be shorting this stock as it’s only a matter of time before they go out of business.
Date of travel: April 2021,10,"Subpar service, slow and terrible apple","This airlines continues its malfeasance in line that reflects it mediocre customer service in a app that never updates boarding passes, and worst off little or no updates about delayed departure time. The airlines lies about delay reasons, and instead waits to fill empty seats while others on the plane leave. I got a flight from Atlanta to New York and the airliner continued to waste my time with weak excuses, causing me to pay more for Uber’s upon by delayed arrival and cost me hours or of time."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,3 hours and 48 minutes on hold to book a flight!,Outrageous!  My husband had to fly today because his mom passed away and it took us almost 4 hours to book a flight!  He has been exhausted because of lack of sleep and the flight got delayed over 3 hours (no explanation) so he requested an upgrade in the airport and he was told that he had to request it 24 hours in advance...he didn't have 24 hours the flight was booked today....I am disgusted because the business class was almost empty ...not to mention first class....shame on you and your inexistent customer service. If not even in difficult situations you cannot help your customers then when.....

Date of travel: April 2021,50,Amazing,"Delta’s been booked up the last few times I needed to fly, so I was forced to fly Sun Country... Let me tell you, getting back on a Delta plane was a TREAT. That basic economy felt like first class compared to other airlines. I missed flying and not hating my life and being over charged for having a carry-on. 😅"
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Had to cancel for government imposed COVID-related travel restrictions-NO REFUND!,"Had to cancel for government imposed COVID-related travel restrictions-NO REFUND! This is racketeering.Purchased 3 tickets to Spain 4 days ago, and since then government imposed restrictions required cancelation due to COVID-19.Delta refused to provide a refund. 5.4 billion in aid they receive for the pandemic, and they can't even give me a refund rather than a credit I'll never be able to use."
Date of travel: April 2021,20,"""Re****"" is the word Stan used to describe my husband struggling to fit his carryon in.","We have two young kids so we were pre-boarding since it takes us a while.  Hubby went in with my six year old but was in a hurry to fit his carry on up to to come back and help me (I had baby, broken toe and needed to fold my stroller up and the base before coming in.  Anyhow, hubby didn't come back quickly so I managed and started to walk onto the plane w baby when Stan, an attendant was telling another attendant"" WHAT A RE****, HE'S BEEN TRYING TO GET IT IN AND IT WON'T FIT, TAKE SOME STUFF OUT MAN! HA HA HA HA"".  I look down the isle at what they are laughing at an it's my husband....  I turned to Stan and said, ""You calling my husband a re**** huh?, okay""... Stand responds with, ""Oh $#*!.""  Oh $#*! is right, Stan......Now, where do I start?  1. Using the word ""Re****"" as an insult alone... I can't.  I don't have the words right now, but grow up.  Educate yourself Stan, wtf?!2. My husband stands 6 ft tall, 220 lbs of muscle, brown belt in BJJ, of course you're standing behind the tenant wall laughing, I didn't see you saying anything to his face.  Mhm3.  The ONLY reason I didn't tell him what happened was for your sake.  You're welcome, you POS. 4.  I think in the future, if you see someone struggling it would be nice to go offer assistance.  We had been traveling for 10 hours already and you really could have helped.Lastly, I gave it 2 stars and not 1 because the person at the front desk helped us with our seating arrangement and was real nice.  Also, I like the entertainment on the flight and the pilot did a nice job flying the plane."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Fly tickets,"It's a very horrible company, they changed my tickets 3 times without telling me,shorting out my personal time during the traveling, I will never recommend , never fly again with this horrible airline , charge me extra for their mistakes."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Squeeze them in!,"Sitting on a packed flight, sharing an armrest with a stranger.  Hard to COVID distance when you are literally touching because the seats are so small.  I wouldn't be as mad, but there is an empty row of seats in the First class row.  They won't move anyone though because COVID distancing isn't as important as the illusion of class separation. Will not fly DELTA again until COVID is not a concern."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Delta does not honor veterans with baggage fee,"Most US-based airlines offer up to three checked baggage for veterans.  Thank you to all the airlines who support not just active duty members, but also those who served.  No thanks to Delta."
Date of travel: April 2021,50,COVID safe,Delta was still reserving the middle seat. The flight was great! Everyone complied with the mask mandate. Food was snacks only. I think that's the way to go from now on...
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Worst/rudest staff!!!! Never flying delta again!,"I was flying alone with my 2 year old toddler! The staff wore being super rude to me about my mask as for they didn’t tell me to put one on at the entrance and went off on me my whole flight and my next flight, timing me to eat and yelling in my face (no social distance at all)  checking up on me every 5 min, I had my mask on the whole time except when I would eat! Flight attendant called my next flight and the flight attendant there was also being so rude and started bullying me about my previous flight how I wasn’t wearing a mask (which I was the whole time) just tends to slip sometimes when constantly moving around after my toddler! Random People sitting around me said they’re never flying delta again just by seeing how the staff were treating me!!! WORST STAFF!!! Seriously don’t care about their customers at all! They were not picking on anyone else except for me (the single mom with a toddler) like its not hard enough already flying with a toddler!!! The 3 most rude ladies weren’t wearing name tags!! Otherwise I’d put them on blast"
Date of travel: March 2021,30,comfortable,"unpleasant and bad service , The cabin crew were  not on my expectation, thus  I am no using this airline in the  future for my trips , and not recommending others to use mentioned airline."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,the worst customer service evee,it take at least 2 hrs to speak with a representative if you have a problem with your flight. never use again.
Date of travel: April 2021,30,Delta needs to focus on equipment maintenance,"We flew to Melbourne FL one week ago. We were delayed due to weather, but then we’re diverted to an airport other than our destination for equipment repairs. In all we were delayed 6 hours. OK. I’ve flown a great deal. I realize this happens. Then today, when we are to return home, the plane cannot take off again due to maintenance issues. At present we are 4 hours delayed. We are going to miss our connecting flight in Atlanta. I’ve never flown Allegiant, even though their prices are a fraction of Delta’s. But I guess I will have to give them a try for my next domestic flight. Maybe the Delta CEO needs to worry more about the maintenance of his fleet, and less about voting laws in Georgia."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Ditch Delta,"One would think First Class is a standard above comfort or coach.  Not on Delta!!!  My son flew United, received hot meals, was able to lay down and rest.  Ture comfort of which you pay for.My daughter and I flew Delta, got a kids lunch box, constantly reminded to wash our hands and wear masks which is mindless brainwashing.  Side note, aircraft should be put in the graveyard.  Absolute crap!  Will not fly them ever again and add in their political ""none of their business"" support just frost the cake for me."
Date of travel: April 2021,50,Delta is the Best!,"The CEO of this company “gets it!” Hats off to Delta for making the best during these difficult times. We flew Delta twice during the last 10 months and they have been consistent in every way. Pilots and staff are always welcoming and keep you well informed at all times. I’ve also taken American twice and they are the total opposite, and a very dirty airline all the way around. Delta has set the standard and others should take notice. Job well done! Keep up the good work!!"
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Not allowed to board because of a Check mig issue,"I had a flight to Bogota on 4/15/2021. Since Colombia requires the Check mig form to be completed on their app, I completed it. This was not the first time using this app. Unfortunately on this day, my Check mig showed a departure date of 03/01/0001. Anyone in their right mind should know that this is not a valid date. The agent said to try the Check mig app again, I told them that it was a systems error and not my fault. Tried again, the app says they is already have a record. I  am livid, I don't live in New York. Got re-booked for the next day. Went on Check mig to put information for the next flight date, same error They better let me board this time. Such a headache and horrible customer service. I am a long time Delta customer but this might be my last time flying with them."
Date of travel: April 2021,20,Maintenance problems on a plane with Delta help desk telling us no flights out,"We were lied to from a representative at the Delta help desk at the airport who was rude to us and would not give us an opportunity to change a flight. They said it would be 3 days before we could leave Florida as all flights are booked outgoing to OKC from 3 airports. The phone rep also mislead us. It took me calling in again to get the flight finally changed after a missed day at work and nothing but a measly food voucher from Delta's help desk. They gave 1,000 points which amounts to $10 USD. They should've given compensation for the Uber ride from the airport to the hotel and paid for the hotel stay and given more points especially when the reps were caught giving false information. When they told us no flights were going from FLL to OKC we looked online and there were SEVERAL from multiple airlines including Delta."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,"Terrible. Old worn out airplanes, rude service","I'll never fly Delta. I don't like planes that are falling apart, rude staff and service that is down right disgraceful."
Date of travel: August 2020,50,Thank u for caring about ppl and not $,I fly often but out of all the airlines delta is the only one who blocked the middle seat thru this whole pandemic and im grateful! U guys showed it wasn't about $but safety and thats y im only flying with u guys going forward! Service was great...clean aircraft...jus love everything DELTA
Date of travel: April 2021,20,Just the Check in process is terrible,"So, I’ve found that Delta’s website is the least user friendly of all. It’s unfortunate I had to use different airlines on a round trip do to availability. You would think I could just easily purchase a a checked bag like every other airline..... not so. You can estimate bag cost, find out what you can pack in a checked bag..... but you’re not purchasing a one way checked bag. Tells mr call customer service , as of this moment I’m on hold for 2:44 yup coming up on three hours when the recording said one hour wait times should be expected. Guess they will get me for the $10 uncharged at the airport, probably what they wanted anyway."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,"Terrible experience, disgusting","What a terrible company Delta is when it comes to their customer care. My flight was delayed about 8 times that day before finally canceling the flight at 1145pm. I was traveling alone, and did not know what to do. There was barely anyone around that could help or at least guide me or anyone in the right direction on what the next steps were for us. I finally found someone, who was extremely rude and when I asked what I should do next/if they could provide me with a hotel room (considering its their right to help now that I was stranded) she said ""I don't need this I've been here all day"" and walked off. I was in hysterics until another lady decided to step in. Delta did provide me with a hotel, but not many others. They did not give me any food vouchers either. My bag was ""lost"" until 345am, so i didn't get to check into the hotel until after 4 am. They refuse to reimburse me for my ubers as well. The best delta wanted to do was give me a $50 visa gift card as an apology. Mind you Jetblue and other airlines that canceled reimbursed their customers with the money for the flight that was canceled. Then not only was I mess from all of this, I wasn't even promised a flight home the next day, I had to go on standby for two flights out. So I just had to pray I was going to get home. And if I didn't they would have booked me on a flight 2 days from that. Meaning I would have been in Miami all alone, would have had to call out of work for anohter 2 days and find child care..I will never fly delta again, let alone fly in general. And i will never recommend them.I will write reviews and call whoever I have to to make this right."
Date of travel: April 2021,50,"Flight 1262 Very smooth, great service","Unfortunately, during the COVID pandemic Delta has not been providing hot food service in first class, but will resume beverage service on April 14, 2021. Beginning June 1, seats will no longer be blocked for COVID spacing (the middle seats). So things are slowly returning back to normal. The flight attendants could not have been sweeter and more professional. The flight was boarded quickly and on time. The snack boxes provide a variety of choices and the Flight Attendants were on their game. We’ve stopped using the bargain Greyhound Bus airlines because you really aren’t saving a significant amount of money."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,If you have kids go with a different airline.,"If I could give zero stars I would sadly. I've been flying with my mom for years. I switched it up to use Delta by recommendation for my son's first time flying and we rode their airplanes 4 different times. First time, I paid full price for my son's ticket expecting him to for sure get a window seat. We ended up with the only non window seat and my son was having a melt down. I pleaded to pay more to take up a different set of seats that had a window and we're empty. The flight attendant ignored me, passed me multiple times through the flight watched my son cry, and me. Because I was so frustrated. And two of our flights didn't have the TV on the back of the seat working but everyone else's was. I will never go this route again. They care less about our littles. If you have kids go with someone who will value your dollar. I spent way too much to get treated the way we have."
Date of travel: April 2021,50,Excellent flight to Paris,"I always fly with Delta when I can and this overseas flight from Atlanta to Paris was great.  Super nice staff, good food and drinks, clean plane and on time flight arriving early in Paris.  No airline is perfect all the time but Delta is a very reliable transport.  When I got to Paris I found out my Czech Airlines flight to Prague had been recently cancelled due to not enough passengers!!!  Typical of the terrrible horrible Czech Airline whom I do not recommend anyone fly with.  I try to avoid them whenever I can.  Could not reach anyone with Czech Airline (as usual) and the Delta and Air France staff were so helpful and got me on another flight with KLM.  Thank you so much Delta and Air France."
Date of travel: April 2021,50,Excellent flight and service,Love Delta and fly with them every chance I get.  I am a frequent flyer and travel a lot overseas (Europe).  No airline is perfect all the time but I have fewer issues with Delta than other airlines.  On this trip to Atlanta they finally got back to offering drinks and snacks and the service was excellent.  Very nice people with an on time flight and clean plane.  The only issue concerns not being able to contact customer service on the phone this time.  There was a 5 hour wait on line (they said) and nobody called me back when I left my number.  At the airport there was no line and they were very helpful.
Date of travel: April 2021,10,They just lost a loyal customer,"I will never fly Delta again.  It was that frustrating.Wife and I booked round trip from JFK, NY to Las Vegas for April 5-11.  We booked flights months in advance.  We upgraded and selected Comfort Plus seats as my wife has intense fear of flying and we like the idea of extra room and close to the front.We flew to Las Vegas without issue.  As we began our get away, we were emailed by Delta to advise us that they moved me from Comfort Plus to the back of the plane.  So I couldn't sit with my wife?  I called, waited about 2 hours and finally reached someone.  He said, when they make a change like that, notes are normally entered to explain why.  However, none were entered.  I asked if a single traveler could be moved instead and he said, it was beyond the company's control.  What does that mean?  They normally break up couples travelling together?I argued a bit, lost and agreed for us both to move to the rear of the plane.  Ok, wasted about 3 hours in Vegas dealing with this.  I was aggravated, but life goes on.Our last full day in Las Vegas, at lunchtime, I get an email and text from Delta saying the flight was now completely cancelled.  It was due to them having crew scheduling issues.  (I wonder what happened to the guy who HAD to have my seat?)So, to reach someone, I waited over three hours  this time.  There goes last day in Vegas.  I was offered an Alaskan Airlines flight to Seattle with a 6 hour layover then a middle of the night flight to JFK.  Ummmmm, no.  I am a first responder and had to work that night, plus my prepaid parking would expire, plus we wouldn't get home till the next day.  Oh no worries sir, we are giving you a $50 ecredit.  Haaaaaaaaa, you frustrated me twice on same trip, wasted hours and cost me money.I cancelled the flight offer.  I booked with Jet Blue and flew back to Connecticut the next day.  Of course, once home I had to do a 4 hour round trip drive to get my car at JFK.Jet Blue was excellent.  It was my first time flying with them and I was impressed.For a family who exclusively flew Delta, this was no way to be treated.  Hours and hours to reach someone there?  Alternate flights all over the country to arrive home a day later?  $50 ecredit?  No explanation for a move booked well in advance?I highly doubt Delta cares about me and my one family, but we already booked our next flights to Florida, and guess who we went with....Jet Blue.  Buh bye Delta!  Do better."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Be amazed by Delta vacation package,"With Delta airlines, Get your family stuck at the same airport for 13hours  Explain your crew 5 times that we are rerouted. You just lost one day work or one day fun. You and your family really enjoyed the meals at airport for the great value based on the ratio quality/price. Enjoy the voucher treasure hunt that never ends  ..... and get the empathy bonus if you succeed in connecting with Delta customers online assistance within 7hours !If you still didn’t give up you should definitely apply for a delta skymiles membership  that you will never use again! The pic shows the first Aid kit provided by Delta for 12 hours wait."
Date of travel: April 2021,50,Best airline ever!!,"I am a frequent flyer and I usually fly another airline as I have a loyalty account with miles however, I went out on a limb and booked with Delta because of the high standards of cleaning and social distancing Delta has maintained throughout the pandemic. I was absolutely blown away by how incredibly nice, professional, knowledgeable, friendly and customer service oriented the entire staff was! From the ticketing agents to the gate agents and even the people directing us off the tarmac, to the folks responsible for our bags. I will definitely be flying Delta from here on out. Aside from a particular international flight partner, Delta is a cut above all other airlines in my opinion. All flights to and from were on time and early. Can't beat it! Thanks Delta!!"
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Traveler,"Absolutely the WORST experience I have ever had in travel. Flying out of FLL, flight was delayed 5 hours over a storm that ended in a few minutes, all while other airlines were still flying out. This caused us to miss our layover flight. After arrival at SLC, we were forced to sleep on the floor after no accommodations were provided. After this, our new flight was also delayed several hours and NOT ONE attendant had an answer or apology for the situation. Disgusting service, disgusting company. Never flying with delta again, and I would recommend everyone do the same."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,"Delayed flight, 6 hours waiting and no compensation",Our flight was delayed - no explanation given and had to fight to book an other flight.Had to wait 6 hours for the next one and no compensation was offered.Ruined the day and late for work.Careful with delayed Delta
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Ineffective crew and flight attendance,"Due to an obvious lack of coordination/communication/ maintenance management of DELTA staff , my initial itinerary is now canceled with no other choice than losing 7 hours of my time in Spokane. Boarding desk Delta crew rescheduled me and my family for a 24hrs trip!!!! Insane !!!! Fighting like crazy, finally got a new itinerary with + 7 hours only !!! Good job Delta Airline. To your motto you should add “keep climbing .... whenever we can”. And the most insane thing is: there’s absolutely no plane and 0 traffic in this tiny airport. With anticipation we could have reached Seattle airport by car even faster than with Delta float!"
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Randomly changing my flights and 4-6 hour phone wait times,"I placed my ticket order 2 months in advance and my tickets have been changed twice within a week. Their customer service is atrocious, very very long wait times. I couldn't get a refund so they got me this time, but fool me once..."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Delta Service and Staff are horrible,"The Delta staff do their best to not have to answer any questions at the gate from anyone.  I fly several times a month and Delta is the only airline that I have noticed that they don’t ever have staff at the gate that are willing to help or actually answer any questions.  Whenever a customer is disgruntled (I have seen about 20 of them now over 3 different trips) they say, “sorry, I can’t help you.  That is just a policy that we have.”  The airline as a whole is geared to not be helpful to anyone and just provide incredibly frustrating experiences for everyone.  Stay away from Delta."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Horrible experience,"Woke up at 430am to a text from Delta that our 11am flight was canceled and there were no other flight options out of a possible 3 airports for 3 days! I had to call them to tell them how I wanted to handle the cancelation. I waited on hold for 1 hour and 31 minutes before a representative answered the phone. Then I could barely understand him as he barely spoke English. He put me on hold for another 15 minutes without ever returning to the line to try to tell me what was going on. When he did return, all I was told was he submitted my request for a refund but I would have to wait 7 to 10 days before I found out if I was going to get my refund. But, in the meantime I had to rebook a family of 8 on a southwest flight and pay $1500 to get us home without knowing if delta would refund my money. Thank God Southwest rescued us!! When I landed at home, I had an email from delta saying my flight was canceled because of a crew issue! Really!! Mechanical was a better excuse!"
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Glad to escape Atlanta,"Flying Delta to Albany, GA out of Tulsa, OK. We waited on the phone to confirm our seats for over 3 hours. The app and website wouldn't allow us to complete the process. The lady that helped us was nice, and got us squared away at least when we finally got through to someone. We didn't know it at the time, but the previous plane to Atlanta broke down and so ours was extra packed. When we arrived in Atlanta, we sat on the tarmac for an hour and watched our connecting flight leave from our window. When we landed there were no gates open to dock. The dock we were supposed to go to was plugged with a plane that had broken down. The tug that was supposed to move it out of the way never showed up, so we drove the plane around to a different wing of the airport. The ramp operator didn't know how to operate the ramp when we arrived and had to get assistance, delaying us further. The flight attendant wouldn't look anyone in the eye on the way out when we could finally leave. Once off the plane, we were directed to go to a bank of black phones. I wanted to talk to a real person, and calmly stated that to the lady pointing me to the phone. She said my situation wasn't a big deal, and it wasn't to her, obviously. I had a distraught wife, screaming baby and bruises forming on my shoulders from lugging around all my luggage. After the phone, where they said there was nothing they could do for us to get to our destination, but promised us a $50 voucher we never received, we had to track down our checked bag. It took 4 hours for them to find it and bring it to us. We had to call for the bag 3 times. We had to get to our destination, so we couldn't wait for a flight the next day. Everything was closing. Luckily we had a screaming 2 month old. I feel like without that we would have gotten no help at all. As soon as things went south, we were hung out to dry and abandoned. I'm not saying anything new, but wanted to add my story to all the others out there. Delta, you are Satan's airline."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Very Bad Customer Service,"I called Delta Airlines to get some information on the procedure of traveling with this Covid 19 and to see where I could have a test done in time to meet there standards. The guy that they have on there automatic machine told me that the wait time to speak to a representative would be 2 hours and 5 minutes due to high call volume. I'm thinking wow that's along time, but I need the info so I'll wait. 2 hours and 30 minutes later nobody has picked up this phone I was beyond pissed. I eventually hung up at the 2 hour and 40 minute mark. Almost 3 hours of waiting and came away with no information, because Delta decided that they wasn't taking calls. I will never fly Delta again, it the customer service is this bad picture the flight."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Delta is trash,"Delta will never get my service again. The gate representatives wouldn’t let my partner on the flight because they saw him drinking a beer. They asked if he was “okay” and then wouldn’t let us board. They did not give any compensation for a Hotel to stay in overnight, so we had to pay for one at our own expense. Delta is trash. For the love of god fly with any other airline."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Bait and Switch,"My husband and I booked a return flight home from Cancun on Delta, non-stop at a reasonable time, willingly paying a higher price for the convenience. This week, Delta randomly cancelled the flight and rebooked us on another flight, not even seated together. The new flight is NOT non-stop and changed our travel time from 3 hours to almost 8 HOURS...we will now not get home until 2 AM if we are lucky!  Forty-five minutes on the phone with a Delta ""customer service"" agent who obviously could have cared less about the inconvenience or that we would not have chosen this flight had we known. Delta is not offering anything for the inconvenience; however, he did graciously give us extra legroom seats that we had already paid for but they had taken away on the new booking without refunding the money. COVID has been hard on everyone, but airlines should not be allowed to get away with defrauding and cheating customers!"
Date of travel: April 2021,50,"thank you so much Delta, you are the best!","Always an excellent experience, politeness, and comfort. Thank you for keeping middle seats empty during these difficult times."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Poor customer service,Wait time to connect customer care is endless. I am connected since 2 hour 50 min and yet no one is ready to talk. There has to be a limit for something. Very bad customer service
Date of travel: April 2021,50,Safe comfortable travel during Covid,"Only second flight since Covid and both were exemplary. Wasn’t sure what to expect. Read all the extensive measures taken for safety. Decided being on a delta plane was probably the safest, cleanest, most virus free place to be in the world. I was concerned the disinfectant smell would be overpowering but needn’t have worried. It was just pure clean air. Seating was thoughtful for safety blocking middle seats and in first class ( we were upgraded) the seat next to you if not traveling with a companion. Very well distanced and boarding back to front was very well thought out. Purell wipes were handed to each passenger upon boarding and social distancing was maintained well. A little bag of water and snack was handed to each person. No carts or beverage service. I missed this on our earlier flight but the lovely flight attendants came by on this trip and offered wine. This was such a welcome surprise!  I also took note that every time a person used the restroom a flight attendant went in and cleaned and disinfected the restroom. Very well done delta. I have gone crazy not flying but now I have no fears at all and as soon as the UK and EU open their doors to Americans we will be up in the air again. Thank you Delta for being the best."
Date of travel: April 2021,30,Still Can Use Improvement,"I read on-line that Delta had re-designed seats.  Didn’t help.  Still no lumbar support!  Painful over several hours.  To go from DCA to:SAT, must change planes in ATL.   Must try another airline!"
Date of travel: May 2020,50,AMAZE BALLS,I Love this airline they have the best vibes going on like literally could not have asked for a better flight they gave me peanuts and sprite like wth amazing service the people on the planes also had good energy and yeah 10 out of 10 would recommend.
Date of travel: April 2021,20,Left us on runway for 35 minutes,Delta a big disappointment when they left us sitting in the plane on the runway for 35 minutes.  Gates were open but we were not allowed to go to them.  Pilot and crew were trying hard but delta and detroit DTW would not cooperate and give us a gate.
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Almost kicked off over mask,"Id say about 10 minutes after takeoff my mask was bothering me, so I took it off for literally 5 seconds, so I could switch to a disposable more comfortable one in my bag, of course the second I did that the flight attendant threatened to land the plane and kick me off. Wasn’t too friendly or understanding, also lacked compassion after I told her I have breathing problems, but its okay there are plenty of other airlines that I would rather throw my money at in the future."
Date of travel: January 2021,30,It looks like they are trying harder then others,"I had a quite few flights during this plandemic. Not many people were flying and I had a luxury on many flights to be a single person in the entire row. I had a few times opportunity to chose my seat for not so much extra money and I think it was worth.I did not like their boarding procedure. But, it does not matter when you sit in - first or last, unless you have enough legroom. I like them because I can use my T-mobile in-flight free wi-fi, which other companies do not have. I don't watch TV, series and stuff on their screens or APP. I would appreciate if they have more live concerts. But, that is almost non-existent. However, it's our local ATL company and I think they provide decent service compared to the others. As about recent corporate involvement into the politic, it will be rewarded, soon. I don't need to comment on that. I know, personally, several of their crew members and they are all great people."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,"awful service, lack of care amd concern",I am upset with the lack of care and quality on our flight down to Georgia ATL then Augusta. On March 31st Wednesday. We left Detroit DTW airport around 7pm in route to ATL. No announcements or anything that we couldnt land on time or that we are heading into bad weather condiotons.We circle the ATL airport 3 times because of high winds. Unable to land then We get redirected to Birmingham Alabama airport. To refuel and take off again which is what we was told. We land in Birmingham we are on the plane for over an hour to refuel and what not. Then the pilot says we are unable to leave because they have timed out and they have no other team members to take over the flight. So we get off the plane and told we will get a shuttle to ATL. Waiting at the Birmingham still they said nevermind we can't get shuttles. We have no one to express our concerns/compliants to so we call the service number and told our hands are tied nothing we can do!? Couldnt help with a shuttle or rental car. You will have to stay the night. I am furious at this point. We finally get to a hotel around 1/2am. We fly out of Birmingham April 1st to head back to ATL. We was told we are stand by for a flight to augusta from ATL but everything is full. My family and I have no idea whats going on. Told us We could fly separate or wait until that flight is ready. We paid over $2400 for our tickets and shuttle to Augusta airport. The lack of care and concern is awful. Delta took no responsibility for what happened. We paid for a flight we didnt get and on top of that a shuttle from atl to Augusta.We will not fly Delta again😡
Date of travel: January 2021,50,Great Flight!,I flew Delta from Washington DC to Salt Lake City for a ski trip during the pandemic. I had a great experience and they did an amazing job of making travelers feel safe with leaving the middle seat open! Masks were required! Would recommend this airline.
Date of travel: November 2020,20,Lost luggage and Rochester airport refused to help.,"On 11/05/2020 my wife and I flew up to Rochester International Airport. We flew on Delta Airlines. We had to make 2 layovers. The last one was at Minneapolis International Airport. Upon arriving at Rochester International Airport we could not find our luggage on the baggage carousel. There was a baggage handler by the baggage carousel. The man was wearing an orange reflective vest and advised that there was not any other luggage on the plane. The man asked us to follow him over to the Delta Airlines ticket counter. The man started looking on the computer. The man could not give me a straight answer. He was not sure where the luggage was and if it would be on the next flight from Minneapolis International Airport. He said if it makes it onto the next flight in a couple hours it would be at the Rochester International Airport around 09:30. The house we were going to was about 18 miles from the airport. I asked if the luggage could be brought out to the house that we were staying at if it arrives around 09:30. The man said no they stop delivering luggage at 10:00. The baggage handle had a very poor attitude and was acting as if it was our fault that the airlines lost our luggage, and we were bothering him by asking for our luggage. I asked if I could speak with a supervisor, but he refused and advised that he was the supervisor. I was very put off by his poor attitude and lack of effort in trying to help us. I mentioned that progressive thinking and putting the luggage on the flight that we were on just isn’t tolerated at Delta Airlines. The baggage handler / supervisor stepped back from the counter and advised that he did not want to or was he going to help us. The baggage handler asked one of the Delta Airline ticket counter employees to help us and then walked away. The ticket counter employee looked at our ticket slips and started typing on the key board. I said to the ticket counter person (I apologize but if they guy before you had apologized for losing our luggage I would not feel so mistreated). The counter person at this time threw the luggage tickets on the counter and then started yelling very loudly that he was not going to help us and that there was no one else in that airport that would help. My wife stepped up to the counter and advised that her father just passed away two days ago and she needs to get home to her mother. The ticket counter person said he doesn’t care and it is not his problem. I stepped outside and called the 800 Delta Airlines customer service phone number. I told her about my concerns and dilemma. She was very polite and on behalf of Delta Airlines she apologized. The phone representative asked me for the luggage tickets and was able to find our luggage in under 30 seconds, and make sure it was going to get on the next flight from the Minneapolis International Airport to the Rochester International Airport. I had to drive back to the airport and be there at 09:30 to get my luggage.  Moral of the story is if you fly Delta Airlines to the Rochester International Airport, Don’t be surprised if your luggage is lost, the people who work there have bad attitudes, just don’t care and will not help you."
Date of travel: April 2021,30,Delta Pricing,"Delta keeps changing their prices on flights every other day, along with baiting consumer only 4 seats left etc... They need to come down on prices, or we will be taking a road trip instead this year."
Date of travel: April 2021,30,The air line stole $13.9,I got refunded $3.80 from $134.80$134.80 (what I paid) ÷2 ( paid for two tickets and use one) −$49.30 (cancelation fee) = $17.7( ideal refund) not $3.80 (what I got refunded. Delta stole $13.9 from me.
Date of travel: April 2021,50,"At both airports, Delta ran smoothly...","Leaving from LAX was very easy, in fact hard to believe easy.  Saturday morning/noon was not very crowded and all the preparations we had made proved useful.  Arriving in Cancun was a surprise, they have made the baggage pickup easier since I last visited two years ago.  A lot of the clutter is gone, now you just exit and turn right for transportation.  A few come up trying to sell you their company but far fewer now.  Leaving on a Saturday was hectic at first, the Delta lines were the longest of any airline, must be doing something right with all these passengers.  But made it through in 1/2 an hour.  Remarkable considering all the forms you have to fill out concerning Covid-19.  Health questionnaires, 5, that your resort should have helped you with, as ours did."
n/a,30,On Time ,"My husband and I took a plane into Salt Lake City. They are one of the few airlines who still have the middle seats blocked, so props to them for that. They had a limited snack offering with a small bottle of water, peanuts and cookies. The plane was not cleaned as efficiently as we hoped. My husband found trash in the seat. The plane was smooth and arrived early to Salt Lake City, though, we did have to sit on the tarmac for a few extra minutes. They had a great in-flight entertainment selection with a great variety of movies and tv to choose from. We also like their corporate stance on the Georgia elections."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,"If you’re thinking about booking with Delta, don’t.","I could have chosen any airline because for once there was not a price difference. I had heard so many great things about Delta I thought traveling with them (for the first time) would be a great/reliable idea considering I told my family I would be home for Easter dinner. I even signed up for SkyMiles I was so excited. What a freaking mistake that was. My flight from SLC to IAH was cancelled. Weird considering our travel partners (traveling to Austin from Bozeman) did not have a cancellation from SLC to Austin. Are you kidding me?! You can get to Austin but not Houston?? Now I have to fly from BZN to SLC to Minneapolis- St. Paul - IAH?!? It is Easter!!! I booked with you because I thought you would be reliable enough based on what I had heard to get me home in time for Easter dinner with my family. You can make it to Austin but not Houston, a major freaking airport hub?! Not only that but you couldn’t get me a seat next to my husband as a small concession or better yet let me talk to a real person? I have called, chatted, redownloaded Twitter, and talked to the gate & no one knows what is going on or can help make this disaster a little less miserable?? It is my first Delta flight & thanks to you I will miss Easter with my family. I will not make that same mistake again and hopefully after this review others won’t either."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Worst airline ever.,"Me and my family planned a great vacation to Hawaii for spring break. Our first stop was in LA and let me just say, the whole crew is just fu**ing rude. On the plane, you’re required to wear a mask at all times and my family knows that. My dad was having a basic conversation with my mom and while he was talking, his mask would slide down and without noticing, he didn’t do anything about it. A flight attendant came and warned my dad and he apologized pulled his mask up. A while later, the same flight attendant came and  my dad with the same incident and started having an attitude with him. Saying “this is the last time I’m warning you.” My mom didn’t appreciate the behavior so she spoke back and asked her to speak nicely Anyway, after that, my dad kept his mask on the ENTIRE time. Once we landed, we were escorted by the manager and she told us that we weren’t able to go on our next flight to Hawaii because of what happened. They then rescheduled our flight for Sunday (2 days later than we were supposed to go). A few hours later, my dad wanted to check us in for the tickets and 3 of the tickets were unavailable. This happened with no warning whatsoever. My dad spent 2 grand for 3 more tickets. We had to spend $125 a person for a new COVID test because they rescheduled our flight. The next day, we got a call from delta saying that all of our flights were canceled and that we aren’t able to fly with delta on this trip. We had to get 3 more extra tickets and you can imagine how much that was. Now our family is taking separate flights. On top of all that, we had to pay for a hotel, food, and transportation all from from our own pockets the two days we’re staying in LA. F*ck delta. This was the most terrible experience I’ve ever had in my life. If you wanna have a good family trip, never use this airline."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Bait & Switch flight and no customer service,I booked the same flight as my brother well in advance of trip. Weeks later Delta emailed me that my flight time had changed. I contacted my brother who said the same happened to him. I assumed we were both moved to the same new flight. Not the case. I found out on the flight out which wasn’t a big deal. However we planned to share a rental and the beach house was far from the airport. I tried calling delta three days in a row. Hold time estimates were over 2 hours each time with the longest at 5 hours. My brother said his flight showed open seats but online when I tried to change my flight it kept saying I could not do so. I ended up biting the bullet and paying $120 to Uber to airport
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Unnaceptable Delta customer service,"Beyond disappointed in Delta - from customer service to plane flight time delays. Highly unnaceptable way ""supervisors"" carry themselves lost and confused.Last supervisor blantly hung up when asked to allow to explain issue. Mrs Bobby's (refused to give employee id) behavior is unnaceptable and should NOT work for Delta."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Ineptitude and Poor Planning,We arrived at the airport at 4:45 a.m. for our 5:40 flight.  When we arrived we were told that our flight had been delayed 5 hours because they didn't have a crew.  Of course ALL of my other reservations had to shift as well.  Our vacation will start an entire day later since we won't arrive until late afternoon instead of 9:30 a.m.  Now we have been told that our pilot has to fly in from Charlotte.  I understand that there are things beyond the control of airlines.  This isn't.  Good news though: they've offered us complimentary water and snacks while we wait.  So we've got that going for us.
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Delta is terrible,The worst sh** I have ever experienced in my life. Never fly delta people are rude as fu**. All they do is try to f**k people’s trips up
Date of travel: May 2020,10,So so bad,"Stay woke delta airlines.  The seats were disgusting, the crew was very rude and of course the flight was late."
Date of travel: April 2021,10,Terrible customer service,Our group had an emergency situation and called the Delta 1 800 number at 3:00PM and received the message that the wait time was 3 hours and 15 minutes.  Their recording said that they could be me back at that time.  I agrees and waited and waited and waited.  At 3:15AM (12 hours later) my cell phone rang and by the time I woke up and got to the phone they had hung up!!!!!!!Never Again!!!
Date of travel: March 2021,40,Delta is the number one airline,"Flew Delta from West Palm Beach Florida to Atlanta.  Hate the face mask requirement but that is not Delta's fault.  I will say they really ""push""wearing the mask on this flight even to the point of saying if you eat take a bite and put the mask back on for each bite.  Seems a little over the top.  Great flight.....on time......I would say good service but they give you water and a snack in first class and that is all......terrible this pandemic......"
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Mrs,"They canceled flight and didn't call to rescheled, had to find out when we arrived at airport. Changed to LMN airlines that canceled their FLT. Flew with a French airline was a night mare all the way around."
n/a,50,Great option during Covid19,"Great flight and service was top notch.      Had a little seating mixup that could have quickly spiraled out of control but flight attendant saw what happened and fixed it even before I could say anything. Now that is why I fly Delta.     Food was non existent during Covid19 they are changing that in two weeks, so I'm not factoring that into my 5 Stars"
Date of travel: March 2021,20,Customer Service is Lacking,"I have filed a Identity Name Change form correctly twice with the appropriate documentation. I have yet to receive a reply and my first name change form was sent over a month ago. I have also contacted the customer service line for Skymiles members twice and have been told it was an over 4 hour hold time. Both times I have waited for over an hour, only to have my phone call unexpectedly disconnected. I now have a flight in 8 days and am very concerned that my name will not be changed in my Skymiles or on my ticket in time. I am very disappointed as Delta typically has wonderful customer service, and I am thinking about using another airline and cancelling my flight."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Actual Customer Service is Non Existent,"Back at the beginning of COVID-19, my flight was canceled and I received a voucher that is only valid for one year. When trying to redeem this voucher to book a flight home, the online services (website and chat) both told me I have to call and speak to someone personally to redeem it. I have been on hold for HOURS AND HOURS waiting just to speak to someone. I have agreed to the ""call back"" feature where they ""keep your place in line"" multiple times and no one ever calls back. I cannot reach anyone. Cannot get the information I need. I feel totally scammed by Delta and so frustrated from wasting so much time trying to find a way to find some answers. Would never book with Delta again after this."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,WHAT A SH#$# AIRLINES,pieces of sh##$@  airlines. Charged twice for same flight .Called said they call back in 2 hours. They called back in 12 hours at 2 in the morning. Cannot talk to an actual person. They sure are playing this covid sh##@t to the max so they don`t have to do anything.
Date of travel: February 2021,30,"Average overall, Covid guidelines could","Understanding that flying during Covid is a personal choice to put yourself at a certain level of risk, Delta could certainly do more to prevent crowding pre-boarding as well as spacing passengers not in the same party better onboard. Other than that, average experience with no major complaints but nothing outstanding"
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Disappointed,I upgraded to Comfort for a bit more leg room and they ended up seating someone right next to me.  I booked Delta because I thought they wouldn't do that.  Very disappointed.
Date of travel: March 2021,10,terrible experience,"First time flying Delta in years. Firs, I tried to call to register my infant. 5-6 hour wait time both times to get through to a representative. No way to register one online. Our stewardess on the flight down was INCREDIBLY demeaning and rude. Our group booked our flights together online and were assigned seats all over the plane. The seats were then switched last minute (still apart) so that we were in the wrong seats and had to switch upon realizing they had been changed. My mom was assigned the same seat as someone else on the flight home. Also on the way home, I was trying to calm my very fussy and tired baby who was grabbing at my mask. Instead of being helpful or kind, the stewardess was mean and nasty and simply  threatened a police escort if I couldn't keep my mask over my nose at all times. Steward offered to let me take my infant seat on the flight but was told (rudely) once I boarded that there was no room. Had to take baby out (no carrier since I was told I could take it on) and take the infant seat back out. There were PLENTY of empty seats and passengers who were willing to switch so that I could sit with my son. I was told ""covid restrictions"" even though they were seating strangers next to each other with no empty seats anywhere around them. It made no sense. Worst experience of my life as far as the unkindness of the staff. My stroller was completely bent and broken when I brought it home from the baggage claim. Will never fly with them again."
Date of travel: March 2021,50,So very professional. Top notch. Thank you fir your service,"My husband and I flew to Orlando on March 25 th. The check in was so easy. When boarding the plane no middle sets were available. They served bags of water and cookies,  The plane was built well. The flight had some turbulence but nothing bad . The professionalism in their dress and attitude was excellent. Even thoughDelta is more expensive you get what you pay for. Thank you Delta. I’m a fan now. Delta Miles here I come."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,All about the money,Customer servi e is no longer a term the airlines use. They don't care as long as they make money.Trying to get around a storm and they had flights that wod but they wanted the money to fly first class. The planes I wS taking there was not one difference between first class and all other seats.They just wanted the money and didn't care one bit about safety or fears.I hope the airline industry fails especially delta. Then when airlines rebuild their selves hopefully they will include customer service and caring. And not be all about the money.To fly a plane with empty seats is stupid Hard on economy and environment when it doesn't ha e to be. Could cut down on most flights if airlines like delta weren't money hungry cold hearted companies.
Date of travel: March 2021,10,“Rescheduled” my flight with no reason ,"I’m an essential employee and have been saving hard to go on a vacation May 15th. My sister has been in the hospital and I’ve been with her every moment I can. I wake up Sunday after a sleepless night in said hospital to find an email that my flight, seven weeks out, had been changed (without explanation) to the worst possible times. 5 HOUR layovers both ways? Leave 6am and get back 11 pm? No thanks!  The email claimed I could pick an alternative flight. I sat on hold for 2.5 hours for a representative. Finally got someone via text, and while they tried to help, there was no alternative flights. I paid for a 6 hour flight, I want a 6 hour flight - not a 10 or 12 hour flight. After dealing with this for hours, I finally get them to say they’ll give me a refund and I took my business to American. Seriously, 7 weeks from my flight? My hotel and transportation all booked? After I paid for it with my hard earned money? And all the good flights were already taken, for all airlines. The amount of stress and time I spent finding an alternative flight on top of my already stressful life is indescribable. I ended up spending more money than I had budgeted because of them. And, no word on why this happened or an attempt to compensate me further. The extra $260 I had to spend would be great! How is that even legal? Do not fly with this airline if you want your plans ruined. It’s like they intentionally tried to ruin my vacation. If I could give 0 stars I would."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Horrible service and very bad manners,I called earlier today to ask question about booking for me and my two animals has I got told I was aloud  to have both and that they would be in cargo and they answered my question well I called again to just make sure we had the right information and they told me about 1-3 hour wait well here it is 11:45pm and they just called me was very very very rude and kept interrupting me and when I asked my questiona she came back with a snobbie way and told me many times no no no... just like that and when I tried to ask my questions again she was very rude still and didn’t care what I was trying to say or ask I’m just trying to see what was better to travel with my animals and it will not be with delta  they don’t deserve any stars -3 it should be
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Bad Customer Service,"Checking in at the airport, the lady at counter MCO was EXTREMELY RUDE. Liliath i believe was her name. Treated me like i was stupid. I gave her my boarding pass and id and I stood there waiting to see what was next, and asked me if I was done. Handed my boarding pass and i.d back. My boyfriend tells me to put the bags on weigh machine so I did. And she proceeded to tell him thank you in a arrogant way. Bad customer service.  Won't book with Delta anymore."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Horrible experience with Delta which is sad as we fly numerous times a year and usually only fly Delta.,"I called Customer service to let them know about our experience which without going into the long details, the flight was horrible causing us a 7 hour layover, getting kicked off the flight and a new flight flying over night. Catee with customer service says they are sorry and there is nothing they can do except for verbally apologize in any of these situations. Jackie did call us to let us know this was a huge miss understanding and we will not be on the do not fly list....I am sorry what? The situation was documented & case interviewed and they sincerely apologize and take responsibility but hope we will be flying again soon. We will not, there is plenty of airlines & our business cards with them are cancelled :) Used to be the best!"
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Modifying flight,I attempted to modify my flight date online.  I required calling the customer service number.  My wait time was between 3-9 hours on the phone.  This is POOR customer service.  I fly monthly and will seek out another airline.
Date of travel: March 2021,20,"Usually good, this flight not so much","We usually fly Delta.  DL 1877 on 3/21/21 STT-MSP 2:25 - 8:26 PM fell well of short of what we expect.  The vents were not on full until about 45 minutes after we boarded.  In general, planes circulate and filter air 12x every hour.  It was hot in the plane.  This much more than a comfort issue.  It is a SAFETY issue.  We were crowded into a big tube with little ventilation.  They'll tell you how they clean the plane between flights.  I could care less about this ""hygiene theater.""  SARS-Cov-2 is a respiratory virus.  I do car about ventilation!!"
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Not happy w/Delta,"Hard to believe...I booked a nonstop flight to minimize time at the airport and in the plane to fly to Boston for medical tests. A member of our party has real trouble flying and we weren't interested in any delays. Delta changed our flight from non-stop to a layover in LaGuardia -- and I'm told I can get an eCredit or change to some other awful layover. We only fly once a year -- an eCredit is essentially a waste. Either honor our tickets as we ordered them or refund our money! Tried to call, left a message, and was told you would definitely call back within 3 hours, 32 minutes -- 4 hours and still waiting. Do better Delta."
Date of travel: March 2021,20,Questionable but not horrible..,"So, I decided to go with delta instead of Jet Blue this time around and maybe I made a mistake. To start off the changed the times of both my flights where I was forced to leave an hour and a half later than my original time and come back and hour earlier. That made me upset because I paid for what I paid for and they just randomly changed it. Next, getting on the flight you get a baggie of let’s just say stuff that no one wants to eat (roasted almonds which people can be highly allergic to like myself). They also give the biscoffs and a mini water bottle. Terrible.On the departing flight back to JFK, I was stopped at the delta boarding gate after my ticket was scanned and was told delta required a random search or certain flyers. IVE NEVER EVER HEARD OF ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE! I’ve flew multiple times and I’ve never been randomly searched at a boarding gate. These people demanded that I take my nearly 2,000 iPad out of its case so they can swipe it for PRINTS?!!??? I demand answers for this from delta even though I called and they claim they have nothing to do with what happened, but they do because it occurred at their boarding gate by their employees. This is unbelievable. Never will fly delta again probably."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Terrible Peope 😡😡😡😡,Their service was very very bad.They din’t help wheelchair.We payed for extra fee’s and they don’t helpThey stole many things.
Date of travel: March 2021,10,all on board had to have a negative Covid test and still masking between bites and sips,"Delta's policy seems to have changed since Jan 2021 for this same flight both to and from Cancun. All flights out of Mexico require a negative Covid test. Flight attendant's announcement stated we don't care if you are negative, had the vaccine or recovered and therefor immune, you will wear your mask and put it on between bites of food and sips. This is not even healthy and very absurd. Mask studies that the CDC won't tell you about is that mask or no mask, infection rates are the same and have shown in some studies with flu actually increase the rate of infection with mask wearing. So why so bitchy about wearing between bites and sips? Can no longer recommend this airline. Would like to know if others are doing the same, websites don't state this type of requirements."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Rude Counter Attendant,"My husband went to the Dayton Airport to ask about changing flight information as we had an emergency suddenly come up. The attendant at the Delta counter could not have been more rude. He was clearly bothered by my husband's questions. If my husband would have reacted, I'm sure airport security would have been called. Why is it ok for Delta's employees to be extremely rude to paying customers? Are they aware that the people buying the tickets provides money for payroll checks? This will be our last flight on Delta. Their employees are extremely miserable and clearly take forgranted where their paychecks actually come from, people like my husband buying tickets. Customer Service has definitely taken a nose dive with Delta. If you need someone to train your employees in stellar Customer Service, call me. They seriously need training. Remember, they represent the core values of your company. Sad representation of your values today at the Dayton, Ohio Airport."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Mrs,"The worst flight I have ever had. Belligerent angry flight attendant looking for a fight. Chastising me for not having my mask on.. While eating and drinking their cheap wine. After she confronted me, I did put my mask on, as I always wear one and have no problem With it. Just thought while I was eating and drinking as everyone else was, it was ok to not have on. She proceeded to come back and yell at me some more for being so rude/ clearly disgruntled with anger problems. People who spend thousands on first class tickets don’t appreciate this. Delta, spend some time teaching your employees basic manners."
Date of travel: March 2021,50,Delta Doing Well,Boston Delta Club was very nice... the flight too.  I love that Delta is still providing Covid Seating...ie. middle seat blocked.  TV at the seat was great... live TV was appreciated.  Beer and Wine served in their premium section.
Date of travel: March 2021,20,Move my daughtet,"I gave up my ticket and opted to fly on another flight the next day.Delta said they were giving gift cards, Visa, MC, Amex or cards that could be used through Delta.I opted for the Visa card. They came electronically with no instructions on activation. Access to the customer service line had a 7+ hour wait for a representative.After figurung out how to download the card,  I went to use it and discovered that it is inly redemable for new tickets or by purchasing through Delta.comThe inconvenience of delaying my trip for the ""gift"" of a virtually unusable card ( 1've flown 2 times in the past 7 years) was an abdolute disappointment. I wonder if any of the other 5 prople bumped that flight are as dissappointed as I am.???Inconvenience and poor communication are getting to be the norm and it's sad. We could all use a lot more transparency and actual honesty... of course that wouldn't fill the pockets of the higher ups."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,Ticket rebooking,"I am extremely unsatisfied with my flight rebooking. When visiting MN I had to rebook my ticket to a later date because when I was seeing my grandmother, she end up passing away on my visit. Didn't know this was going to happen. Yet there was no flexibility on charges or anything when changing my flight. On top of that, there were so many complications when trying to reschedule my flight it was horrible. it took an hour on the phone because of technical difficulties on their end. Definitely, the last time I use Delta!"
n/a,40,Nice Planes - March 2021,"I've recently had several travel legs on Delta. All flights were on B737s or A321s. All the planes were in great shape and the flight crews were nice. All the crews were adhering to pandemic protocols and they still don't assign anyone in the center seat unless it's a family traveling together.So, I don't know if others have noticed that the aisle has become a little bit tighter over the years. I know all the carriers are packing in the number of seats these days but that's not much of a problem if you're under 5' 5"". I really like the entertainment systems built into the seats. There are numerous options for you from watching movies to playing games to monitoring your flight progress. You can even play multiplayer games if you know the seat number(s) of those you want to challenge. Earphones are complementary...just ask! There's also WiFi available for a fee.They provided a small snack bag that comes with a small bottle of water and crackers (or similar). All my flights were on schedule. No problem flying with Delta in the future."

They switched our seats minutes before boarding so we could be together. Additionally, they allowed us to check extra bags, free of charge, to make us more comfortable.Staff was very pleasant and gave great customer service!Very refreshing to see in the travel industry. Highly recommend."
Date of travel: March 2021,10,John Mulaney was right,"Not serving drinks ""due to covid precautions"", but they served to first class. What a statement. Apparently first class customers are less likely to transmit covid via purchasing drinks. And apparently lower income customers don't deserve to relax during the flight. I've never flown delta and won't again."
Date of travel: March 2021,50,Really Impressed ,"I use to fly a lot, this is my first flights since Feb. 2020.. I am a Delta Gold member, I have also never written an airline review before. Each flight I took this week was amazing, each aircraft was spotless, I mean I said to my girlfriend look how clean the carpet is. I actually started looking for any sign of dirt grime etc. Nothing....They gave us sanitizer on arrival and throughout the crew were awesome and made us feel very safe...Thanks"
Date of travel: March 2021,20,"Always book 2 one-way tickets on Delta!
Understand their penalty for booking round-trip.","I want to warn other people about Delta’s penalty for customers purchasing a round-trip domestic ticket and highly encourage two one-way domestic tickets instead.There is no financial benefit to purchasing a round-trip ticket, it is simply the sum of 2 one-way tickets.There is a great penalty for having booked a round-trip with delta... if you want to make a change to one segment of your trip, Delta will re-price both portions of the ticket and charge you their current increase in price.For example, say you bought a round-trip ticket for $200 (each one-way priced at $100) and you later want to cancel the return flight. In order to do this, Delta will re-price the departure flight to today’s price (even though you’re not changing that segment) and charge you accordingly. Let’s say that new one-way departure flight is $220. Delta will tell you that you OWE them money to change to a one-way ticket.Had you booked 2 one-way tickets, you could cancel the return and hold on to a voucher for $100.Even if you wanted to just change a portion of your flight, you will be much better off having two separate tickets. That way you won’t be penalized with two increases of fare just to change one segment. Delta claims to be like other airlines with a no change fee, but they clearly still have predatory pricing policies in place to beef up their profits.Huge difference. Please always book 2 one-way tickets if you must fly Delta! I hope this helps someone not get caught like I did."

Coming back my flight time was changed again. No biggy. BUT THEN- 12 hours before my flight I got notified via email (good thing I check it every few hours). My flight was delayed by 2 DAYS. I called the airlines and there wasn't another flight that worked within my covid test window. It didn't matter that I was military and had orders to be backSo I scrambled to set up an appointment for another covid test. I was calling my supervisor and 1st shirt to tell them what was happening. Not trying to get an AWOL on my record. Had to figure my new ride to the Airport, and plans for another 2 days in Phoenix. 3 changes for 1 trip, and the last change was a headache. Look s**t happens, I get it.

Date of travel: March 2021,20,Terrible loss of family friendliness,"With the current pandemic, this is the first round trip we have taken with our family, and we paid for main cabin tickets to ensure our family of 4 (two adults, two elementary school) would be able to sit together.For our departure flight, Delta service from Minneapolis was excellent. However, our return trip has started extremely poorly. The computer first socially distanced our tickets and then we were shuffled again to accommodate an infant in arms. In calling customer service, we were then less important than other single passengers. Our final solution was to try to switch seats when boarding the plane. We were also given the “opportunity” to apply for the Skymiles Gold card with special deals - however when transferred on the phone to American Express, the same deals weren’t available!Our return trip has started as a disaster already - and we are seriously reconsidering Delta as a family friendly option."

All staff very friendly, excellent technology to track and text you updates on location of your baggage (check in, on plane, off plane, baggage carousel #, etc...), informative when delayed and went out of their way to help each passenger find connecting gate information BEFORE landing, planes were newer and had screens in the seat backs and outlets to charge devices (also nice they provided complimentary headphones if needed!)."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Please pay my money back,"I booked a flight from CPT to SFO in November, the flight was for end of December. When I went to add an extra piece of my luggage to my flight, the flight wasn't showing up. They had cancelled the whole route without even notifying me. If I hadn't wanted an extra bag, I would have only found this out 24 hours before my flight when wanting to check in. I was then promised a refund as the fault was on their side. I filled out all the paperwork immediately as I don't have enough money to rebook international flights without first getting that money back. It has now been over three months and I still don't have my money. Everytime I call they have a different story. I am at my wits end. If anyone has any advice on how to get my money back, that would be much appreciated. Safe to say, I won't be booking through them again."

He told me I could cancel for any reason, as long as I do so before midnight the next day. The holds on my credit card would just fall off. Something came up, and I had to cancel. I DID cancel, online, successfully. The next day the holds turned into permanent charges. I tried to call Delta, waited on hold once for 3 hours, the next day for longer. HOW DO I GET MY MONEY BACK??? I told my cc company I will NOT pay Delta, but that's going to be a painful, long process."

Delta canceled the flight and moved 4 of us to the 8 a.m. flight and 2 of us to the 10:24 a.m. flight.  They have business class open on the 8 a.m. flight but will not move the other 2 to the 8 a.m. flight without us paying the additional cost.  I did not asked to have my flight moved.  Now I have to incur additional expenses on rental vehicles and I won't be there to assist my daughter who comes in through Atlanta with her infant son.

I had shirts with tags still on them, name brand bras, expensive make-up, a pair of jeans. STOLEN!! I know they are just materialistic items but when I land and have to do buy everything again, it pisses me off!!!!! Then when I tell them, nothing but an I'm sorry. How about a gift card or something to help replace the items. Not like it's not a multi-billion dollar company. They act like they care about their passengers but they don't. They did tell me that I had to contact them within the 24 hours and I can say that I did not but it was because my husband was in a snow mobile accident and I my husband's life was more important at the time than to make a phone call. They also know this and of course, nothing. This is why I don't fly."

My husband and I had a trip to Europe scheduled for May 2021. We had rescheduled this trip many times due to Covid, unfortunately, and had been so looking forward to it. While we were so sad to cancel and miss out on the trip of a lifetime, we had to put our travel on hold because we have the opportunity to adopt a child! In this instance, every penny counts. While we thought we may receive vouchers for our trip- which who knows when we will be able to use with a new child at home- we emailed Delta and they quickly and kindly responded that they would refund our tickets! This has been the biggest blessing at this time in our life. They were so kind and celebratory, and it truly made our day.

In my experience the SLC based crew did an exceptional job and the 767 is very comfortable.The crew were warm and friendly, almost as if it were a different airline compared to our flight from LAX. Seats were comfortable and lots of movies for the overnight flight. Once I speak with the family who was taken off the flight at LAX in my previous review and see how Delta resolved the debacle I will be able to give a different numerical rating."

If I had know the lack of consistency in service between those 2 carriers, I would not have checked my blanket in my checked bag!By Covid times, Delta goes definitely low and cheap.Service on board was inexistant.

Date of travel: July 2020,10,Lost Luggage while Returning From Military Deployment,"🚨🚨🚨UPDATE: 🚨🚨🚨Delta Air Lines has offered a total compensation of $650 and a $300 airline voucher, which we will most assuredly not be using after this experience. The value of the items that Delta Air Lines lost is actually over $2800 - a larger claim than most because of the extended timeframe of the deployment, and the bag contained a large amount of gifts/household items/military goods. We are now in the process of filing a lawsuit against them for the return of our property or the full balance worth of items that were lost. Please feel free to share our story!TLDR//: mil family has to sue Delta because they won’t pay for the bag they lost over 8 mos agoHusband got home from a lengthy deployment in July 2020. Found out that somewhere along the way, Delta had lost his bag, the one that he had been living out of for months so it was chock full of uniforms, personal items, etc. Eight months later, we are now THREE claims in, two digital and one physical paper copy (because Delta kept telling us they had “lost” our claim), and have received no payment or updates. We have contacted base legal to try and settle things amicably, but again, no action/response from Delta. The next steps are SUING DELTA for the cost of the lost bag and its contents. For shame. A multibillion dollar company can’t figure out how to recompense a military family in the middle of a pandemic in which families, including ours, are struggling with finances and job loss. It’s been 8 months, and we can’t afford to not be paid for what Delta lost. Eight months of being ignored and patronized. Sounds like a nice way to pay back a military member, right?Delta Air Lines #delta #deltaairlines"
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Honestly the worst flight experience ever,"Delta Air LinesI would rather rent a Uhaul and drive than fly with Delta🤮🤮🤮Please read. It is long but Delta created a huge problem for a family on our flight.They were mistreated. The behavior and treatment by these Delta employees was absolutely despicable!Tues 2/16/21: SLC to Maui direct flight delayed, then cancelled due to some mechanical issue. This was after we had boarded and taxied out to the runway. Delta put us up in hotels but the event was a nightmare for several families with young children. We were rebooked for 2/17 to fly to Maui via LAX and once we were at the departure gate (A25 I believe) we met up with a young family from the night before. They had two younger children and a three month old infant. The parents looked very tired after getting into a hotel quite late and getting up early for the flight.Once we boarded and were seated on the plane the baby started crying and I could tell that the mother was very focused on calming the infant. I visited with the husband for a minute while other passengers were coming on board, then settled into my seat. It was uncomfortably warm on the plane but I assumed (incorrectly) that once the engines started it would cool down. The two male flight attendants who initially greeted us were cheery. However the flight attendant at the rear of the plane was noticeably unfriendly. About the time the doors were closed I noticed the lead flight attendant came to the rear of the aircraft several times. He was rather easy to remember because he was wearing safety glasses/goggles. It seemed odd since everyone was seated and we were waiting to back away from the gate. And it was very warm. After 15 to 20 minutes of waiting I noticed some activity at the door where we entered the plane. Another flight with mechanical issues??? This cannot be happening again. Then I noticed a woman in a Delta uniform worn by ground crew come on board. I’m wondering if they are having a problem with a passenger since there had been no mention of a reason for this delay. It was really confusing since everyone was in their seats waiting to take off. Then this Delta employee who came on board headed toward the rear of the plane. She addresses the father seated behind me and confirms who is flying with him and says that she needs them to gather their baggage and come with her. Everyone seated in the rear of the plane is completely stunned. The father asks what is going on and he is advised that his wife was asked four times by the crew to wear her mask.He responds that she was asked by the flight attendant ONCE to wear her mask correctly and she had complied.Neither the family seated directly behind them nor my wife and I noticed her ever not wearing her mask. I would have noticed since I had been turned around visiting with the father who was seated directly behind me and I could see the wife holding the infant. An older couple seated directly in front of the mother confirmed that they had never seen her mask off.The assertion that she was asked four times is a lie. A COMPLETE LIE. A fabrication. The unfriendly flight attendant had spoken with her once. The lead flight attendant who came to the rear of the plane several times NEVER spoke with her. Every time I saw the mother she had her mask on. Not one passenger in that area of the plane noticed her with her mask off!All the passengers nearby began to question this Delta employee who had been sent to take this family off the plane. Not a bit of understanding or compassion, or acknowledgement of the difficulty Delta had caused due to the cancelled flight.We all stated that we had not observed her with her mask off. It was beyond belief. At that point I began to record the event with my phone. I explained to this woman the situation regarding the canceled flight late the night before, the early flight to LAX, etc. Honestly this young mother was probably exhausted at this point. However the Delta employee who was in the process of escorting this family off the plane seemed to be intentionally speaking very quiet. Honestly I think this may be a tactic that Delta has initiated in order to make it more difficult to record the conversations during situations like this. As the family gathered their things the passengers seated near them exchanged phone numbers. However as soon as they were escorted off the plane a passenger from a few seats in front of us came back and took over the row that had been vacated by the mother and her children. We pointed this out to the flight attendant and ask if we could change seats as we pleased and her comment was “don’t start this while we are trying to take off”. She never addressed the issue with us after take off. Once airborne it was still quite stuffy and warm so we ask her if they could get the ventilation system working to cool things off. She never returned to address either issue.So my analysis of the situation is this. Delta was very focused on passengers wearing masks. Good for them. Too bad they don’t put the same effort toward having a comfortable environment on the plane. I assume that the flight attendant did speak with the mother about her mask once, however with the baby crying, the hightemperature on board, and not least due to some level of exhaustion since Delta had cancelled their direct flight the day before.... the mask may have slipped down a bit. Possibly. However no one saw it. She was preoccupied with caring for the infant. That was my observation. Everyone I spoke with on the flight concurred.The ambient temperature in the cabin was warm for the whole flight. Warm, stuffy and again... uncomfortable.The mini water bottles and snacks were packaged as if we were on a school field trip for first grade. Honestly Goldfish and mini water bottles??? The worst commercial flight I have ever been on.However this is nothing.... nothing in comparison to the shabby treatment shown to this family. Despicable"
Date of travel: February 2021,10,If you want a stressful trip book with Delta,We had over 6 flight changes and 2 airlines we finally made it to our destination. We were scheduled to leave at 6 am and never left Phoenix until 7pm that night. When we checked in they did a ticket exchange with American Airlines for a one way to LAx to then connect us on a delta flight to our final destination. They allowed only 45 minutes for us to travel out of the terminal and back through security to board a delta flight in one of the largest airports. Completely unacceptable. (I was with my elderly mom) I knew we would not make it and I tried calling delta but couldn’t get ahold of them as they had a 4 hour wait time for assistance and being in a different terminal no customer care desk. I ended up going to the American Airlines counter and they were more than willing to assist me and booked me a direct flight to Spokane. Finally got there after a 14 hour day traveling. Originally booked with delta for the seat space with the pandemic but ended up being packed full in the American Airlines flight. Even contacting delta customer care after our trip ended and voiced my concerns. They could care less. They had no sense of customer first nor did they care that I could possibly be a returning customer. Flight attendants are rude and inconsiderate. No empathy with customers.  I understand Mother Nature and the weather delays but the airlines same issues year after year and never change. They have you in between a rock and a hard spot  and they either wanna help you or not. They could care less if I make it to my destination. I will never travel with delta again- gave them a last chance on the customer care center. P.s. had to pay for double baggage fees because they booked us on 2 airlines. Had to call and fight with them multiple times just to get a credit on the fee.
Date of travel: February 2021,50,Delta In Cabin for Pets,"So I have read many reviews in regards to flying your pet in cabin on Delta Airlines and my mind was completely twisted on what to do with positive and negative ratings. I will tell you that my experience with this today was by far the best flying experience I have ever had in regards to flying on an airline with a pet. To start with from the TSA agents, Flight Attendant’s and everyone else that was involved with delta airlines they were all a grand slam!!!! I’m sure that all people’s attitudes are different but I can’t rave enough about the way these people were committed to doing there jobs and helping the whole way through. Once in the plane the Flight attendants were so interactive with us I had the puppy on my lap the whole time throughout the flight and even the people in the cabin were good with it, I can say speaking from my own experience Delta is an extreme class act and I highly recommend them. The only negative thing I would say is that the plane was one of their smaller planes and it wasn’t very roomy in the seat and having the kennel under the seat in front of me there was barely any leg room to move around.Also another tip for anyone that is flying with any airline, do yourself a favor and buy a soft sided kennel and freeze a very, very small bowl of water and let it defrost in the kennel with the puppy so they can drink from it and also wee-wee pads!! Hope this helps...."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,DIRTY airplane,"Horrified from our last flight on Sunday from Delta. The airplane did not appear to be cleaned and upon looking up to adjust the air that was very evident. There was barely any air coming out due to a blockage from a thick yellow waxy substance built up on the inside. There also was the appearance of black mold around the rotating base of the vent. This was after having a delay and change of plane and the gate agent saying the plane just landed but that it would be completely cleaned and ""fogged"" before boarding would begin. And the stewardess announcement promoting ""new standard of cleanliness.. wiping down all surfaces.. advanced air filtration"" Having to deal with covid and now an additional hazard of breathing in mold spores is not what I expect especially with all the added focus on additional cleaning and steps being taken for customer safety and health."

This is TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. Meanwhile my flight itinerary is now erroneously auto-rebooked stranding me in Detroit.

I'm sure they might sell the same seat to someone else.
Date of travel: February 2021,40,Very Empty Flight,"Overall the flight was very good. There were pre checks which the majority did early but she turned up late for them, delaying the flight slightly. Boarding was a tad chaotic with instructions given then changed.Flight was empty and service was very good."
Date of travel: February 2021,40,Good efficient and well handled flight,"I booked this trip as a last minute thing. Check in was quick an efficient, as was going through security.They boarded the plane back to front to avoid congestion. Onboard Erica the flight attendant was very efficient and clear with instructions, just a pity some passengers ignored them.Flight was good  but be aware if you have a connecting flight at Atlanta that is international then it takes a while to get to the other terminal. Plus the shuttle is outside so dress up warm."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,WORST EXPERIENCE,"My partner and I were flying to D.C. for Christmas, and ended up missing the holiday and arriving to our destination a day late. They continued to delay our flight even the morning of our departure. We were supposed to leave Iowa at 11 am, and did not end up leaving until 8pm ONLY TO BE STUCK IN MICHIGAN OVERNIGHT. Absolutely ridiculous. Not only this, but when they gave us vouchers for a hotel stay the shuttle driver denied us service, stating that Delta is giving out invalid vouchers. Thankfully we found someone to help us before all Delta employees left. Worst experience ever, we asked for compensation to our original form of payment and they denied it because we did not miss our destination by 24 hours (which is ridiculous because we did not get there the day we payed for). Will never be flying with Delta again, WORST EXPERIENCE."
Date of travel: February 2021,40,We love Delta!,"So I will start by writing that our flight TO MSP was amazing. The attendants were so sweet and accommodating. The seats were spaced apart and they were quick to fix when people were walking around unmasked. As a nurse traveling during a pandemic I was happy things were taken seriously. Our flight back however was not good. While the majority of the staff was exceptional there was an older flight attendant who was a huge grump and honestly, if you work in the service industry (as I had for 15 years) you need to keep your emotions in check. I had expected my family of four would have a whole row to themselves as we did in the first flight, but instead we didn’t. I mentioned to the stewardess that sitting two feet max from a stranger was worrisome and she stated in a very snide voice “it will be fine!” I replied “No, it’s not fine.” I shut my mouth and sat down, but the rest of the flight she wouldn’t help me. Honestly, maybe it’s time she got a new job. I am generally a very nice person but I did not like her tone or dismissive behavior. I realize I am choosing to fly in a pandemic BUT precautions still need to be made, and staff professional.I loved the fact that we had personal televisions and that we could even watch movies that were just released. I have flown with nearly every airline and I really do enjoy Delta. I feel that the crew for the most part is excellent and enjoys their work as much as one can enjoy work. The flight was on time with minimal trouble boarding. We appreciated the crew and what they are doing for us during this pandemic.We will fly Delta again."
Date of travel: February 2021,50,Flying as safe as possible,Delta is flying with the middle seat empty and the attendant will hand you a disinfectant wipe to clean your seat and hands. Flew Southwest back home and were crammed into a 160 passenger plane and every seat was full
Date of travel: February 2021,50,Bartender,I just wanted to thank gate agent Lisa Woolley for going over and above by reconnecting the gangway to go on board a plane and finding the iPad I’d left on board.  Lisa Woolley is the greatest!!!
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Bad customer service,"I bought 2 tickets and cancelled 5 days later, they said I will not get a refund. My grandmother passed away and they said I could not get a refund. Very bad company to deal with."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Why do they lie to us?,"Why is it that when there is an issue with the plane, Delta felt that it is ok to board everyone just to back away from the gate and sit.  Only to make an announcement that there is a problem with the work previously performed. Now we can't even find other arrangements to get home.  Breathing in covid infested air. This airline just makes me sick. Why not be honest with their customers and the faa about flight statistics.  I guess I will dump Delta and stick with Southwest airlines."
Date of travel: November 2020,50,Made us happy and calm,"To the staff and crew, especially the ones worked on Nov 08 2020 (I'm a little late) flight number DL412, THANK YOU SO MUCH, ALL of you were super nice and helpful.... One of my kids has medical condition and can not wear mask. I called different airlines with no luck and all required masks, even for a child with medical condition and with notes from two doctors and hospitals. Even one of the supervisors from a different airline yelled at me when I repeated my question for kids with medical condition. I don't name the rude supervisor and don't name that airline (Jet blue) ...Delta crew were SO NICE, SO NICE AND SO NICE to us and helped us out. Made us comfortable in that stressful situation. TO ALL OF YOU, THANK YOU :)"
Date of travel: February 2021,10,DELTA NIGHTMARE,"I flew quite a bit in my life, never in my life have I experienced such a nightmare. They operated a flight on behalf of Air France, not only did they get my name wrong in the first place (which is right on the AirFr website) they boarded my luggage without me (probably not knowing I was supposed to be on that flight at all). Baggage lost, I reschedules for the next day to the same destination, everything looked fine untill I presented myself to the gate and they said the tickets are there but something is wrong on the ""system"" go see or call airfrance..what followed was a horrible back and forth but what struck me is the utter incompetence of the Delta staff. Completely careless for the issue, speaking very slow and not being able more than 2 senrances worth of info before they get confused. honestly, they were not trying to understand. When the flight boarded they looked sideways and left me there with a number to call. Horrible horrible experience, never flying with Delta again, never dealing with these incompetent lazy people again."
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Will not take responsibility of AeroMexico First Class Fare,"I booked 5 first class tickets on AeroMexico. AeroMexico paid Delta for these fares. On the way home Delta delayed our flight for over 5 hours which left us stranded in Detroit for our connecting flight. The NEXT day they flew us home but did not have first class available. I was told by the Delta agent I would be compensated for the difference in airfare. Instead Delta denied our claim and told us to go back to AeroMexico and of course AeroMexico said Delta is responsible because they were paid for our first class travel. Here are their responses:Hello Amy, RE: Case Number 36168424 Thanks for contacting us. I’m happy to help with your request regarding 1392118351230, 1392118351231, 1392118351232, 1392118351233, 1392118351234.

Sincerely, Daen Arturo Peñuelas LópezCustomer Care RepresentativeSo there you have it both carriers got their money and left me hanging out to dry! Pretty sad considering I paid over $15,000 for my families tickets."
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Delta Stole My Money,"I purchased 3 tickets for $302.20 and was charged this amount 6 times by Delta. I have receipts for the 3 tickets, not for 6 tickets. I reported this to my bank and Delta disputed the claim. I have not been able to get a hold of any representatives at Delta. I will not be flying Delta ever again."
Date of travel: February 2021,20,If there were any other options I would Never fly delta,"I have to travel for work quite often. I have been on 6 work trips since the new year and Delta always disappoints me. The staff is wonderful and the only real saving grace. I fly delta going through Atlanta moatly and there aways seems to be something wrong with my plane. The plane doesn't have enough gas, there is an undisclosed matiance issue, the runway is full or the gate is full so we wait an extra 30 minutes to take off or get off. On my current flight they also cant seem to be bothered to update us or their app. Time is valuable to everyone and Delta's time selection was what got me to buy their tickets and then they can't seem to deliver on their end without making me late or almost late the last 3 times I have flown with them."
Date of travel: February 2021,10,Deteriorating fleet - 2 DAY DELAY,"The customer service has been mediocre with Delta for many years, but there is a precipitous deterioration of the fleet of airplanes that makes it nearly impossible to fly Delta. On this round trip, I was delayed coming and going. In fact, on one international flight we were delayed TWO DAYS because of a hydraulic issue. Then we were delayed for 2 hours from JFK to ATL on an intercom system. These planes are just falling apart."
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Destroyed belongings and baggage,"Broken kids virtual tablets , breastpumbs , personal belongings , zero care whatsoever for your belongings and zero care to replace them .. very disappointing and have cancelled my sky miles ... you're very well known and make it right ... won't even get into their outdated international place .. sad sad sad ..."
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Director of marketing,Glad Delta takes COVID seriously. 😂 Packed on the sketchy plane like sardines. NEVER flying again!!
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Absolutely horrible customer service.,"The gal workin the ticket gate 1/28/21 should not have a job!! Completely rude and disrespectful. We had debris flown into our planes engine which caused a delay. The connection flight would be missed so anyone that needed to make new plans needed to come forward. Our group went up and was told to sit down. This happened 3 more times, while others got vouchers to stay in Key West. Plane finally was able to board and we were told we had no other options except to board because our luggage was on the plane and it was leavin. Funny thing about that our luggage never made it on the plane to Atlanta."
Date of travel: August 2020,50,Trip,We flew Delta from Harrisburg Pa to Las Vegas with a connection in Detroit.Both Flights were wonderful.On the way Back My Wife lost her cell phone. We told the gate agent about it and when we got on the Plane the flight agent said to my Wife if there is anything we can do to help let us know. Fantastic customer service.
Date of travel: January 2021,30,Slow service,Flew from JFK to PUJ. The check in machines do not print your luggage rages you have to wait online for a long time. Our flight was blended with another flight and wasted about 45 min online.
Date of travel: December 2020,20,I wasn't happy with how the crew handled a situation,"Delta is usually one of my favorite airlines and their staff is very polite and the seats are amongst the comfiest. On my short flight from Salt Lake City to St. George, UT I was not happy with my experience at all. We are coming in to land and we are less than 50 feet off the ground (estimating our altitude) about to land and all of a sudden we throttle out of it and pull up the gear. From a passenger perspective, we have no idea what is going on and we go back up to a couple thousand feet and circle back around. We eventually land about 20 minutes later, but the frustrating thing was that nobody ever said anything or told us what had happened. Not even as we got off the plane. I know the pilots are busy circling back around and what not, but there are 2 of them and surely somebody could've gotten on the mic and told everyone what was going on. At least tell us there isn't a mechanical issue and the wind knocked you off course or something....it added a lot of stress to my trip."
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Bad experience,"So our flight was delayed and pushed 12 hours going into the next day. Delta informed us to go to a hotel but we would have to pay for it. I had to sleep inside the terminal. The following day at 0600 we went to another terminal to get on our plane. When we go there, their was no help. But they keeping changing the boarding time from 0745, 0845, 0945, 1015. The employee that worked there had no clue what she was doing. I did not feel comfortable in her experience or judgement. She briefly kept us inform. She rarely stayed at the desk to help people. Once it hit 1015, the pilots show up and it looked like they are confused on what they need to do. I'm sorry but I have spend 36 hours in the airport trying to see my family who I haven't seen in two years. I would never want to fly delta again"
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Third time Delta has lost baggage,I have no idea why Delta continues to loose my baggage. This is the latest dismal service from a terrible airline. I WILL NEVER FLY DELTA EVER AGAIN!! Also the food service was terrible.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Good Airline! Value for money,I have seen Delta improve its customer experience consistently to a point that it is my favorite airline now. Texting customer service is incredibly efficient and their agents provide the best customer service of any airline in the US and possibly the world.
Date of travel: January 2021,20,Too many flights booked for departure and not proper spacing,"Let me start by saying that I love flying with Delta. However, on my recent flight traveling from Orlando, Fl to Cincinnati, proper social distancing was not followed. For example, 4 different Delta flights were all scheduled to depart at 7:59pm in the same terminal. This created chaos and major crowds in the terminal, which did not allow for social distancing. Why are flights scheduled to depart at the same time? It was just unnecessary! Also, flight attendants did not make sure that masks were worn at all times except when eating or drinking. The passenger in the row ahead had his mask off the entire flight and nothing was said. Very disappointed!"
Date of travel: January 2021,20,Ridiculous ,Waited 1 hour at the gate because the “push back” truck broke down. I sat in 5 different seats before I found a video screen that worked. Plans are old and service is poor.
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Customer is always wrong,Delta Employees have become total jerks. I was told by Tim toys in a row to screw myself more or less when we are about to miss our flight.
n/a,50,Still My Go To Airline,"After several years of flying Delta as a Diamond Medallion Member, I can atill say that Delta is still my go to first choice. Tonight's flight was no exception (first leg). I normally do not do two stops or a red-eye but after changing this flight multiple times, I was a bit stuck on the choices. My flight attendant tonight was absolutely amazing. A quick turn from SEA to ONT and back from Ontario to Seattle, this crew assisted on preparing the aircraft for a quick turn then provided such a hugh level of service. I was a bit dissapointed at first when I arrived at Sea-Tac as I wanted to check out the Centurion Club. I checked their hours prior to leaving (not on their website) but they were closed when I arrived. Fortunately, I stumbled onto one of the nicest Delta Skyclubs I have been in. Most Skyclubs are similar but all have their personalities. This one is no different. I have to sayn this one is one of the frontrunners for my favorites. The food; sandwiches, soup, single serve sides, were all good. The wonderful young lady that was hosting was so pleasant. She made you feel very welcomed. I have attached a few pictures of the artwork. Such detailed pencil carvings. Thanks again Delta. You never fail to deliver."
Date of travel: January 2021,50,Gotta Love Delta,"We bought tickets to Aruba back in June.  We were set to go the last weekend of January but decided on Saturday that we could not make the trip.  Called Delta that afternoon to cancel.  We had has a few schedule changes over the last few months but nothing to severe.  When we called the agent said they would just refund me the money and not issue a credit.  We received the credit back on my CC today, 4 days later.  Thank you Delta.  Just another reason I fly you almost exclusively.  Great Service!!!"
Date of travel: January 2021,10,DELTA employee stole my Chanel bag and Louis Vuitton bag from my checked luggage.,I recently flew this past weekend from PHX to MIA. I had 4 designer bags in my suitcase. I purposely hidden the bags in another zipper with a towel over it. When I received my luggage I discovered that my Chanel jumbo and Louis Vuitton bumbag was gone from my luggage. I am now seeing another person who experienced the same issue. How could Delta not reimburse or even fire and charge the thief! This is horrible and every one is moving so slow on my file case. Please help!
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Horrible customer service,Absolutely horrible treatment at the delta desk from a female with the name tag “Bessy” never been treated so poorly she refused me to fly when I shouldn’t  have been. Cost me 2 nights in a hotel and 3 days in a large city by myself with no family or friends. Insisted my covid test was in the wrong time frame and we have looked into it and I was not in the wrong with my time line. Hope she loses her job.
Date of travel: December 2020,20,Delta Rep- Dishonest & Disrespectful,"I have flown with Delta for years. I am a United States veteran who loves airlines, does not always think the customer is always right, and will bend over backwards to consider everything. For the first time in my life- a Delta Representative (Rhonda: Aberdeen, SD Regional Airport) did more than just not do her job- she was on a power trip, lied, and made sure I wasn't going to get on my intended flight. I had a flight going out on Dec. 27th at 610AM- and was going to be back in Philadelphia by 130PM. I showed up on time with my service dog, tried checking in my bag, but there was no Delta Rep at the front desk. I proceeded to talk to TSA- asking where I should check in at- and they said I had to wait for the Delta Rep to come out from behind the back. When she (Rhonda/ 866656200/ 969094) did finally come out to her desk- she immediately accused me of being late. I told her that I was not and had to wait on her- which she did not take well at all. After trying to reason with her- she made the following statement: ""I could let you on this flight- but I'm not going to."" Due to the pandemic and being in a small town- there were no Taxi, Uber, or Lyft service(s) available. I was denied my flight, made to stay in the airport for hours (with it being freezing and below freezing temperatures outside), and without any transportation to go anywhere more suitable. I left that little airport at 530PM. By the time I got back to Philadelphia (well after midnight and living 45 minutes from the airport)- I barely got any sleep before I had to get up for work. I wrote Delta a few days later- explaining my situation. They denied me any sort of compensation- didn't even issue an apology. This is too bad- especially that I have flown with them for years. I have testimony from TSA and Aberdeen Airport employees that said that Rhonda is a bad Delta Rep and needs to be reported. I even took the matter to the Aberdeen Police and got a report written up- in case I decide to take this to court. If the weather or unforeseen circumstances causes a delay- totally understood and acceptable. But when a Delta Rep delays you on purpose- to fulfill her inner power trip- that is not acceptable at all."
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Terrible accountability,"I used to fly nothing but delta, I’ll never fly with them again. I was on vacation, my cards got hacked, I had to leave early. Changed my flight, it was cheaper so I got a 69.10 credit, they charged my card that amount instead, it was part of all the money I had left that I had access to because of my information being stolen. They admitted multiple times they never should have charged my card, it was a mistake. The bank says they can’t refund it, delta has to, delta says they can’t do anything. Now I can’t Uber home, I’m short $70, they wouldn’t do anything, twice they just said oh well and hung up. I borrowed from the only person I could, everyone else I know is gone. That cost me more than the 70$ was worth, far more. That person agreed so they set up my Uber for me, day of the flight, we left 1and a half hours late because the pilots overslept ( they told us) I couldn’t get the person I knew on the phone to reschedule the Uber. Delta still took no blame, and they still wouldn’t help me get home. I had to call back the same person after I landed and go through that all over again, that person was my ex wife, sloppy divorce, she cheated, they’re married now. $69.10 ruined me and delta still won’t acknowledge fault. I asked them to waive my $71 baggage fee I had to pay to offset the mistake, nope, too bad. DO NOT FLY WITH THIS COMPANY. Oh the best part, I left a a few very descriptive complaints, they answered with oh, your talking about your baggage fee ( two different numbers btw $69.10 and $71 and some change) that’s all that is, you have to pay that we aren’t responsible for that, Ended my complaint on that. The baggage fee ($71) I paid when I changed my flight wasn’t charged until 3 days after I complained about the $69.10 already happening, but hey, it’s my fault right. Thank you delta for accessing my funds without my permission then blaming me for it, rudely and several times. Tried 0 stars, wouldn’t let me."
Date of travel: December 2020,20,"Delta Vacations hotel booking not so great, buy elsewhere","We ordered an all inclusive hotel through Delta, plus a roundtrip transportation to and from airport. The price was higher than on other booking websites but I wanted to use my points. Besides Delta claimed to include additional Exclusive All-Inclusive Plus perks, such as a free bottle of liquor,  and upgraded in-room amenities (soaps, lotions, bathrobes, slippers). The transport from the airport was fine, and they took our return flight information to arrange for the pickup. We were overall happy with the hotel. However on the day of the pickup to the airport they forgot about us, because ""our flight info was not in their system""... So we had to scramble to find a taxi.Also we did not get any of the promised special ""exclusive"" amenities. Hotel staff said those were at an extra cost, and the Delta rep who reached out to make sure things were fine had no idea about them either."
Date of travel: January 2021,50,ONE OF THE BEST AIRLINES IN THE WORLD!,"I have been flying for over 50 years. For the past 10 years, I have seen Delta improve its customer experience consistently to a point that it is my favorite airline now. Texting customer service is incredibly efficient and their agents provide the best customer service of any airline in the US and possibly the world."
Date of travel: November 2020,50,Ignore the negative reviews!,"I had to come up here and leave a review for Delta! First and foremost my flight has made me discover what I really want to do in life & thats travel..after COVID of course! They SANITIZE THE PLANE, free carry on bag with seat selection, still offer you snacks during COVID and most importantly they leave the middle seat empty! Nice smooth flight offer you headsets with movies and the pilot gets you there on time! What more can you ask for? If you want to be catered to pick a better spouse but if you want to get to where you're going pick Delta! I will never choose cheap again!"
Date of travel: December 2020,10,"Overpriced, little value, rude staff playing Dr","Overpriced, little value, rude staff playing Dr.   Never will I pay this company another dime to cram me into their no leg room planes with rude staff that are committing felonies by practicing medicine they are not licensed to do."
Date of travel: December 2020,50,Great job safety for customers,My son flew Delta to visit for Christmas all flights he had no one sitting next to himVery pleased with Delta
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Needs better training of their people,"Choices getting fewer and fewer.  American customer service sucks, and Delta no longer allows passengers to have private conversations that aren't politically correct.  Augggh.  Southwest is quickly becoming the only choice."
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Never again,"I hate bad service! Where do I start! I booked a business flight and ended up missing my connecting flight because I didn't get off the plane until 8 and my connector was on the complete opposite side of the airport leaving out at 805...therefore missing my business appointments. Total waste of my time and then the customer service rep was rude. This whole airline is ghetto, I had to fly to another city to claim my bag because it had weapons in it only to go right back home! Please don't waste your time or hard earned money flying with delta their attendants are ghetto and unprofessional!"
Date of travel: January 2021,10,I would never recommend Delta.,"The worst flight and service I have ever experienced. Do not count on them to go by their policy, they don’t care what their policy says just whatever gets them the most money from you."
Date of travel: December 2020,50,Great Customer service,"Great customer service , staff very friendly and helpful answered all my questions without hesitation and where happy to help! I will definitely be flying with Delta again!"
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Don’t fly Deta!,"Do not use DeltaDo not use Delta, they are scammers! They cancelled my flight 20 minutes before showing up and claimed it was due to me missing a connecting flight 5 days prior, yet my itinerary still showed as valid on their website. They said it was due to a “glitch” and that there was nothing they could do. They do not email you your boarding pass and there are several issues regarding booking on your website. DO NOT BOOK DELTA, i’m telling everyone I know!"
Date of travel: January 2021,40,Finally a good trip with delta,"THe on ground staff  ( Issuing boarding tickets ) was terrible , machines are not working , you have to go for a long queue then the employee at the counter took her 20 mins to finish our tickets . Flight was ok , leg space ok , storage space ok , entertainment ok. The snack meal is a joke"
Date of travel: December 2020,30,OK Flight,"It was an easy flight , Just one comment. They need to change their mea;/snacks its terrible.Flight attendants were ok , entertainment menu is not that good but a for a short flight it can pass"
Date of travel: December 2020,30,Bad Experience,"It was a quick flight , ground staff was ok . Flight , was on time , but they couldn't provide us with headphones , they said that they had any on that plane which is weird thing , I couldn't watch nothing during the whole flight , no blankets either. it was a terrible flight for me"
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Smooth flight back after a long weekend,I had an early flight on a Tuesday morning after a long weekend trip. Delta was the cheapest option returning to Boston from Austin and the experience was smooth and easy. The seats were comfortable enough to sleep for most of the flight and the boarding process was as painless as I could hope for. Only complaint is I would like to have chosen my seat ahead of time.
Date of travel: January 2021,10,What a terrible trip.,"4 flights in 4 days. All delayed. Your middle seat policy appears to only be valid when it suits Delta. On the next half empty flight you still managed to assign me a seat that was already occupied.  Now we can't find a flight attendant in Atlanta of all places. How far Delta has fallen. Moved from Atlanta to Washington two years ago. Amazing service from Alaska. We are talking Tampa to Jackson, not cross country. 👎👎👎👎"
Date of travel: January 2021,20,Bad experience,"Food served during international flight contained a rubber glove in the meal under the chicken. Flight attendant attitude was only that she didn't do it.New luggage was literally destroyed. Luckily only one small item was missing.Despite allegedly concerned about covid-19, masks and social distancing not enforced on this flight."
Date of travel: January 2021,40,"Delta is my airline of choice ""BUT""","We paid for first class from Atlanta to Palm Beach but because our flight from Amsterdam was late ""and"" we had to go through an extremely slow process through Customs (for nothing) we missed our connection.  The Delta rep who helped us find another flight was very nice and very helpful although he had to put us in Economy.  Probably won't get money back for not having First Class.  The flight to PBI was on time and they tossed us a plastic bag with water and energy bar.....nice of them.  I travel a lot and understand it will not always be perfect but I would say Avoid Atlanta if at all possible.  The new international terminal was a mess getting through and even if my flight from Europe had been on time I would not have made my connection."
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Ms,Once again- delayed!!! I really don't think Ive ever not been delayed on Delta. F'ed up my whole weekend. Thanks again Delta 👎👎👎
Date of travel: January 2021,10,"Need app for digital ticket, highly annoying to DL app for one use","The simple fact they make you download an app to get the ticket on your phone is over the top stupid. I travel a lot on different airlines. This is the only time I have had to download an app to get my ticket. If every airline was this dumb I would have to have 12 apps on my phone. If you don't travel a lot you have to download an app you use once then get rid of. No wonder you guys are always on the brink of bankruptcy, efficiency, I assume is not in their vocabulary."
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Delta Airlines service...you must be kidding,"Couldn’t get a cup of coffee, cocktail or soda in First Class all in the name of passenger safety.   Who are you kidding Delta. My next travel will not be with Delta. I’ll give them this much the cabin was clean👎"
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Delta falsely advertises that you can safely cancel/change your ticket before March 2021,"Delta advertised that one can safely cancel/change tickets and receive an e-credit for the ticket value if this is done before March 2021. i had 3 tickets booked for my family. after I canceled them, Delta only issued a partial refund for my ticket only and did not issue a credit for tickets of my husband and my daughter. I lost $2300 and Delta is nowhere to be contacted.  I called them multiple times, they never called me back and dropped calls each time I was holding for them.  Terrible service and pure lies in luring customers into booking flights."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,"Unreasonable changes in flights, non-refundable tickets, and unable to contact customer service","My first scheduled trip with Delta was scheduled for July. After booking my flight, Delta changed my flight so I would have arrived hours later than planned. Needless to say this was not compatible with my planned trip and my carpool. I cancelled with Delta, and they refused to refund my money. Instead I got flight credit for a later date (which expires if not used).I recently tried to use this flight credit for another trip planned for January. Since booking Delta has changed my flight three more times. My updated itinerary takes me through four different cities to get from Las Vegas to Kansas City...making me a whole day late from my expected arrival time. Nothing about working with Delta has been reasonable or acceptable. Their online 'self-service' will not allow me to reschedule the flight: even though their website shows available flights between Las Vegas and Kansas City still for sale. I'm currently on hold with their customer service number, going on 3 hours with nothing to show for it. Save yourself some time, money, and frustration. Do not book with Delta."
Date of travel: January 2021,50,lost bag,"When I arrived at my destination I was informed that my bag hadn't made it to the plane, but delta had the bag delivered right to my door in less than 24 hours and we're friendly and efficient. I was relieved that they new exactly where the bag was when I inquired and that they were even able to deliver to the military base where I live."
Date of travel: December 2020,20,Was that first class airline or low cost bus service?,"I didn't think it was possible to make flying less enjoyable,  but the airlines have found a way to achieve this.  Let me start with positive.  Because all airlines are basically being forced to drop exorbitant fees to entice clients,  I was able to make a change to a flight with no hassle.  Almost felt like the good old days of travel when the airlines didn't act like used car salesman.  The bad...We have never been treated so much like a disease as we were during our trip this December.  The flight attendants all the way to the captain of the plane made us feel like it was our privilege for them to fly us.  As the one paying their salaries and in this case around $5,000 for our tickets,  it should be the other way around.  I know everyone is scared to death right now, but if the planes and filtering systems are as safe as you say they are,  please stop stuffing the idea that masks will help down our throats.  We wore our masks, we boarded in the order requested,  we cleaned our chairs prior to sitting down.  Then we received a zip lock baggie with water and goldfish in out first class seats. We were then told to take our masks off to take a bite or sip, then put them back on in between.  Seriously?   I also would have been satisfied with a soda but apparently its only safe to serve alcoholic drinks because that is all they serve.  Just a heads up to all of you health Consultants at Delta,  I've known more people that have died from alcoholism in my life than Covid 19.  I don't have a problem with adults' consuming the beverage of their choice.  Just don't try to tell me you care about my health, then  contradict yourselves.  Also,  please ask your flight attendants to act like they care.  There are obviously some great ones,  but the percentages are going down.  Most seem to act on the defensive now.  PLEASE,  work on making it a pleasure to fly again.  I and all my employees have to fly in order to conduct business.  I don't want to feel like I am in the center seat of a low cost airline every time I fly."
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Not good,A bad experience with poor communication through out.  3 hour delay with no updates other than continuing to delay without giving a simple reason (turns out it was an air traffic control issue) but staff wasn’t capable of letting passengers know
Date of travel: January 2021,10,So Disappointed,I have always thought y’all had the best customer service and paid more to fly y’all instead of others. Not only has my flight been delayed 4 times and still not even on it. I was supposed to leave at 1655 today. I am still in Tampa and don’t even know if I will have a connecting flight from Atlanta to Memphis. Y’all have not been helpful. Your staff has argued that I didn’t pay for a first class ticket when I give them my confirmation number and show pic of ticket. I don’t know what else I can show. The woman that changed my ticket said to call y’all for a refund and y’all won’t give me one and everyone has been so incredibly rude. Y’all are saying you can’t refund me and I can’t sit in first class and I have been delayed four or five times. I am DONE with Delta. I understand delays out of your control but I do not understand the horrible service I have received today!!!!
Date of travel: December 2020,50,Excellent experience,"I will always recommend delta! The app was an added bonus, making it easy to check in, upgrade, add bags and find gates. I had a 30 minute layover in Detroit, which made me nervous. They had been closing boarding early to have time to deice the plane. I was able to use the app and see exactly where I was headed and board just in time. Their safety measures are great as well. Cannot say enough good things about this experience."
Date of travel: January 2021,10,Horrible treatment of military families,My 8 year old son flew out today we see him once a year due to being active duty military. Never have they only let only one parent back but today they would only let one of us back. Other airlines would give military a gate pass but not delta . Will never fly with them again .
Date of travel: January 2021,10,"$1,200 won't buy you a drink.","I normally fly American Airlines, but thought I would try Delta this time. Big mistake. Price on the first class ticket are about the same, around $1,200 round trip. The amenities is where you are going to see the major difference. The food and drinks they advertise on the Delta first class promotion is not what you receive. They use the bulls**t reason of Covid 19 as to why they don't serve liquor or provide any kind of an edible entree. Show me the medical proof of it being safer by serving beer or wine in place of liquor. Same thing only cheeper, that is the difference. The food served some generic biscuit and gold fish crackers. Whow don't give it all out at one time! You'll spoil them. Well, on a good note they didn't crash the plane, so I will give them that. Damn expensive goldfish crackers though."
Date of travel: December 2020,50,Evans Best Flight,"I would like to say that this is the best airline I've ever flown! The service was awesome and when I made a simple error, they corrected it without any problem. I was truly impressed with professionalism. Delta is no. 1. Thanks Delta"
Date of travel: December 2020,50,Great customer service,Delta knows how to take care of its customers. The fact that Delta blocks the middle seats due to covid-19 for the safety of travelers is a great asset.
Date of travel: December 2020,50,"Covid safety procedures are excellent, crew attentive and welcoming","Night flight on 29 December on DL 1 on a Boeing 767 in Delta one. Delta has their Covid 19 safety procedures while flying down pat and we felt safe.  The plane was immaculately clean, hand sanitiser and wipes were handed out on boarding, announcements were made concerning safety procedures such as the wearing of face coverings, not queueing for the toilets and so forth.  Note that they also said that if a passenger had to be reminded to put their mask on for a third time they would be banned from flying Delta.   The Delta one cabin only had 5 passengers out of around 34 seats and the main cabin was not very busy either.  We were all thanked profusely for flying with Delta.  Food and drink was good, choice of 3 main courses that could be selected before boarding or on the plane.  Meal was served on 1 tray to reduce contact but dessert, ice cream, was served separately.  I appreciated the fact that breakfast was served about 50 minutes before landing giving you as much time as possible to sleep.  I suppose if the cabin had had more passengers breakfast would have had to been served earlier.  We arrived in London Heathrow about half an hour early.  We fly Delta transAtlantic fairly regularly and invariably around the USA domestically and it remains my favourite US airline."
Date of travel: December 2020,50,What a Change,Where to start first of all the plane was very clean and comfortable. Staff were helpful through the the entire process from getting my tickets which was a reimbursement due to COVID-19. I had my three kids with me and it was a very smooth process. Infotainment system on the planes were amazing kids loved them and didn’t use there own equipment. Pilots and stewards were amazing and courteous. I had a very stress free experience throughout the trip. I haven’t flown in awhile when I first did with delta it was very “bare bones”. Now it is amazing best service at a great price keep up the great work!
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Nightmare Airline Ruined Multiple Trips,"This is the last time Delta ruins a trip.  Unfortunately I had booked two trips at the same time, so even though I vowed never to fly Delta again after the nightmare of the first flight I find myself again in the same situation.  Both times my flight was rebooked repeatedly.I was scheduled to fly from Sacramento to Ft. Lauderdale 12/22.  The flight was rescheduled 3 times which caused me to miss my family who was to pick me up and drive me across the state to Naples.  I arrived instead on 12/24 at 5:30 p.m.  The cost to me to get to Naples from Fort Lauderdale was well over $300 out of pocket because Delta is unable to honor the tickets it sells.  I will never fly this airline again.  The last time they arrived at ATL, sat on the tarmac for a good 20 minutes before going to the gate, left me and a pregnant woman with a child to run 2 terminals over before we could catch a 'people mover' to get the remaining 3 terminals to catch our connecting flight to FLL.  We arrived right after they cut off boarding and were not allowed to board.  Had to wait hours for the next flight.  I hate this airline with every fiber of my being.  Soul Plane would be a better choice than Delta."
Date of travel: November 2020,50,Delta is ready when you are - like right now!,"The planes are extremely clean, and there are no passengers seated in any middle row seats! High awareness of COVID protocol both in the Terminal and on the plane. Staggered seating with social distancing. Pre-Sealed bags of water and snacks vs the normal open cart beverage and snack service.  I felt very safe!Mask up and travel safe. VictorB"
Date of travel: December 2020,50,RUNA PRUYN,What a very professional woman . This lady helped my kids fly round trip as minor children she was the woman to help with them. Getting on and off the plane. As we arrived for the kids to board there was a storm and she was on top of her work letting us know about delays and the process. To all the flight attendants whom helped my children. They were in great hands. And a special thanks to Rona PRUYN. I wish all flight attendants were like her very friendly but In such a professional manner.
Date of travel: December 2020,40,Delta....,"The terminal  very clean  [Sea/tac], Delta employees very helpfully,  and Professional, no problems, at all, the aircraft, very clean,  and the crew very  nice,  Go Delta."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,"Customer Care Agent, Jason","Delta Customer Care Agent, Jason was very unprofessional. He continued to speak over me and then accused me of speaking over him. I remained quiet for a full 30 seconds and he said, ""Hello, are you there?"" I thought he had something to say?! I stated, ""You said I was speaking over you. I am not talking. Speak."" Jason did not relay any new information or advice. He continued to repeat the same information he stated in the beginning of the call. I advised him that he said the same thing three times and that I hoped someone was listening. He then said that he would transfer me to someone else sincecI didn't want to speak with him (I never said that).  He transferred me to American Express. I am appalled that Delta would allow someone to treat a customer that way. He stated that he was a supervisor and the only way to go above him was to email. I filed a complaint with Delta.com, but from how confident he sounded, I guess nothing will be done. This is just another way that I hope my frustration will be heard and maybe someone with authority will respond."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Rude rude and no ticket. ,Had a return flight booked with my new puppy. Had arranged a ticket for him in advance. Counter agent said he’s too young. Even though I had the vet paperwork saying he was ten weeks six days old. She lectured me about flying with such a young dog. I explained I just got him from the breeder and we were going home.  Take him back. See you at 12 weeks. That’s our rules. Ahhh. It’s not.  Ten weeks.  And I had that in a text from delta.  She didn’t care.  Had to rebook on another airline that actually follows the rules.
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Disregard for Helpless Customers,"Delta Airlines doesn’t have the slightest regard for customers under trying circumstances. As a desperate traveler who tried to get to Minneapolis from Madison through a snowstorm, after totaling my car on the highway I quickly booked a flight from La Crosse, WI to Minneapolis. Because of terrible driving conditions, my 70 year old dad had to be extra cautious and drive me slowly to the La Crosse Regional Airport. My flight was at 5:57 pm and I arrived at the airport at 5:30, thinking I would have plenty of time to get my tickets from the kiosk and walk to the gate. When I entered the airport, nobody was there to assist me at the Delta check in, so I tried the Delta Kiosk. I quickly and correctly typed in my information and at the very end when I pressed the button to print tickets, all I got was an “OOPS” and tickets didn't come out. There was still nobody in sight and as I tried the other Kiosk, it said “Too late to check in for this flight”. At this point it was still 20 mins before departure. Finally a TSA agent came down to assist me and asked if I’m on the flight that recently boarded. I said yes and followed her up to TSA security, where there was absolutely no one in line and no travelers in sight (it is a very small airport). It would have taken 3 minutes maximum to get me through TSA and board the flight, but instead the woman at the entrance to the gate said there’s nothing we can do. There is absolutely no reason that I wouldn’t have been able to get on that flight without causing any delays. It seemed like the workers wanted to quit early because it was the last flight; a true demonstration of their indifference to my situation. Whatever policies are in place that keep a traveler from boarding a plane even while the plane has to sit there for another 20 minutes is enraging. The TSA lady said “there’s a lot of work they need to do”, but I know that’s a bunch of bullcrap. The only work needed to be done was to check my 1 carry on in an empty line, and look up my ticket number. After basically being told to f-off and try again tomorrow, I called the number on the red delta card and was put on hold for 2.5 hours. This service was disgusting and I will not be buying from delta again."
Date of travel: December 2020,40,Since Covid.  Safe Clean.  Lacking in Service.,Its different flying with covid.  they do not book the seat next to you.  you must wear a mask the entire time.   the service is VERY limited.  you can smell the recirculated clean air as it filters.  it just different.  Movies are still good.   have fun
Date of travel: March 2020,40,incredible experience,"I really enjoyed my flight with Delta. The flight was delayed, and I would receive a message on my phone about it and when the boarding will actually start. It was easy to navigate through their options on the websites, and the travel itself was amazing. The food was correct, but what do you expect from an airline's food? Not much., right, =).All in all, if you have the option to travel with a company, Delta is great."
Date of travel: December 2020,20,Service could be better.,"I don’t fly alone often so naturally I had a question about my seating since my last flight had me reserve my seat at the desk when called. Unfortunately in ATL I had Elaine at the counter and asked about my seat since the Delta app was not loading my seat number and she did not want to deal with it and told me to read what it says on the TV. The system eventually loaded a seat for me last minute so the problem was solved, but it was more the attitude that really had me make a review in the first place. The rest of the staff was kind despite it being a holiday. I tried my best to understand that maybe she was in a bad mood due to her working on a holiday, but there were others that were also complaining about the lack of help and disrespectful attitude."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Delays,"Had my 12 o’clock flight changed to 7 pm, and instead of rescheduling the time it was classified as ‘delayed’ to that time - meaning there’s an off chance it leaves earlier and I would have to arrive and sit for 7 hours just in case. Of course it didn’t leave prior to 7 - and then we were told the delay was due to a missing staff member and the staff member we were waiting on was currently in Vegas and couldn’t get a flight to be back until 7. Literally sat in the airport for 8.5 hours - on Christmas Eve - for absolutely no reason because they couldn’t have a back up plan in place or simply have the courtesy to reschedule for a firm new time."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Flight cancellation last minute and terrible customer service,"Healthcare worker trying to get from DTW to DFW. Sudden flight cancellation and complete lack of attempt to assist or rebook. Thankfully Southwest Airlines is still a great airline, and they were able to help. The next time I fly it will NOT be on Delta if I have ANY other choice for airline career."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Delta is cancelling flights and itenerarys without any notice to customer.,We have had reservations for our flight to Mexico for months and have now been either changed or cancelled without any adjustments. Just an email saying Sorry your trip has been cancelled. Our friends showed up at Delta last Friday only to be told instead of getting to Mexico that day as planned you are now spending the night in LA. They promptly walked over to United and booked a flight and got to their place without issue. I spoke to a representative about the issue and I was told they are changing/cancelling flights without any notice. We will be using other airlines going forward.
Date of travel: December 2020,20,Incompetent Staff,"My sons flew unaccompanied minor this week and both they and I were extremely unsatisfied with the service we received. In past flights on Delta, a flight attendant would walk my sons down the gate and I generally expected to wait 15-20 minutes after the flight landed to receive my sons. This week, despite several flight attendants sitting by on their phones, the flight attendant assigned to my sons claimed that no one was available to walk them down the gate. For clarification, I was sitting 35 feet away and despite this fact the flight staff was unwilling to cooperate. My sons waited nearly an hour standing at the terminal while I was forced to purchase a pass, go through security, and walk down the gate. I would be fine with this if it had not been so last minute and because of the fact that this has never happened before on my son’s several flights with Delta. While I do understand how busy the flight attendants are due to the holidays, I do not appreciate the flight attendants unwillingness to cooperate with me. I will not be returning on Delta Flights and I am extremely unsatisfied with the treatment we have received"
Date of travel: April 2020,40,Standard Flight from Miami to Boston,Standard flight returning from Miami.  Delta is a pretty good airline and is consistently clean and organized
Date of travel: December 2020,20,COVID Procedures do NOT follow CDC Guidelines,"I have flown a number of times during this pandemic, but have never experienced such lack of consideration for customer health and safety. Boarding procedures are completely acceptable, boarding from the back of the plane to the front, to avoid face to face encounters. But what shocked me was when I arrived to my seat, I was forced to seat directly next to someone, in an aisle seat no less, with another customer to my right. A covid sandwich! The plane was completely full with zero flexibility to give an alternative seating arrangement. I am not the only customer who shared this same sentiment."
Date of travel: December 2020,20,Stressful travel day,"I was traveling home for the holidays with my boyfriend. We booked our flights separately but made sure our seats were next to each other. We boarded the plane, received wipes from the flight attendant, and wiped down our seats. The flight was supposed to leave at 7 a.m. At 7:15, the pilot announced over the loudspeaker that the plane had a malfunction and needed to be surveyed by a mechanic to make sure the plane was in working order. While I’m happy Delta wouldn’t send a faulty airplane into the sky, this ordeal took much longer than it should have, considering they already had us boarded onto the plane. At 8 a.m., the pilot announced the mechanic had arrived. We didn’t leave the ground until 8:30, an hour and a half later. My boyfriend and I were supposed to have a lengthy layover in Atlanta before our next flight to our final destination. However, after the delay, we missed the layover flight before the plane even left the ground. The Delta app automatically rescheduled our flights, but they booked my boyfriend and I on separate flights, so we had to scramble to try to sort it out so we could still travel together. The new itinerary had us stopping at another airport before our final destination, but we were desperate to get home and opted to accept it. We had lots of time in Atlanta to eat and go to the bathroom, and we boarded the next plane. Sure enough, a few minutes passed and the pilot announced he couldn’t leave because there was a lightbulb out in the cabin. I couldn’t believe that two separate Delta flights had maintenance issues after boarding the passengers. We’ve flown with Delta numerous times previously and have never run into this issue, so it was most likely a fluke. However, it just seemed crazy to us that they would board the passengers before checking to make sure the plane was in working order. I’m not sure if this practice is standard for airlines or not, but I’ve never experienced it before. Because of the second delay, we had to rush to get to the next gate and barely had time to make the next flight. Thankfully we didn’t have to reschedule anything else, but it was truly an awful travel experience, especially since we were exhausted from waking up so early."
n/a,50,Seamless experience with excellent service,"Delta continues to out fly their competition when it comes to serving the customer, on time departures, baggage handling, and aircraft cleanliness. During this pandemic (or any other time), there's not a better airline to fly either domestic or international. They really go above and beyond to be the difference."
Date of travel: December 2020,20,"Great Flights, LONG hold times","A number of my hours of life were wasted sitting on hold with Delta to get a problem resolved... twice. Upon the ending of my first phone call, I was under the impression my flight issue was solved, come to find out a few weeks later that my reschedule was for the wrong day and I had to fly out two days before. Obviously I didn't because I thought the problem was solved. On my last call, my new flight was actually scheduled for the correct day and I did not pay more for my new ticket. My biggest problem with Delta was waiting on the phone for HOURS."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,AVOID DELTA AIRLINES!,"I am leaving in the morning for Seattle, flew in on Alaska, and have to fly back on Delta. Their website is  nightmare to use. It keeps you going around in circles, back to the same place to start all over again, I paid almost $30.00 for what I thought was an 'upgrade'. It is NOT an upgrade at all. It is only so you can choose your seat instead of getting assigned!!! Then, it tricked me into paying for insurance twice, and I believe I also paid twice for luggage!!! When I finally found a phone number to call, I had to wait for a call back. The agent could NOT find the information I was looking for AND he said I would have to settle the $$ dispute with the insurance agency, when they were the ones who messed up!!!! I am thinking of doing a class action lawsuit over their website and service. If anyone is interested please put 'DELTA' in the subject line and mail it to horst.jana@gmail.com. Thank you. I can see other people have scored this airline low as well. I have never had such crappy service in a LONG time. The last one was American Airlines....another nightmare."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Moving to island and made us leave 2 small dogs behind.,"After checking with delta 2 times the week before departure to make sure we could bring our 4 little dogs (7lbs) with us because we were moving to island,, there were 3 adult passengers with all proper documentation, health cert. etc, delta emotional support animal docs. ($1800+) the morning of our flight we were told we absolutely could only bring 2 dogs. These dogs are our family we had to leave behind and they wouldn’t let us buy an extra seat even though seats were available. My dogs were quiet the entire time, never bothered anyone as they are 13 years old. Luckily my son was able to take the two temporarily but I’m devastated over an airline whom advertised PET FRIENDLY which is why I chose them. Never again if I can hep it."
Date of travel: December 2020,50,Best airline by far,"I have always been extremely impressed with this airline. I just got back from Mexico meaning I was flying during the pandemic. Delta made me feel so safe with their reduced capacity (I had rows all around me open), and upgraded filtration system. Those are just some examples of what they have changed to make flying viable during a pandemic. People from my work and some friends have also traveled during this pandemic and have flown with other airlines. They all mentioned how the flight was packed. It just shows how delta truly cares."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Holy crap!,"First time flying post COVID from LA to Florida and it was fine, that’s why I am giving the score of 3. However on the return Delta flight DL1692 was disgusting. Both in service & cleanliness. Never seen a plane in the US like this (see pictures) and when brought to their attention, rather showing interest to resolving the issue, both attendants were angry that my nose was exposed. Hello! Have you read the news? Delta is going through another round of layoffs, and if your not happy to have a job, let someone that appreciates working, work!Delta sky lounge in Atlanta, terminal A, celebrating 35yr anniversary. Congratulations! Why are the staff so unhappy? Literally there were 2 guys that were pleasant but the rest were not happy to have a job.

Date of travel: December 2020,10,Scheduling messed up!,"Scheduling messed up my flights. My itinerary said my connecting flight departed at 4:00 pm but it really departed at 2:00 pm and I landed at 2:27. Forcing me to have to go catch another flight to Minneapolis MN before I can go to Marquette MI. So, instead of getting home at 5:30 pm I got home at 10:24 pm waisting a day of leave. Anyone else who is military understands the disappointment of waisting an entire day of leave on travel instead of with family that you haven’t seen in over a year."

Date of travel: December 2020,10,Do not fly with delta!,If you have any other choice do not fly with delta. They lack the necessary equipment to deice their own planes my flight was delayed 6 hours because they did not have B enough machines. Please don’t fly with delta I bet you all.
Date of travel: December 2020,40,Unaccompanied minor,I booked an unaccompanied minor ticket back when covid first started. So well over 6 months ago. The flight got changed to a later departure time which put arrival time into JAX pretty late. I didnt receive any emails but thankfully a man at the ABQ airport saw the mistake and contacted me the night before.  Delta switched my child's ticket to a closer airport for the person picking her up at NO CHARGE. So less travel time for my child and less drive time. The man I spoke with in reservation changes was VERY KIND AND PROMPT!! I have read bad reviews on them but my experience was GREAT and I will continue to give Delta my business. THANK YOU DELTA
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Damaged/Stole all my valuables,"I have never flown before and not sure if I want to again after this flight. The flight itself was fine but the company is a cheap a.. that doesn't care about anyone or their property. I was on a work trip with all my electronics needed, I told the check in clerk that took my bag that I had valuables inside so that they would know to handle with care, but they did not. Flight to my destination was fine but coming home I received my luggage plastic wrapped together. The Delta employee actually asked me if I wrapped it myself like that before checking it in lol REALLY!? All my electronics were damaged and broken, $450 cash was stolen, and so was my prescriptions. It looks like my luggage was gone through, taken what they wanted, then put my bag under the vehicle and ran it over. The metal and wood in my suitcase completely destroyed. I have pictures of everything which I sent to Delta for my claim. They damaged over 3k worth of my personal property. Even though I followed their policy by letting check in know about the electronics they would not cover them. They reimbursed me $300 and gave me $350 in ELECTRONIC funds to fly their airline again LMFAO wow I would never get on Delta again with more then just a carry on so I can keep my luggage with me since they will not take responsibility for anything their company does wrong. The supervisor Carla Johnson didn't give 2 sh... about my stuff nor did she ever apologize for the wrong her company did. All she did was keep reminding me that Delta is not responsible for electronics if put in luggage. What a joke. They have the ability to reimburse a passenger for lost or damaged items of $3500 and they go above and beyond to NOT give any of that out. I recommend if you fly Delta, only take a carry on, if you have more stuff to take, look into a different airline. Worst experience of my life dealing with the customer service at this company."
Date of travel: December 2020,50,Best overall airline,"I have had the pleasure to fly with some of the best airlines and I must say Delta is number one. This was my first time flying with Delta.  Their seats are more comfortable and modern looking than other airlines. Our flight was only 1.5 hours and we received a nice snack along with earphones to watch movies on your personal screen. I appreciated being able to watch the safety instructions on screen as oppose to looking at the flight attendants while they demonstrate what to do in case of an emergency. The flight attendants were very friendly and polite however it was very difficult to understand the announcer due to the language barrier. She was kind to let us know English was not her first language. Last but not least to be able to text my family midair was was great! Although I flew economy the service an amenities it felt like first class!! You never get a chance to make a first impression and Delta has left a great impression on me!! Thank you for a friendly, comfortable, and smooth flight 😊!"
Date of travel: December 2020,10,First Class service is DESPICABLE!,"I understand the various airlines cutting food and beverage service while they got their footing and adjusted to COVID, but eight months later and Delta still not offering anything more than an inexpensive “snack box” in First Class is nothing short of a RIP OFF!Delta may want to look at the way JetBlue does business.  Even during the height of COVID, JetBlue provided much better food service than Delta does currently!What is even more disgraceful is Delta has not slashed their prices for First Class travel.  Basically, the only thing First Class customers are getting over Coach is a seat that’s a little wider with slightly more recline.  Get your act together Delta!"
Date of travel: December 2020,30,Their policy encourages lying.,"I am a frequent flier with my dog. I am most often the only person on the plane who has paid the $125 one-way because I am not claiming that my dog is an emotional support animal. Now, please let me be frank here. There is a difference between someone who is obviously using a service animal due to a physical or emotional handicap....and then there is everyone else.  I know that Delta believes that they have made it difficult to take a pet for free, but that is NOT what people say who do this. I have asked them. They state that that documentation is easily found online, one just needs to pay for it, and that in the long run, it saves them money. So, I fly with my dog under the seat for $250 round trip and they fly with theirs on their lap for free! How is this fair? I ask, can my dog earn 1/2 miles? No. Can I get an extra piece of luggage free? No. Can I use my companion pass for him? No. Your policy encourages lying while offering nothing to those of us who are honest. Even just offering free wifi would be something, but Delta offers nothing for the few-and-far-between who are honest customers. Secondly, on a separate note, Delta should offer some type of reduced-luggage fees if one is flying to Africa with two extra suitcases of school supplies, as I am on Dec. 21. To pay $400 to deliver supplies to a struggling school seems like a decision that needs to be evaluated. Finally, as a soon-to-be Silver Medallion Member, your benefit of a free piece of luggage is not a benefit to those of us with Delta AmEx cards as we already have one piece free....you should allow SM members to have an additional free bag. In closing, the biggest issue is the one involving traveling with my dog. That one puts me in a slow burn me every time."
Date of travel: December 2020,50,I love Delta!  Best on time flight record of all airlines.  Courteous staff.  I HATE LaGuardia airport though!,"I had foot surgery so I asked for wheelchair service.  Thank goodness I did.  We had to go outside and across a heavily cracked sidewalk to meet a bus that drives in a circular route around the airport to even find the rental car shuttles.  I would never had been able to find it on my own.  My very knowledgeable guide had to ask several people.The return was just as bad.  The airport bus took me to a Delta counter.  A Delta counter most convenient for him, not the main terminal.  Again, asked for wheelchair service.  Had to depart the terminal I was in and go outside to catch a bus to the main terminal.  I would never had found it on my own.While everyone I encountered st the Delta counter and the wheelchair aides were professional and courteous, the bus drivers were surly and unhelpful.  The airport itself was in a state of complete disarray and poor maintenance.  They seemed to be rebuilding. They should have someone meeting every arrival to guide them around the mess if they're catching another flight.  Horrible experience."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Poor Treatment by Staff at Boarding Gate,"This flight, Delta 9348,  December 9th 2020, was a connection, I had travelled from Manchester UK.     The whole trip with two connections was booked with Delta.. The flight from Manchester was delayed by over 1 hour.  When we arrived at Amsterdam we had to rush to reach the gate. It was a long way across the airport. The screen showed us the gate was about to close. I ran as fast as I could with my daughter, I'm 63 years old and Diabetic. When we reached close to the gate a staff told us to hurry they're closing. We ran to the gate, when we arrived I felt dizzy and  faint.  I told my daughter and she called for assistance, she asked if they could give me a glass of water, two staff came over. I explained that I was Diabetic and the rush and anxiety likely caused my glucose level issues.  I took a glucose tablet and waited a few seconds.  They took us to the boarding area, checked in my daughter and told her to board. She waited, not wanting to go without me. The staff then took my passport and ticket and ordered me to go behind the counter to a separate area where they proceeded to search me and my luggage. I asked why I was being searched after having a Diabetic episode they responded that ""it's random"".  They took my medication out of my bag and questioned why I was travelling with so much medication.  I had already told them several times that I was Diabetic. I travel with testing equipment and medication.  I asked them if they realized they were causing extra stress which could worsen my condition. I was also concerned that we would miss the flight. One staff (the only male present) asked me why I was ""so angry"".We were eventually let on the flight but I'm not going to let my treatment by Delta representatives in Amsterdam go unnoticed.Why did they respond to someone who had a Diabetic episode by conducting a search of me and my luggage?"
Date of travel: December 2020,50,Will Only Fly Delta,"I have been flying with Delta for years and this is the only airline I will choose! I don’t always like dealing with customer service when I have issues (had to change some flights due to Covid) but the flight staff has always been wonderful. Plus, Delta has been very proactive during Covid. I always feel safe. I will continue to fly the skies with Delta!"
Date of travel: November 2020,50,Customer Service During Covid,"I have used several different airlines in traveling between the US and Brazil. Without doubt COVID has made for more complicated international traveling.I had to reschedule our trip to Brazil twice due to COVID. Then I had to make a change to the cities we were flying out of. Delta's customer service always answered the phone in a timely manner (within 10 minutes). They always were courteous, clear speaking, and! helpful.Delta may not be the cheapest option, but the customer service I have consistently experienced makes the premium worth it."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Flight was just fine but left my laptop onboard,"I'll start by saying that, when I travel, I fully expect the flight to be the worst part of the trip. However, Delta's flight was on-time, the seats were comfortable, and the attendants were friendly. All-in-all a good flight so I was pleased and I would definitely fly them again. Here's my issue. It took me a day to realize that my laptop wasn't in my backpack--I had left it in the seat pocket on my inbound flight (rookie move, I know). Fortunately, I was returning home the next day and went straight to the lost and found to check on it. Thank goodness it was still there. Apparently, they were just about to ship it to some central warehouse where it certainly would have been lost forever--like the boxed up Ark in the last scene of Raiders of the Lost Ark. Here's my beef...if they found it in the seat pocket, and they have a record that I was the passenger sitting there, and they have my contact information....why not reach out to me to tell me they found it??? I know I was lucky in this case, but it's only because my inbound/outbound flights were so close together...but I have to assume that a heads up would have been easy for them and they wouldn't have had to go through their processing steps."
Date of travel: March 2020,30,average experience - no better / worse,"Gate staff waited around but didn't allow people to come to speak with them until 6 minutes before boarding, so line was long.  Flight attendants weren't overly friendly, more direct and to the point. We traveled with children ages 10 and 11, and they noticed the service was less than par than other airlines like British Airways and Jet Blue. Snacks for purchase were limited and didn't have most of what was on the selection sheet.  On the trip back Flight #280 the flight crew were much nicer on that trip back."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Took My Money,"They took my money for 1St class, then when we were to be seated they told us 1st class was full.  Yes when we walked by it was, so we flew and asked around a bit. We were told to write Delta and request a refund for the difference. We did and called the money never came. Delta disappointed and took our money, I will not fly Delta and will never recommended it"
Date of travel: December 2020,40,Beware delta website bookings,"So I have been flying with delta for nearly 20 years, because of using them for previous business travel I had been using them for personal flights etc. because of the miles accrued. Recently learned of a very shady practice by Delta on their website when it happened to me, and based on posts here and other travel sites, it appears that they are targeting individual ticket prices of $1000 or more.Here’s how it works:You log in to the Delta site, (or in some cases just search for a flight to purchase without an account).You then find your flight and fill in all the details and enter your payment information and click to purchase the ticket.(Here’s where they get duplicitous)You wait for the payment to process and you get a screen that says “We are unable to accept card payments at this time.” Well, huh, what other kind of payments does their site accept? That’s right, NONE.You are then taken back to the beginning of the flight search like the whole process had failed. (It didn’t)Normally people would start over, but thankfully I had alerts turned on for my banking app and the moment delta took me back to search for my flight again and try another time to purchase a ticket, my phone buzzed and showed an alert that I had made a purchase with Delta internet in Atlanta... I thought, “ooh, I did get my ticket!” So I checked my upcoming trips and nothing, logged out and back in, nothing.So I called Delta and waited 3 hours to talk to some jack at call center who assured me that they had no reservation in my name, and then told me that I had no pending charges with delta.So I called my bank, sure enough delta had placed a hold on the amount for my plane ticket.So I called Delta again, then my bank again... After 8 hours all I learned was that Delta placed an INDEFINITE hold on my card for the ticket amount they didn’t give me and denied ever placing any charges on my card every time I called.After 2 days on google I have learned that I am not alone, and some people who don’t check their bank or card statements get multiple holds for pending transactions placed each time they try until finally getting the transaction to give them an actual ticket.Here’s the rub,• nobody in Delta customer service can even see those charges.• Delta will do this as many times as the person tries to buy a ticket, place charge holds for those amounts in duplicate, triplicate, and so on.• Delta targets individual ticket prices of over $1,000 USD for this scam, (perhaps because business travelers buying tickets with a company card aren’t checking the transaction history?)• often times if the customer doesn’t call their bank and delta several times immediately after the duplicate fraudulent pending hold charges are made, Delta will run those transactions and take the money if they think the customer didn’t notice.• Delta is completely denying that it ever happened each time, even with escalating to higher and higher level customer service representatives, they are telling you that no charge was placed on your card.Delta places an indefinite hold on the funds and waits to see if the customer notices before cashing in, and even then they sometimes run the charge through anyway, at which point you have to fight them for months spending days worth of hours on the phone.I was lucky, I noticed in time and have only been defrauded a single ticket price, my bank is blocking delta if they try to run the charge that is STILL on hold, but legally can only wait for delta to release the hold to give me my money back.Things to know:-Don’t buy tickets from Delta’s website.-If you do and you get the message that the transaction didn’t go through, check your card transactions immediately, if it was a pricey ticket, you’re probably screwed.-it is actually against the law for them to place a hold on charges without giving you a receipt for the intended goods or services, so Delta is definitely not being lawful, and committing fraud.Speaking with web/programmers it appears that it would be very difficult for a transaction to fail where the card was charged but the sale not made, so that means that this is most assuredly an intentional scam on the part of Delta Airlines targeting high priced tickets and placing an indefinite hold on the funds to wait and see if the customer noticed the duplicate or triplicate or MORE charges before running those charges through. Once run through, however, Delta will make you fight for months to be refunded. As far as money trapped as pending charge holds? I don’t know. I am yet to find someone who the hold was released. Usually they just run the charge through “accidentally” once you catch them placing a hold on “failed” transactions and then you have to bother them for a month or two for a refund.I will let you know what happens.Anyone in the NY area who this has happened to, it is not a series of innocent accidents, it is a targeted campaign of corporate fraud. If you’d like to compare notes for joining a possible class action suit already happening, post here."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Will NEVER FLY DELTA AGAIN,"Given incorrect information {lied too) in San Diego. Flight delayed, missed connection in Salt Lake (which also is an AWFUL airport). Could not get assistance from Delta. Had to BEG for help. They couldn't have cared less. Stuck in Salt Lake at 6:30p, nothing open neat airport. Trying to support travel during Covid, etc. At this point dont care if they go under and I do not support them getting govt assistance!!These issues were created by Delta and no one else!"
Date of travel: November 2020,50,Just a Great Experience,"I can't say enough good things about my family's experience with Delta.  Our days got moved for our vacation and they let us switch flights for no extra charge -- just the difference in the ticket price, which worked out great because we ended up with a credit for another flight later on -- and then during our flight, everyone was polite and COVID safe.  It was just a great experience.  I want to only use Delta when possible.  Love it."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,Terrible services,"They held us back from our flight, because of a problem with their own servers. Then asked us to pay extra. If you want to fly internationaly don't fly Delta."
Date of travel: December 2020,50,Thank you Delta and Crew!,"Thank you for taking extra steps during COVID!!  The airline spaced out and left open many seats to make sure that everyone was distanced.  They also handed out sanitizer wipes and pre-packaged food.  They loaded the plane from back to front to reduce contact between people, also the stewardesses only came up and down the aisle prior to take off, when asked and prior to landing."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Worst airline in America,"This is the worst airline in america, they have no respects for passages and I saw who they abuse a single mother with 3 kids because the kids masks were falling bellow the nose. This is a total abuse of power and an human rights."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,First class ticket but no entry in Sky Club,I bought an expensive first class ticket but was not allowed entry in the Sky Club because I'm not an American Express member. I get it that not all credit cards are accepted everywhere but to only have one option and no cash.
Date of travel: November 2020,40,that luggage fees,Gate staff was clear in giving out instructions boarding was in an orderly manner. Impressive cleanliness of the plane. Flight crew was good. Again your'e luggage fees is a killer.
Date of travel: November 2020,40,painful luggage fees,"Love the way the plane is being safe with their thorough cleaning, flight crew was professional no issues. Plane smells, looks and feels like brand new. Flight was smooth all the way to Cancun. Pls. do something with your'e ridiculous luggage fees. It's an International flight shelling out $85 for 2 checked in luggage is not a great way to start a vacation."
Date of travel: December 2020,10,This is literally the worst airline on the planet,I'll never fly with this group of incompetent uncaring fools again. They kept us on the tarmac for an hour in perfect weather because another flight was delayed and they didn't have ground crew to help. why didn't they have ground crew?  Because they could care less how long people are trapped inside their nightmarish planes
Date of travel: October 2020,40,Great service even with a 1 1/2 year old.,Traveled October 2019 When tickets were purchased included Lounge but Delta changed the rules Mexico First Class not allowed in the lounge but still great customer service even with a 1 year old.
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Will never fly Delta again,"Delta is appalling. They cancelled around 500 flights over Thanksgiving, including my flight to New Orleans TWICE. They did not rebook the 2nd time, just left me stranded one day before Thanksgiving. Their website did not allow refund for THEIR cancellation so I had to spend hours on hold for a PARTIAL refund, and it ruined my trip. They are crooks."
Date of travel: November 2020,20,"Good flights, but terrible customer service","Every time I’ve flown with delta, I’ve had a good experience. Unfortunately, every time I’ve had to make a change to flights, request a refund (during covid after additionally purchasing travel insurance), or try to submit documents for my service animal I have issues with their CS. First it was to cancel a flight due to covid. They wanted to make me reschedule it. Then it was that they didn’t want to refund me for 4 months before I threatened legal action (there was a whole lawsuit due to the fact delta was the only airline that refusing to refund people for covid restrictions), and today it was that no one knew of a way to submit the documents via email so that they had them. The supervisor I spoke with (Ginger) was helpful, but had backhanded and short responses to solve the issue. The site wouldn’t let me submit all four docs due to site error and everyone I spoke with before ginger was snarky with me, Stating that it was somehow my fault and I should resize my documents. The flight can be great, but if i don’t get good back end service I don’t recommend the service. Ginger did put in a note that I’m okay to fly with my dog, and suggested I still have my documents available for proof upon check in (this is for any airline), and I made sure I thanked her profusely."
Date of travel: November 2020,50,As expected,"Delta was an airline that I didn't fly because being from California, there just were not that many connections, unless I flew to their hub in Atlanta.  That was years ago, and a lot has changed, and I have flown Delta more often.  The flight rates vary widely, but I do like this carrier with their reliability and very professional service.  The only downside is that miles accrued are based on dollars spent and not actual miles, which is a bit deceiving (and discounts the miles), though the miles do not expire. In the COVID-19 era, I have been pleasantly surprised to find social distancing in seating."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Long dilate,Our flight DL1087 was supposed to leave at 10AM. It is 2pm and still the flight hasn't departed. All passengers are inside the plane already for more than an hour. This is very irresponsible considering that they must be more careful than ever during Covid. They should not keep passengers inside a plane knowing that there is a mechanical problem that could take long time to fix it. The plane already had a dilate in FT Lauderdale so probably they knew about the mechanical problem way before the plane arrived to NY. The most secure and responsible attitude would be to change us to another plane.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Flight from JFK airport to Atlanta,"Slight confusion with the check in counter Delta representative regarding taking hand bag on board v/s checking at the gate, as had an onward flight to Santiago from Atlanta, resulted in some unusual loss of time. That's the only reason why I have given 4 star rating as opposed to 5 star rating. Otherwise departure & arrival of flight in Atlanta and onboard customer service were satisfactory."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Delta flight from Atlanta to Santiago,"Friendly customer service at the check in counter and on board, timeliness of departure & arrival of the flight, clean & refurbished aircraft which was very comfortable, timeliness of luggage arrival & reasonable ticket cost are the reasons for my rating. Certainly would very highly recommend this air journey with Delta airlines to any traveler visiting Santiago in Chile."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Only Diamonds Matter...,The customer service rep I spoke to was incredibly rude and condescending. If she was my employee she would be terminated instantly. She spoke down to me when I didn't understand her policy on cancellation versus the one on the website. She then put me on hold twice without notice in the middle of me speaking. The Delta website is utter trash. The chat support wasn't working. Can't leave a complaint via your complaint submission page on this site. Just errors out both times I tried to submit one. Hell can't even leave a message via the Facebook Message option the mention here. It just redirects you to their support page on their site which is also broken. All you can do is call. Get with the times already. I have been loyal to Delta but it is very one-sided. I will be switching my loyalty elsewhere.
Date of travel: November 2020,20,Nightmare Travels,"Make sure to confirm each ticket!! Yesterday, on November 26th we got an email that Delta canceled our flight due to a shortage of staff. All was good, they transferred our flight to United. Today, 11/27/20 we arrive at the airport at 5 am and go to the terminal for United. We wait for an absurd amount of time only to be told that Delta did not transfer 2/4 tickets that they were supposed to. So we run to the terminal that has Delta to try and figure everything out, already missing our flight. All they say is that they made a small mistake, but since it was already 6 am and our flight leaves at 6:10 there is obviously no way that we can get on, and they can't transfer our flight to a later one. They tell us that they can book us 4 seats to fly to Cancun tomorrow, and say that we can get a full refund for our troubles. We call again, later today, to confirm our flight, only to find out that they canceled our tickets because we requested a full refund, and that they cannot do that. So we had to rebook our tickets, for the full price, while being held on hold for over an hour. Awful awful service, making a travel a nightmare. Funny how a company that prides itself on customer service, lacks it so much."
Date of travel: November 2020,50,Great Flight,Great flights....really appreciate the fact they leave middle seat open. Loved the TV's on the seat backs.First time flying this airline. Airline staff very helpful...plane very clean. I will fly with Delta again.
Date of travel: November 2020,10,They don't like pets,"I am writing this email to share the sad and frustrating experience I had with Delta.I was supposed to go on a flight on the 11/26/2020 thanksgiving eve to see my family in Israel.Flight number DL234 Departing JFK 26 Nov.When I travel I normally take my emotional support dog with me and we only flying delta.When I got to the check-in point in JFK the lady didn't ask me any questions about my dog and she was even happy to see her, I paid 100 USD extra for the extra 4 pounds I had and I continued with my journey to the airplane.When I got to my gate ( B41) a lady named Asha along with her supervisor( I can't remember the guy name ) plus he never even mentioned his name asked me for my dog's documents, and because we travel a lot I have everything ready Including the health form singed from my doctor, another singed documents from my dog's vet and all of the requested files from Delta plus all of the vaccines since the day she was born.When I provided Asha with the documents all she was saying is "" you need to do it via email, which is not true (not anymore) I am aware of the process and I sent delta the documents via email a few weeks before the flight but I got an email back from Auto-Reply Delta that saying Animal Related Requests - Action Required – Bring Documentation to Airport on Day of Departure ( attached).When I explain it to Asha and even wanted to share with her the email she said "" I am not asking!! I am saying!!! this is not true!""At this point, I realized that something is wrong and I am about to miss my flight.The supervisor that I can not recall his name ( no name tag) asked for the documents once again, I have provided him with all of the 15 documents I have after a couple of minutes without really looking or checking the files he got back to me claiming that I am missing the mental health and he got to cancel my flight, which he did a minute after without even letting me talk at same time Asah was saying this is it you are not our client anymore so you can leave or I call to security, security? what did I did wrong that you are calling the security all I wanted it to go back home for a couple of months with the emotional support dog that I got since I left the military.I asked the supervisor what I can do, even explained to him that I have nowhere to go and showed him the file that he needs, but he was just keeping saying that this is not the right file, I asked him how it's not the right file If I am doing it all the time and I have 0 issues traveling with my dog, then he answered "" you need to do it at the check-in point and that's your fault not telling them about your dog.I told the supervisor that this is not my job and if they didn't ask me questions about my dog how I can know that is a problem.I will just mention that they saw my dog at the check-in as they even petted her.I offered the supervisor to pay money for a ticket for my dog and of course, he ignored my request.At this point, they closed the doors on me and canceled my flight.I decided to stop talking with the front gate desk and get on the phone with delta customer service.The customer service lady really wanted to help and she even said that my dog is approved to go on the flight ( she probably saw that is not the first time).She asked to talk with the supervisor but unfortunately, the supervisor didn't want to talk with me or to her.I told the supervisor and Asah that I don't have where to go and I really need to go back to Israel, this is was my last day in my apartment in NYC, but they didn't really care all they did Is to get mad at me like I did something wrong.The supervisor and Asah didn't tell me where my suitcases are and I ended up leaving the airport without my suitcases (worth more than 10K).I am feeling disappointed by the company I placed my trust in for more than 10 years I am flying only delta and I can tell you one last thing I am not going to do it anymore."

Date of travel: November 2020,50,Top notch customer service DELTA EMPLOYEE,"It was unfortunate our flight had to get pushed back, so we decided to go to the sky mile club at MIA while we waited for our flight. As soon as we walked in , we were greeted warmly by Frank Aguerrebere. He was so kind and polite. We spoke to him about our flight being pushed back and he immediately offered to help us out, and was able to put us on a earlier flight. We were amazed by his customer service skills as he made our experience with delta exceptional. He went above and beyond! Thanks a lot Frank! We will definitely be back to visit soon next time we are in MIA."
n/a,10,Pre-check not added,"On November 24th I arrived at Midway airport,  and after checking in, I found out that I didn't have my pre-check added.  The day before I had called Delta  Airlines at Midway and the lady had said it was ok after providing my Global Entry number.  So I complained at the boarding gate.  The Delta response was: It was the fault of TSA, and it had probably to do with my last name being haphinated (!!!???). After that I called TSA in Midway, and the lady over the phone told me that I had failed to ask for the Airline to resubmit my reservation. Honestly, I had never heard of that resubmission before, and I have used my Global entry before many times.  At that moment, I was really upset.  What is the point of paying for Global entry then?  By the way, the  treatment by the TSA staff at the security gate was horrible (that lady with short dyed hair talked to me in a very b.... way!). Please,  avoid Delta and the  Midway airport if you can."
Date of travel: November 2020,50,Travel during COVID-19,"My trip with Delta was terrific! The staff were incredibly accomodating and friendly. They made my 13 hours flight very pleasant even during these very unpleasant times. At first I was scared to travel during covid, however, on my flight there was only 40 people on a 300 seat plane. I had about 15 rows to myself. (18+ I recommend the white wine they had to offer)"
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Service is just horrendous.,Upon leaving FLL to head to ATL i purchased seats which were then changed the day of the flight with no alert and was NOT able to get a refund. Then upon returning to FLL my bag was not onboard my flight and resulted in a delay after I was told to bring my bag onboard and then told to have it transferred. Very displeased with Delta’s service and will definitely be siding with Southwest.

Date of travel: November 2020,50,Covid Quality,A truly exceptional flying experience. EVEN with CoVID policies and procedures to follow. Completely opposite of my AA flight home.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great flight on Delta,"Traveled to Tampa during February school vacation week. The flight was on time both ways and the check-in process was seamless. Cabin was very clean and the flight crew was great. Very polite.  Overall, a great experience."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Holiday disabled person,Detroit MI left my mother disabled with no hotel help or guidance for the night because thebflight was delayed enough she couldn't move fast enough to the next flight. Prior 2 hour lay over. I will not fly through Detroit or with delta again.
Date of travel: November 2020,50,Great international flight!,Two weeks ago we went to St. Lucia for vacation. This was our  first flight since Covid hit. We were impressed with the service and especially not having three people to a row on the plane was wonderful. Thanks Delta !!  You made us feel so much better about flying. The plane was very clean. The snacks were not the best but what can you expect in this new age in which we are traveling. Great flight Delta!
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Horrified at NO Social Distancing in flight,"On my second flight from SLC to SNA, a 1 hour 45 minute flight on a smaller plane, there was NO attempt whatsoever to space folks apart. The plane was about 80 % full and we were literally breathing each other's air, rubbing elbows, wondering how many would get sick in the next couple of days. It did not help that they simply came by distributing bags with snack and water, which of course a goodly number of folks used, taking off masks and gnawing away for els of time. In this time of pandemic, Delta's wonton disregard of public safety may make sense from a dollar perspective, but make no mistake, I will be flying airlines that advertise and deliver safe practices, such as SouthWest. I am still horrified by the whole experience and will probably book a flight back home on another airline, incurring 100's of lost dollars. Delta should be very ashamed."
Date of travel: November 2020,50,Holiday Vacation during COVID,"I have just returned from an early Holiday break flying round trip Tampa - Minneapolis.

I needed to cancel 2 and went on the Delta reservation page and marked the 2 passengers to cancel.  Delta cancelled ALL 4 by mistake.  Delta tells me that I need to pay $380 per ticket more to re-book the same tickets even though they made the mistake.  The cancellation webpage allowed me to mark each individual passenger and did not at any time warn me that I was would be cancelling all 4 passengers.  This is a racket.  I asked to file a complaint, and he said that due to COVID, I wouldn't be able to access the complaint system. UNBELIEVABLE!!"
n/a,10,Moved our Flight....not even remotely close,"Our flight was changed one week before our trip. The change was significant and removed an entire day, which we had already planned for and around. Then the hold to get this figured out took hours. The company was unable to help us in any impactful way. The only reason we booked with this company was for the flight time, the least they could have done was help us rebook with their ""credit"" in a way that was helpful. Now we have either lost the flight money, or have to reschedule another trip with them. But why would we do that?"
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Demand money for hand luggage,"My flight was on Nov 20, departure 6:00am From Kiev Delta Air Lines DL 8210 (Operated by Klm Royal Dutch Airlines, KL1390) had one luggage and hand bag. Tatiana Kostianets’ badge #00558 told me that I have to weight my hand bag and told me that it was overweighted. She was rude, screaming, yelling, told me if I don’t pay $100 for a bag, flight will be canceled. I told her USA and Europe no one weighted my hand bag, she said I don’t care, sent me to her supervisor, name Волохонська Анжела Анатоліївна (in Ukrainian, second photo) didn’t let me see her badge number purposely. She told me the same if I don’t pay $100 for the bag my flight will be canceled. Most rude people I have ever saw. So I had to pay and get on the flight. Usually Delta is good to me everywhere but in Kiev..."
Date of travel: November 2020,20,Was never able to get onto the flight due to cancellations and rescheduling.,"It would be hard to rate their in flight experience if I could ever get onto the plane. I booked a trip in March and due to flight rescheduling they changed my flight from the afternoon to the morning. They were unable to find any flights remotely close to an afternoon flight out of the entire central IL area, let alone the airport I originally had planned to depart from. Then I tried to re-book for another flight in November, but again they not only changed the departure times but they also change the airport I was landing at. It wasn't even in the correct state and they did not offer any assistance to getting to where I had intended to go, with no flights available to that airport the entire week. The customer service reps where uncaring and not helpful (provided you could even get in touch with them as I waited 1+ hour on hold after receiving a callback). Every time I had to re-book with a different airline who was able to deliver the services they promised. All in all, I won't be traveling with Delta anytime soon as there are far superior airline companies who actually care about their customers."
n/a,10,We lose the perks b/c Delta makes changes,"We booked tickets on Delta One specifically for the perks of that flight. We would have a first class cabin similar to a transcontinental flight as well as Lounge access. Well Delta went and changed our flight and our plane, which meant we no longer got the perks of a Delta One cabin, and it lost us Lounge access because they don't consider standard first class worthy of lounge access. BUT THESE WERE ALL CHANGES DELTA MADE. The only reason we booked on Delta to begin with were for these specific perks and we end up with NONE whatsoever. We called customer service and all they said was ""sorry"". They wouldn't even give us a day pass to the Lounge. There's a reason we don't fly Delta... they were no help and we are still left with nothing. Boooooo"
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Security,"Security wouldn’t let me take my brand new travel size mouthwash through. Only containers of 3.5oz or smaller are allowed. What a waste of money, what good is a 3.5oz container of mouthwash if you’re going on a trip."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,The staff is terrible,"The lady at the counter thought my covid-19 test was wrong and took forever to confirm it, was too late to check my bags in so she sent me with 2 big bags through TSA, bunch of my stuff was confiscated because those were supposed to go under the plane and not through TSA (liquids, creams, etc). Missed my first connection  flight of 3, went back to counter to ask for help so they can give me another flight and not miss my last flight which was the important one and they didnt do anything, bounced the blame around and finally I had to buy another ticket from another airline to reach my last flight which was the important one. They have the worst customer service."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Poor customer service. Lack of communication.,Missed my flight with plenty of time to spare. Closed the door early then proceeded to ridicule me. Ill fly American next time.  Wasted my day
Date of travel: November 2020,50,A grateful Traveller,"I love flying Delta. You guys always take care of my travel needs. Thank you. Your aircrafts are clean and sterilized, your folks are always courteous and upright. Always with a smile. My only reservation right now is that I have to be very cognizant of my actions while trying to conform to mask wearing standards. I am respectful and do my part. I am a healthy individual and take my immune systems responsibility very seriously. I feel that me, as a healthy person, should not have to live in fear of reprisal because I am responsible for other people’s health just by the simple act of breathing. In my line of work I have to take a COVID-19 test at least twice a month. I take care of my health and welfare. I am only asking that you have some leniency on my NOT having to wear a mask while on board. I do have a medical condition that gives me anxiety, stress and migraines due to the lack of oxygen because I have to wear a mask. What can we do about this? Please advise and I look forward to your recommendations. Thank you. A grateful Traveller."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,DONT FLY DELTA,The whole gate staff was rude and needs to be fired. Very unprofessional as soon as I walked up to security the lady started yelling at me and when I went through the security gate they went through my purse and threw out all my lotions and perfumes and said I couldn’t have it on the plane they didn’t give me the opportunity to check my stuff and when I asked to have them back the supervisor told me to dig it out of the trash can and when the manager came she asked for my boarding pass and Identification and they held my boarding pass and ID for about 15 minutes and when they gave it back they told me to hurry I don’t have long before my flight leaves so when I got to the gate they scanned my pass and it came back that I couldn’t board my plane 10 minutes before departure. By the time I made it back home to Savannah I went through my checked bag and there was a notice in my bag saying by law they are allowed to go through my stuff my things were bald up in my bag and things were missing. All I can say is DONT FLY DELTA
Date of travel: November 2020,50,Now that's customer service!,"Delta proves themselves to be world-class every time.  They have gone above and beyond to provide a sanitized environment and comfortable amenities even in this COVID world.  The staff is quick to assist, super polite and friendly and the booking and gate agents are eager to help.  I cannot say enough good things about Delta - they rarely have issues but when occurs, they are quick to remedy it in a caring and timely fashion often going out of their way to do more than necessary to make it right. Just fly Delta and know that part of any trip is in good hands."
Date of travel: November 2020,20,We were lied to!,"I had to fly back to see my mom who was sick in the hospital for weeks! I had to extend my flight stay to take care of my mom. I was told by a Delta Agent that there was no charge the first time you modify your flight and change dates all the way up until December. So I extended my stay thinking I would not be charged however, I was charged $220. I tried to call Delta airlines and had the hardest time getting through to them and so decided to use their text messaging feature. I was told I be refunded the $220 to my bank card within 5-7 business days. It’s been over two weeks now and I still have not received my payment. There have been some other annoying inconvenience while flying with Delta so I decided I no longer will fly with them. On top of my mom being sick and almost losing her, I wish Delta would help take care of my flights and not make eveything even more stressful!"
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Horrible,We missed our connection from Atlanta to our destination because we sat in the plane in SLC for over a hour. To be told by Deltas customer service the next flight isn’t until tomorrow here is a hotel to stay at with this price!!!!!! I am calling corporate office as soon as I wake up tomorrow I want a refund for the money we spent to get to our destination on time not the next day!
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Stole 2400$ from me.,"Cancelled my flight and was told I was being given flight credit because they were refusing all refunds, and suddenly they've ""irreversibly lost"" my account and the included flight credit. Fly with anyone other than these parasites."
Date of travel: November 2020,10, BUYER BEWARE,Delta had a whole plane full of people miss their connections in SLC.   No compensation.   They rebook you for 7 hours later and say “next!”     You never forget a bad experience.
Date of travel: September 2020,10,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE. DISCUSTING SERVICE. 
DRIVEN BY GREED AND THIEVERY. 
THATS DELTA AIRLINES...",Absolutely terrible service. A situation arised and they wouldnt refund or do anything besides try to extort me out of yet more money with FEES THAT COST MORE THAN BOTH TICKETS. Extremely greedy. Will never be using this garbage company again. Customer commitment. THEY DONT KNOW WHAT THAT IS. After that. Its a big screw you and thanks for your cash. Not good service. Will not work with you if something happens. Strongly reccomended avoiding this greed pit. Its actually quite disgusting and shows how some airlines really operate. I take money seriously. I will never spend another cent here. I advise you dont. They need to go out of business if theft is their policy. Because they are essentially stealing with a smile. we just pretend its ok but its not. Built on thievery and extortion for bags on a plane.... This company is a true joke to tell your kids about. Not one person I know will ride this again. A lack of simply human gesture has now cost you multiple customers and I pray it coat you thousands more. Delta is truly a garbage company with a shiny sign.
Date of travel: November 2020,10,No thanks Delta not worth my life: No mask enforcement. You don't get a second strike on my health,"I just flew on Delta and masks were NOT enforced at all. Passengers blatantly boarded the plane walking by the flight attendant's with their noses hanging out of masks. I brought it to the attention of the flight attendant's and they acted like *I* was the problem when I mentioned to them that folks were sitting within 6 feet of me playing mask games. ""What can we do?"" was the response. Super disappointed as this has always been my favorite airline. Never again Delta. This isn't a game I'm willing to risk my life on, I have zero interest in allowing a strike 2 when it comes to my safety."
Date of travel: October 2020,50,Large passenger,"Delta was great the middle seat was open for covid so I was so comfortable. Being large I am always afraid to fly in case I have to buy 2 seats so I felt at ease that I would be ok. They gave me a seatbelt extension and on one of my flights I did not even need one and I fit in seat but it was great knowing I was not bothering the person next to me by being larger. I wish the middle seat out was always an option. I did pay extra for the extra leg room having a boot on a bad leg it was worth it. Also it gave me a free carry on above me,"
Date of travel: October 2020,20,Coronavirus confusion with coach service at first class prices,"Delta is my favorite US airline. We were excited to try their Delta One class because of their reputed excellent service and lie flat seats. Apparently, Delta is trying to save money by downgrading to convenience store quality food and drink during the coronavirus. In addition, the first class service frequency was exactly the same as coach. When I inquired as why we did not receive blankets/pillows on the return leg but we had on the outbound leg, the flight attendant confessed that they didn't know because of day to day changes and confusion. Unfortunately their prices are still first class. Our return flight also highlighted one of the unforseen dangers of allowing pets in the lie flat seat section, as the dog relieved itself on the owner's seat which dripped onto the extended lie flat seation of the passenger behind. The flight attendants apologized (while the owner condescendingly insisted that the liquid was water despite the urine odor) but said they could only give a voucher for $70 which didn't compensate for the agrevied passenger's ruined clothing."
Date of travel: November 2020,30,Delta discards platinum status,Delta discards platinum status of 1.5 million mile flyers for first class upgrades in preference to a single flight attendant for a first class ‘jump seat’ Why ?
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Pay to pick your seat,Remember to pay for the upgrade to let you pick your seats. There was a bigger bump in price than we had hoped for to be able to pick our seats. Other than that it was a smooth and nice flight. Seemed clean. Would fly again.
Date of travel: November 2020,30,Poor COVID-19 Enforcement,"When we touched down, Delta flight attendants did not enforce keeping people in their seats and letting people off one row at a time, instead allowing people to crowd the aisles waiting for the airplane door to open. Delta also did not enforce the mask rule, so another passenger was not wearing a mask and was standing in the aisle right next to us, and refused to put on a mask when asked politely by another passenger."
Date of travel: September 2020,40,Rebooking our flight for 2021,I always have a pleasant experience with Delta but this time it was 8 out of 10. I had a trip booked to Lima for September 2020 and unfortunately it got cancelled due to Covid. I did not get the refund but got e-credit and I’m ok with that. I paid 1500$ last time for business. This week I wanted to change my booking for next year and it’s 1900$ for 2021. So I paid 400$ extra as a fare difference. Sadly I didn’t get any free exchange alternatives. But it’s not my fault either that flight was cancelled. I think delta should provide at least 1 time free exchange for the same route and passengers. Without collecting any fees. That would be fair. Besides that I love delta and their Delta One Suites.
Date of travel: November 2020,50,Ticket counter hours,Had a 0600hrs flight out of ORD and couldn’t find any info as to what time the Delta ticket counter opened. Turns out it opens at 0430hrs.
Date of travel: October 2020,50,One of the best (if not THE BEST) Airlines out there,"Absolutely LOVED this airline. Prices are reasonable, service is exceptional, and for the last ten years, I've flown on Delta, I've NEVER had a problem with the boarding process (of course except for my first time but I was new to flying so...). They have also done a splendid job with social distancing while continuing to give exceptional service during these times. This is the airline anyone can trust."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Companion tickets/customer service are worthless,"Delta supposedly offers you a companion ticket which can't be redeemed for any reasonably timed flight. We are trying to book a trip with an infant and the website would not allow us to book/redeem companion certificate. We had tried to called customer service 5-10 times and either were transferred to the wrong department or the representative just disappeared half way through the conversation. We were given a direct number for companion certificate bookings and no one answers. There are literally 24 flights on the day of our return flight and the options we are given are waking a baby up at 5:30 am for an 8am flight or getting home at 9pm or 11pm. It did not used to be this hard redeeming the companion certificate or the insane amount of flight restrictions. And the customer service is horrible however that is nothing new. If you are contemplating getting the Delta Amex for the companion certificate, don't bother!"
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Rude rude rude,"Will never fly this airline again. My problem started before I ever got on the plane. Here’s the email I sent customer service. I have a long flight today, I haven’t even boarded the plane and already I’m regretting flying delta. I can promise this will be the last time. The woman at the gate “Adriana”was so rude and cold it’s hard to put into words. Never in my life have I seen so many people get on a plane upset before from one person. How does this woman still have a job speaking to people the way she does? She is a liability waiting to happen. Had I had my phone out instead of carrying my passport and personal item I would post it and it would go viral. Standing in the line on the actual plane everyone was complaining about the same woman and how she spoke to them, though how many will make a complaint is unknown. As I approached the gate to scan my ticket the woman was confiscating every bag she didn’t like and putting it into checked bags even when a woman begged her about he babies diapers and special blanket so he would stay sleeping etc. it was actually pretty sad to watch and her bag was not that big. Next comes me and instantly she says “that bag isn’t getting on the plane, it’s going underneath”. Mind you I bought a set of luggage from brookestone for 900 dollars and this one is literally engraved carry on and says TSA complaint on it, I would submit photos but it was taken from me. I tried to explain this to her but she just kept talking over me and then she replied “apparently you don’t know what a carry on is” and points to a guy behind me exclaiming “that is a carryon” which his bag was no bigger then a small gym bag, then she said “get it right next time and you won’t have a problem”. I was still reluctant about giving her my bag as I have a gift for my girlfriend for her birthday in it which is somewhat fragile (she lives in Korea, which is my final destination). She said to me “give me the bag and your credit card right now or you’re not getting on the plane, learn how to judge the size of a bag” with a tone that would make someone cringe at the sound. Not only was this woman loud and rude she was also very rough with my bag and snatched it away from me. That bag was extremely expensive to me as I don’t make that kind of money but since I travel a bit (not on delta anymore) I figured I would upgrade my bag. I brought that one with me today specifically because it says carry on on it and did not want to check a bag. The person behind me said to me “it’s not worth it” as he could see me getting angry. My entire day/flight/experience is already ruined. I honestly wish at this very moment I could get my money back and just fly Asiana or Korean air like I had originally wanted and low and behold my gut was right. Not only was I talked to disrespectfully but it was in front of an entire gate full of people. How embarrassing! This woman needs to be relocated to somewhere that she does not have to deal with people, or just let go altogether as this woman is a lawsuit waiting to happen. If there is anything damaged in or on my bag I fully plan on following this through and possibly taking action against delta legally for the way I was spoken to along with the countless others around me who’ve all exchanged numbers Incase something needs to be done. Now you’re probably sitting there thinking these people are overboard, no!!! It was ACTUALLY that bad. I have a very expensive gift in that bag and I am a nervous wreck right now along with belittled and embarrassed. I paid over 1000 dollars for this ticket to be treated this way. It’s people like her that will ruin business for delta. I pledge from here on out never to fly this airline again unless something is done about this. After I land I plan on calling corporate or a lawyer if I have to until I get some sort of correspondence. Please write me back at my email or call me at your earliest convenience."
Date of travel: November 2020,10,No service,Delta is a more expensive ticket. There is no service on this plane now. You are given a zip loc bag of tiny snacks and a tiny bottle of water. No alcohol like the other airlines offer. Not happy.
Date of travel: September 2020,50,Please buy out American Airlines!!,"Delta!! Please put American Airlines out of their misery and end it already! Delta has some outstanding customer service and updated planes with TVs? What? You have TVs? No wayyyy!!! Ha! So yes the best airline each and every time I fly.  These others like Frontier, Spirit are only good for cheap flights but you get cheap accommodations and seats etc. Jet blue is good I hear but never flown! Anyway back to DELTA THE BEST AIRLINE in the USA (can’t compare to foreign airlines) please please keep up the great work!!!!"
Date of travel: November 2020,10,Very poor service,"We are told to check in 3 HOURS before our 6:10am flight. Others around us are having the same issue. We can’t check into our flight because the stupid kiosk would not scan my wife’s or my passports. When it finally took it, we need an agent HAS TO CHECK US IN and none will be here until 4am. This is ridiculous and very poor service if you expect customers to check in 3 hours prior to their flight to make it through customs and get checked in."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Expect downgrades on your schedule without notice and Delta will want to charge you to change it back,"I understand how covid impacted the industry. I’m not OK how Delta changed my schedule without notice. I have not seen my family in 1 1/2 years. Now you are making me travel across US because rescheduling my trip (8+ hours travel time); funny customer service wants me to pay ticket cost if I want to change it. Really nice to see how even after covid you find a way to stick your problems into the customer, I flew 10+ years with Delta, but after this experience, never again!"
Date of travel: August 2020,50,Delta really is the best airline to fly.,I’ve flown every major airline across the world. Delta does is better overall.  No frills but solid dependable staff and flights are on time most of the time.  Maybe it has to do with Atlanta as its home bass and that southern hospitality but works Great.
n/a,50,An airline which cares about people,"Clearly Delta sees the value in putting people before profits during these crazy times of a health pandemic. By limiting capacity, blocking seats, minimizing touch points, thoroughly cleaning between flights, and requiring everyone to wear face masks, I never felt unsafe or exposed to COVID-19 at any point during the journey.  While service on board is limited, that hasn't changed the fact their staff provide great service experiences and truly care about the customer."
Date of travel: October 2020,50,Wonderful Customer Support Experience,"Overall I think Delta is one of the best airlines in the business.  The planes tend to be clean and well maintained, staff is usually professional and friendly, and flights tend to be as reliable as they can be.  I am writing a review because I recently had a wonderful customer support experience and it further solidified my belief and appreciate for Delta.  I recently spoke with a Delta Customer Support Supervisor based in SLC named Dave S.  Dave was professional, helpful, patient, and understanding.  I had a few issues with an upcoming flight i was trying to book and Dave stayed on the phone with me to help make sure they were all resolved. One issue was with seating as I was going to be traveling with my elderly mother- I was concerned about us not being able to sit together on an international flight due to some ticket restrictions, but Dave helped make sure we could be together and relieved much of my anxiety and stress I had felt about the flight and traveling with my mother.  In a time in the world right now where this so much darkness and uncertainty, Dave's kindness was the light i needed to remember there are good people out there.  I hope Delta recognizes stellar employees such as Dave.  Delta will continue to be my airline of choice"
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Terrible service,Hated the service never again. Seriously waste experience ever. Rude. I travelled with them 1st time never again for sure.
Date of travel: October 2020,40,Good flight. Watch layover times,"Very good attention to COVID requirements, from check-in to baggage claim.  Flight attendants were attentive, and friendly..One hour layover in MSP, planes were at the total opposite of the airport - damn near impossible to do. Not much food -  nothing available for purchase."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,No leadership mis management,Going back home to boston flight attendant insisting that my 2 year old that just turned 3  puts the mask on and keeps it on- on 30 minute flight to eventually get kicked out after the captain and her manager and all the passengers had no problem with it and their online policy says otherwise for young children. on top of it was told I would get $0 refund for being kicked out. Woooooooooooow
Date of travel: October 2020,30,Do NOT recommend,"Delta states they care about your safety but when people bord the plane recording on there phone, they do nothing. I asked the person who recorded my face if they would block out my person, and he said ""are you kidding"" when I brought it up to the flight attendant the captain asked if my husband and I had a problem and would like to Debord the plane......um I did NOTHING WRONG. The person INVADING MY PRIVACY was not asked to debord, was not asked to delete the video, and I will NEVER fly delta again because my PRIVACY is my SAFETY! Not just my health."
Date of travel: November 2019,10,Terrible Experience,Never (and I travel a lot) have I experienced such a bad experience (especially in first class).  I had to turn around backwards in order to get out of my seat to go to the isle.I will never travel Delta again.
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Piss poor customer service,"The day we left for our honeymoon, we got to the air port 2 1/2 hours early for our 7:05 flight. There were 3 staff working the baggage check line and it took us almost 2 hours just to get to the line. By the time we got to our gate the lady working the desk told us sorry we have shut the door. Mind you there was 5 others that were on the flight that missed it due to this wait time. Our bags were loaded on the plane so we now had no change of clothes and missed a day of our honeymoon. The lady at the gate desk who so unwilling to help and told us to go talk to someone on the help line. That was the biggest waist of time and the absolute WORST customer service I have ever experienced!!! The lady on the phone said it was our fault and if we wanted to rebook we would have to pay. Also we now had to get another hotel room for the night that cost us $180.00 before we even left the state. Again worst possible customer experience with baggage check, the gate operator and the service people on the help line. I wouldn’t recommend anyone to Delta if they asked me about their customer service and how they treat their customers."
Date of travel: October 2020,40,Easy enough flight,"We flew in economy from Salt Lake City to Portland, OR, in October 2020.Kudos to Delta for how it is handling the COVID-19 pandemic.  There was ample signage about mask wearing and distancing, the boarding process was organized and distanced, and they were blocking middle seats on the aircraft.We enjoyed the (brand new) Delta SkyClub at SLC.  It’s a huge, beautiful space with a nice variety of seating options and great design.  They did a nice job maintaining food service options during COVID-19, with many single-serving items on-offer.  It’s an environmental nightmare with all of the plastic, but it was good to see that they hadn’t completely eliminated food, etc.The new airport at SLC is very nice, with lots of light, big hallways (that help prevent boarding lines from spilling into where people are trying to walk), and large seating areas at the gates.  Onboard, service was extremely limited:  a bag with Biscoff cookings, some water, and Cheez-Its.  FAs also walked through to offer beer or wine.  However, on a relatively short segment, this level of service was acceptable.  De-planing was very organized and distanced, too.  The A321 was very clean, and the entertainment system offered a really nice variety of options.Overall, a good experience."
Date of travel: October 2020,30,OK Experience,"We flew from Chicago O’Hare to Salt Lake City on a Saturday morning.  I was excited for this flight, on a new airplane, the A220.  Overall, we had an OK experience; I felt it was somewhat below the standard I expect from Delta.The check-in line at ORD was very long; not enough agents were working.  The agent who assisted with check-in was not rude, but also not especially friendly, unusual for Delta.  I did appreciate that they had hand sanitizer dispensers throughout the check-in line.Our visit to the Delta SkyClub at ORD impressed; they are doing a great job with the clubs during COVID-19, maintaining a nice selection of food that is now served entirely in self-service containers.  It’s an environmental nightmare in-terms of single-use plastics, but I appreciated that they maintained service levels in the lounge. Guests were adequately distanced; the lounge was not busy.Our gate agent at ORD was awful.  She was in a bad mood.  She forgot to process the upgrade list until reminded.  She did not offer any pleasantries during the boarding process.  And, worst of all, despite all of the signage reminding passengers to wear their masks, etc., she wore hers below her chin.Onboard personnel were much better.  However, onboard service was extremely limited:  basically, water, wine, or beer.  Coffee was not on-offer; it was a bit hard to figure out what would make serving a cup of coffee in a paper cup a COVID-19 problem.  First class passengers were offered a snack box, which was a nice gesture, but it was full of processed snacks rather than fresh food.The A220 is a nice airplane and was sparkling clean; the entertainment screen was large and the selection robust.  However, the design of the first class seats was idiotic; the armrest between seats runs all the way to the floor, meaning that there was almost zero under seat storage for either passenger.  That was fine on this flight, since first class was half-full due to Delta’s seat blocking policy.  However, on a full flight during normal times, this would be very annoying for anyone carrying a briefcase.Overall, for Delta, a disappointing experience."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,despicable practices,They canceled my flight arbitrarily.    I paid extra for a convenient flight time.  Now they are offering the inconvenient time at the same price.     Cutting my 6 day vacation down to 4 and giving me red eye flights.     no compensation or refund.
Date of travel: October 2020,50,Excellent Service - DFW Sky Club and In Flight,"It was indeed a pleasure to be flying with my favorite airline again and to be welcomed back by the friendly and helpful staff at the Sky Club. Very glad to see the familiar faces of a few long time staff there. The place was spotless and all breakfast items were individually wrapped. Starbucks coffee was ready and hot. The flight departed and landed very much on time with every precaution taken to ensure social distancing, etc. for passengers. Cleanliness is obvious. The attendants were friendly and added much humor in their announcements. They even managed to collect $300 in donations for breast cancer. They made us smile and give with alacrity. Please see photos."
Date of travel: July 2020,20,Rainy Travel during Covid,"Part -2 of my Trip, from Texas back to GA,  The rain Cause a delay on my return. We were a HOUR Late leaving San Antonio (SAT) when we finally got to ATL, I'd MISSED my flight back to Savannah, and as luck would have it that was the LAST flight of the evening. The had booked my in a""discount hotel"" or so they said...   BUT it was at my expense!!! I almost had a COW!!...   They screwed up, not me, the Customer service agent was rude, apparently from dealing a Plane FULL of un-happy passengers, informed me that they weren't responsible for weather conditions, and THIS was the best he could do for me, besides re-booking for for a flight some 17 hours later (1st flight available, or so he said) the Discount Hotel was NO discount, $134 for the night.   I declined, and opted to sleep in the airport. lesson learned expect ZERO SUPPORT from Delta if you get rained in somewhere."
Date of travel: July 2020,30,Business Trip during Covid=19,"I was concerned, about my safety for (during) this trip. The Pandemic had just been going 3 months, but showed sign of easing off. I was curious How many restrictions I would face. But I had little choice this was company ticket (training) from my house (GA) to Texas I had to wear mask thew whole way. (except when eating/drinking) Nobody really seemed to mind, the mask (yet) EVERYBODY wore them Pilot's/crew/ counter people...Customers. I was upset by the new restriction paying for 1 bag, I figured 1st bag free. After all, I was gonna be gone 4 days. So I CRAMMED everything in a backpack (carry on)  and dealt with the situation.  It was good thing I checks how many bags. before hand. The fight it self went ok.... just seemed longer with the Mask in place. They had a ""pre made snack bag"" ready for you IF you wanted...   Thank God it was free.!! (bottle water, Cheese it's, ganollia bar)I wouldn't of payed for it otherwise."

Date of travel: October 2020,50,Great service and communication. Easy travel!,"Our family of six found the flights very comfortable. There was a good deal of turbulence and winds and communication in preparation for it was so great from the pilots and the flight attendants. Pilots handled the plane in the winds in an impressive manner, especially on the flight back into Kalispell--super easy soft landing in the winds! They are only giving out snack packs at this time but they are just right, including a small bottle water and cheezits, cookes, and of course, a sani-wipe. Friendly service for sure!"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Top choice for US origin Flights,Best US based airline in my opinion. The conditions of the plane and entertainment options are always great. The staff is also always nice and polite! It's also good to have consistent Wifi availability on all international and domestic flights when booking with Delta!
Date of travel: October 2020,50,Great service,"Very nice, good service, clean, efficient. I will absolutely use them again. I made a mistake by using a different airline on the return trip, but as i said, a mistake."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Unprofessional customer service does not know how to book a pet for an international flight plus outrageous hold times,Spent about 20 hours on hold this week trying to book a spot for my pet cat. Every agent tells me something different and no one knows what is happening. Completely unprofessional. Additionally hold time says usually 5 to 10 minutes but is always an hour or more. I'm refunding my tickets and moving to an airline who values it's customers.
Date of travel: October 2020,40,care for safety,"this was a great flight - attentive to our pandemic world. Promoted social distancing, sanitized plane before boarding, gave out wipes, gave snack bags, and enforced masks. Flight was on time or early. Friendly staff. good flights."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Abandoned in Detroit,"I paid an additional $1,199.10 to change from a 5 p.m. flight to a 2:50 p.m. flight as I wanted more time to make a connecting flight in DTW. We missed our connection in Detroit due to the multiple mechanical issue delays on the flight from MCO for which I had paid the additional fare. We arrived home 16 hours late after being stranded overnight in Detroit without our bags and despite asking, no provision of meal or hotel vouchers. We were pointed to a bank of phones to rebook the flight as the gate agent was unwilling to help. No one knew what would happen to our bags. We had no boarding passes for the rescheduled flight and I couldn't get them from the kiosk. When we finally got some from check-in, my daughter's seat was changed at the last moment to not allow for distancing. The only other option they offered her was to wait another 6 hours to be rebooked again on an evening flight. Our overall experience does not line up with several points in section 12 of the Delta Customer Commitment which points to meal/hotel provisions for delays and assistance for rebooking. After a series of communications on various platforms, the airline has offered some compensation. This does not cover lost work hours or cost of the original flight change. More importantly, it does ease the lasting negative feelings of being abandoned in big US city in the middle of the night, during a pandemic."

Date of travel: July 2020,10,Do NOT fly delta or lose your $$,"I don't typically write reviews, but this review is very necessary. I purchased flight tickets in jan/feb all using the same card (have emails and proof) and then covid-19 happened and as we all know we couldn't travel. I tried getting in touch with delta on the phone for weeks and it went to an answering machine and hung up on me. Then, I spent time researching how to get ahold of them so I sent in a refund request online (no response) and then finally got a representative ON TWITTER. They processed my refund in June and the refund was never received. They sent me a link where it said my refund was sent to some random credit card. So, then I texted a representative and they said oh no it was processed on your card on file. And I said well I never got my refund and on the website it says a different card. She literally says ""I'm sorry?"" And she said i have to contact my bank because once its processed they can't do anything on their end and that hopefully my bank can help. Im like REALLY?? so 1500 bucks im out and I knew it wasn't my banks fault. I called my bank and they said they never received it. So I had to file a claim. That has been an extremely slow process and still haven't been refunded the money. So, then I file a complaint because this whole thing has been BS and that rep again said they refunded me on that random card AND my actual card... that is a flat out lie because all the charges show on my credit card (even my banker saw them) and the emails show the correct card number. I told the rep it was the wrong number and I've never had that credit card. They did NOTHING. Worst customer service ever and if my bank doesn't refund me I will be looking into an attorney because this is totally wrong of them and others are having this problem. Meanwhile, alaska airlines refunded me the money in 2 weeks. Oh and the refund that was processed from delta was from MY BANK. I used points for the trip and they refunded those points back with no help of delta. Do NOT fly delta."
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Ticket - call cneter,"Horrible service at the call center, NEVER BOOKING A FLIGHT AGAIN! they lied to me 3 times. I called at first to change my date; the lady said it will be $269 for both tickets, I asked her twice about it, she charged me $538. In the second call, another lady stated that she can cancel the itinerary and refund me the original ticket and the fixed ticket. SHE LIED, your people at the call center don't know about the company's policies. Third call, when I asked to speak to a supervisor the guy lied to me again and said he was a supervisor, he said the original ticket will be refunded in 30 days and the fixed ticket in 7 days. ANOTHER LIE! 2 months later I had to call again because the original ticket was not refunded. In the fourth call I had to argue with a lady because she stated that the original ticket was not refundable, I knew that but I would have not accept the cancellation of the original ticket if the second lady would have not lie to me about the refund. WASTE OF TIME AND ENERGY, I'll never do business again!"
Date of travel: September 2020,50,AMAZING SERVICE!,"We booked with Delta Airlines through Flighthub for our trip to Europe from Seattle. We got an epic deal which was $557/pp. However, due to COVID-19 we were unable to fly. I submitted a request for refund over the phone on Sept 1st, 2020. I called back Oct 8th, 2020 as our refund still had not come through. The request was processed again and we recieved the refund on the same date. THANK YOU Delta Airlines (Nick) for this refund as opposed to a credit. Cant wait to rebook for a trip in the future!"

Date of travel: October 2020,50,Amazing service,"Recently flew from Austin to Ft. Meyers, Florida on 10/3...connection through Atlanta. I was flying with a one and four year old by myself.  It was the most amazing flight experience I’ve had in 10Years. Plane was clean, service was amazing, attendants were the most friendly I’ve encountered in over a decade. If I can, I will only fly Delta domestic from now on."
Date of travel: October 2020,20,No more first class amenities ,When you book a first class trip you expect a better level of service. NOPE! No more alcohol served!! Main cabin got snacks and drinks before first class did! Will not recommend Delta to anyone anymore. Very disappointed in the price difference from main cabin to first and only thing different is seat and baggage is included. Not worth it! This picture is hilarious! What a joke!
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Damage package,"In the month of September I flew by Delta Airlines, was around 12 hours flight. When I landed I had to drive for 1 more hour to my destination, after I arrived I had to do a lot of paperwork and stuff for my job and was so tired and decided to sleep until next day. The next day when I was taking stuff out of my bag I noticed it was damage. I reported the damage to Delta Customer Service and they said I waited too long and they won't pay anything back for the damage.How do you pretend a person who travels for more than 15 hours immediately report a damage bag ?I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND TO FLIGHT IN THIS AIRLINE WHO DO NOT CARE ABOUT HOW THEY TAKE CARE OF THE CUSTOMERS."
Date of travel: October 2020,10,Terrible Airline And Customer Service,I had issues with both Gloria and Kay. I booked my seats all together with my family and 24 hours before our flight they changed one of the seats to a different row. After calling to have them changed I was told I could not because I was never allowed to book my own seats in the first place. Instead of helping us we were told that they could do absolutely nothing for us. Why would be able to book them in the first place with an email confirming our chosen seats just to have them changed and have us told we are imagining things.I would absolutely never recommend this airline to anyone!
Date of travel: October 2020,50,Well Done Delta!,"WOW!! What a great experience flying with Delta. They loaded us from the back to the front which really sped things up and kept people from bumping into each other on the way to our seats. They had everyone separated by an empty seat. They handed out bags with a small bottled water, cheez-its, a cookie and a hand wipe as you boarded the plane. The staff communicated with us. It was a lovely experience for my husband and I. We will fly Delta again.Mr. & Mrs. Sanders"
Date of travel: October 2020,20,Disappointed by Lack of Mask Enforcement,"Although I applaud Delta for continuing to block some seats as a I know many airlines are not doing this, mask wearing was not strictly enforced on one of my flights. Although most passengers were wearing them correctly, there was someone without a mask entirely and others who had them down below their noses or chins for the entire flight. I traveled due to a death in the family and chose Delta because they were one of two airlines still blocking seats that I could choose from for my particular destination. However, I felt unsafe being surrounded by people not wearing masks correctly or at all. Delta staff could have easily corrected this though did not. I would not fly on Delta again during the pandemic."
Date of travel: October 2020,20,Not clean as they should due to covid,We flew our entire trip on delta and our last flight from Salt Lake city to redmond oregon was disappointing number 3580.. They advertise everywhere that they sanitize the plane between trips and we get to our seat and there is chip crumbs all over both of our seat !? Like so obviously they didn't even clean the plane let alone sanitize....makes me wonder if anything around us was sanitized during the time we were waiting so long to board...With how strict things are right now and covid I would hope they are actually trying a little to keep everyone safe beside handing us purell wipes.
Date of travel: October 2020,50,Excellent Flights,"Both flights to and from were great.  Going we boarded last but felt safe traveling during the pandemic.  Due to pandemic the food was limited to snacks and for drinks, water was provided and just beer or wine for alcohol.  Luggage came off plane early which was nice.  Flight attendants were nicer going then coming back.  High winds from tropical storm made the return take off a little bumpy but the rest of the flight was smooth.  On time arrivals for both flights."
Date of travel: September 2020,50,Delta One from Amsterdam to Detroit,"Despite ongoing issues with Covid-19, I was looking forward to the flight which is my first in an Airbus A350 and in  a Delta One suite.  The aircraft was very new, and looked in excellent condition.  One surprise was the lack of luggage storage bins over the middle seats of the Delta One cabin.  Had the flight been full, then there could have been an issue with lack of storage space.  However, the Delta One cabin was half full, at most.  I had been curious about the Delta One suites, noting previous positive reviews.  I had booked into seat 3B, and noted that entry into the suite was restricted - this was not an issue with seat 2B on the return journey.  To be frank, I found the suite to be somewhat claustrophobic, even by leaving the door open.  The seat, which converted into a fully flat bed, was pleasantly wide but was fairly uncomfortable.  [To put this into perspective, I make similar comments  about seats in all the Airbus models, including the A320, A330, A340 and A380 for multiple airlines].  Extra lighting in the suite would have been useful as I like to read during long haul flights - this was very difficult once the main cabin lights were switched off.  The Delta service was excellent with tasty meals and snacks, and attentive, friendly cabin staff.  Overall, I prefer the former Delta One seats, and would not rush to make further bookings for the suites.  Having flown on Air France and KLM  Boeing 787s  and now the Delta A350, my preference is certainly with the former."
Date of travel: September 2020,50,Flying during the Covid 19 pandemic,"Our flight was on 24 September on an A350-900, Delta One cabin with suite seats.  My husband found the seats claustrophobic.  You are very enclosed but also very private.  We were in the centre 2 seats and for people travelling together there is a sliding panel that you can open to see each other.  There are no overhead bins for luggage in the centre section which I found inconvenient.  The cabin was not full but most of the window seats on both sides were taken whereas the middle 2 seats were mostly unoccupied.  The crew were welcoming and helpful as Delta cabin crews generally are.  The meals were served on a single tray rather than separately as before the covid pandemic and no pre-departure drink was offered, instead a bottle of water was left at your seat.  There was an option to choose your entree before your flight but you could also choose once on the plane.  Face coverings over the nose and mouth were required for the duration of the flight except when eating and drinking.  We were dreading wearing face coverings for our journey that had 3 flights involved so between airports and on the planes, we wore face coverings for over 20 hours.  Having said that, it was not as unbearable as we thought it would be.  Perhaps the most important thing is that we felt safe flying with Delta trans-Atlantic during the pandemic.  Hand wipes were given out upon boarding, the plane was immaculately clean and as far as I could tell our fellow passengers cooperated with the wearing of face coverings."
Date of travel: October 2020,50,Best customer service,"I don’t remember everyones’ names but best customer service ever! Although we never made it to our destination, Cancun... and we had the worst 36 hours of flights being delayed and stuck in Atlanta, everyone that helped us from entering the doors at the airport to the phone calls were amazing. Christina, over the phone was so patient with me, I appreciate her so much for understanding how stressed out I was. I also want to thank Delta for refunding our money for the cancelled trip. They were the only company that were willing to give us our money back. As for Spirit, they didn’t want to do crap or even listen. My hotel that was never available due to the hurricane also didn’t want to refund us. Thank you Delta!"

Date of travel: October 2020,50,During COVID flights are phenomenal,"Delta airlines has always been one of my favorite airlines, but during COVID they have excelled. I flew to Austin (first flight during this pandemic) and as always the customer service is great. As soon as you stepped on the plane they gave you sanitizing wipes so you could wipe your hands and area if you chose, and immediately cane and collected all the used wipes. The planes were very clean and you felt safe. There was AT LEAST one seat between people but they gave me a whole row to myself. During the flight they gave us a pre-sealed snack kit with bottled water, hand sanitizer, and some snacks. Not a lot but it was a short flight. Also for boarding they sat people in the back first and worked towards the front so you wouldn’t have to walk past people and have as much contact, and same with debarking they had the people in front of you get ready and out first. I think they are doing a great job especially in these weird times! Thank you Delta!"

I have not flown on Delta in the past, It will be my first choice from this day forward. From the front counter where I was treated with respect, professionalism and a personal touch. To the screening process. While at the gate counter, I asked for a little time to board the plane, a few knee replacements have me a little slow. I was offered early boarding. This is much appreciated. With all the dynamics over covid 19, The plane was clean, restrooms, every thought possible was given to everyone's safety. Thank you for the snacks to hold us over. Each step of my trip, changing planes three times, each step was consistent, professionalism from each team member. A personal thought, first part of October, CEO, Ed Bastian. Was interviewed on CNN. His remarks supported my plan to put Delta first to fly with. Mr. Bastian, commented on the truth of wearing a mask, as he implemented on April 30th,2020. To the process of each team member to insure that the new regulations of Covid 19 are addressed at the highest level. Mr. Bastian stayed away from politics, stayed true to the issues. Shared how many of us are policing one another to wear masks. Thank you Mr. Bastian. This world needs more heart of heart gentlemen as yourself, strong leaders of company's. Basilio Miranda Jr"

I am a colored person and singled out by white staff member while other German white folks can pass thru smoothly. I went to Germany for a one day executive company meeting and Delta white staff member at DUS airport do not believe that company send me to Germany for a one day meeting (she was thinking i have a hidden agenda). Be careful with Delta when you travel international routes with them especially when you are non-white person. Only response I receive was the attendant did not recall this incident and doing her job. I have travellied with American and United from Germany several times but never had this bad experience.

Date of travel: September 2020,50,Excellent Covid Precautions on All the Legs of Our Trip,"Quick reservations since funerals dictate that. No problem getting flights or excellent seats in Comfort Plus. Biggest draw back is that Delta doesn't have any direct flights from San Diego to Chicago, so connections had to be made. They left the middle seats empty on all four of our legs and that was quite nice. The planes were less than 50% full and it made for easy boarding and deplaning. Flight attendants were all very friendly and helpful and the flights were uneventful. Every leg was either right on time or a bit early. In light of the Covid precautions that Delta has in place, we will certainly fly with them again."
Date of travel: January 2020,20,Flying first class is no different from any other class,"I am a loyal Delta customer. I have been now on 3 outrageous experiences. I was last year a Diamond Medallion member.  This year I was removed from a flight from MSP to Israel because I complained about the purser coughing and coughing touching everything..... this was on the cusp of COVID19 and I was informed and concerned. I only every fly Delta One period. I was amazed they came to my seat and asked me to come outside where they stated they were removing me..... I was not inebriated, I was not rude, I had asked for a bag of chips, I was not disruptive whatsoever.  It appears that Delta made assumptions and despite my history of flying multiple first class flights mostly to London they mistreated me."
Date of travel: September 2020,40,They're trying harder than most these days,"I was skeptical and only flew with them because their flight best matched my schedule, but I have to say they've made improvements since the last time. Almost makes me wish they were my preferred airline now. To begin with, they're the only US airline still making a solid commitment to keep seats open during COVID. Some say they'll ""try,"" while others admit they do nothing. But Delta actually does. Flight attendants and check-in crew were actually very nice -a notable departure from United. They're still giving you a free snack and drink on short domestic flights. Not much, but it's better than some. Free movies even on a 2 hour flight. Basic economy does mean a surcharge for checked luggage, and it doesn't guarantee seats together. But with flights not running full during COVID, I figured it was a risk worth taking, and I was right. No one is getting stuck in that middle seat these days. And they weren't fascistic sticklers about our slightly overweight luggage or size of our carry-ons."
Date of travel: September 2020,50,2020 visit to Cancun,"Flew from Atlanta to Cancun in September 2020. The flight itself was nice. The stewardesses were very attentive and were always checking to see if we needed anything. The pilots did a good job of getting us there as we had to deviate from the normal route due to a hurricane in the gulf. I have to fly first class due to a back injury and need the legroom and comfy seats. Highly recommend it if you need extra space. The amenities were not the same as in previous years due to the whole COVID-19 thing. My only issue was the fact that you get told that the plane is sanitized before you board which I think is a great idea however when my wife and I boarded the was hair and other ""substances"" on the area in which we were to place our drinks so not sure how much I believe the whole ""sanitized for your protection"" things were were told."

Prior to traveling my sons dog chewed the corner of my passport, I attempted to get a new one but was told by the government passport office that because of Covid there was no way possible to get a new one in time and my only option was to travel with it. Originally we were to fly United and i went and asked if it would be accepted and was told yes, I got the same answer from TSA. The morning of travel(we were changed last minute to Delta) I went to the ticket counter and was told by an extremely rude agent that I would not even be allowed to step on their plane(all identifying information was legible and not disturbed) I tried to explain the steps that I took and that there was no way to get a new passport before we flew because we are in the middle of a pandemic....the ticket agent responded with ""to bad"" she then walked away and left us standing there looking at each other. She also told me that I should have checked with the customs office.....we are in the middle of Nebraska!! I understand that there are rules, my biggest complaint is that.....we are in a pandemic, sometimes exceptions can/need to be made and the agent was so rude, i was so defeated after being treated like that and then watching my kids leave on what was possibly the last vacation I would have been able to go on with them."

I was anxious to fly home to my asthmatic, diabetic mother during COVID and heard Delta was the best so I booked my ticket with them. I was beyond impressed. The minute you walked on the plane you could tell it was clean, refreshed, and sanitized. They boarded only ten people at a time, sat people in every other row, and ensured no one reserved the seat next to you to maintain distance. Everyone, including flight attendants and passengers, wore masks the whole time, they handed out snacks in pre-packaged baggies, and had sanitizing wipes available on the plane. I am no longer hesitant to fly as long as it is with Delta. 10/10 recommend, thank you Delta!"
Date of travel: October 2019,10,They are thieves!,"My husband and I bought a flight by Delta airline to go to Germany. What we did not know was that in order to layover in the United States I have to have some sort of visa, because my passport doesn’t qualify to step in the USA without Visa, delta didn’t tell us anything about this rules and they just accepted our money. So, we find out the same day of the flight about this cause of a friend. I called delta to explain the situación and their solution was to cancel the flight but without refund and just gave me a credit with less money than what I paid ( they called it cancellation fees). But the thing is that I don’t want to request any xxxx visa to layover in the States which I have to pay extra for ( money that I don’t have by the way) when I actually can just book a flight with another company with whom I don’t have to pay any extra Visa to fly with.

Date of travel: September 2020,10,Always expect a problem,"At least Delta is consistent but trip set out to be different.  We were flying American this time round trip from Pensacola to Charlotte but with Tropical Storm Sally heading towards the coast we needed to abbreviate our vacation by a day. American got us on a Delta flight, we arrived at the gate, the attendant announced it was on time. Then the text messages began flying. The attendant said she had bad news; our plane had a mechanical problem and had arrived the night before but no one had fixed it. So now every passenger had to be rescheduled! If that wasn’t enough, Delta put us on another connecting flight through Atlanta arriving later that day. We were concerned about each hour later in the day holding an increased chance of cancelled flights and went to the customer service desk. Voila, there were open seats on an American direct flight to Pensacola that got us there earlier. We had to call Delta back to get this change made but they did switch us to the other carrier. Good move! It’s sad that most of our experiences with Delta have been very similar!!"

If your mask slips an 1/8th of an inch before your nostrils for a half second while eating they will threaten to kick you off and make sure you are watched like a hawk for the flight(even if theirs isn’t on properly) They are racist, they are disrespectful, they are ignorant, they are hypocritical, will not fly with this disgusting company ever again. Fly ANY other company!! God bless america, let’s continue to fight racism against white, black, Asian, or any creed. Americans are united as one and we need to stand against anti American division. God bless America and I hope you all choose to abandon this communistic company. Don’t be a mean person and stop being a sheep."
Date of travel: September 2020,50,Thank you for the awesome experience!,"I recently traveled with Delta airline from Houston to Rapid City,  SD (connected thru Minneapolis), and had an awesome experience. It was my very first trip during covid pandemic. I was anxious at first but Delta staff made me feel very safe throughout the entire process. Upon boarding, the flight attendant gave everyone a prepackaged antibacterial wipe. During the flight, the flight attendant handed out a ziplock bag that contains a bottle water, 2 snacks, hand sanitizer and napkins. The flight was not packed and everyone had 2 seats/or a row to themselves. For a moment I forgot that we were in the middle of a pandemic. I felt safe at all point of the flight. All of Delta staff were very nice and courteous. Sadly the pandemic affects everyone in the travel industry but when it's over or there's a vaccine, I'm looking forward to travel with Delta again."
Date of travel: August 2020,20,Used to like Delta.  What happened?!,"Worst flight I have experienced in a long time.  Now, I have had my share of bad flights, but this was something else.  After many changes to my booking before the flight, I end up on a tiny regional jet with far less legroom and amenities than originally shown during booking.  After dealing with some app problems through the annoying customer service robot, I got to the airport.  After check-in I decided to upgrade to comfort plus.  Messaged customer support and was told it was no longer $19, but $650.  Eventually, we got back down to the $19 and I paid with a credit card.  I was told to have an agent reprint my ticket to show the upgrade.  Asked the gate agent to do so, but she refused, telling me it was too late.  I went to the ticket kiosk in DTW and received the same answer.  $19 stolen from me.  Got on and sat in economy.  Flight got a little bumpy and a teenage girl in the row in front of me vomits all over herself, the aisle, both seats around her, my bag under the seat, and part of my seat.  Smell is awful and I have never wished a plane would land faster in my life.  After landing, flight attendant provided no assistance in cleaning up and simply told the girl and her mother that passengers in rows behind would ""have to step over it"" in order to leave the aircraft.  I remind you this is during the pandemic.  A biohazard.  Nice, Delta.  Anyway, got off and went home, where I decided to try and get my $19 back.  After weeks of messaging and arguing with agents, my zero-interest loan was finally paid back.  Delta, next time you take my money and fail to provide me services in return, I WILL CHARGE INTEREST.  This flight sucked and I will seriously reconsider choosing Delta again after this.  Closing my SkyMiles account."
Date of travel: May 2020,50,Delta refunded my money for a trip I had to cancel because of Covid.,"I had purchased tickets from Delta to visit my brother in Idaho and tickets from United to go on our family vacation to Louisiana last May. I had to cancel both trips because of my employers travel policy due to covid that was not in place at the time of my purchase. Long story short Delta refunded my money, no hassle. I have been on the phone numerous times and have jumped through their request refund page and United will not budge on my refund. It doesn't qualify. Going forward I will be sure to fly Delta."
Date of travel: September 2020,20,Bad baggage policy,Recently flew with Delta and decided that they are overpriced and a rip off as far as baggage is concerned. I travelled international  inbound with 70lbs baggage allowance but Delta domestic baggage allowance is only 50lbs so I was told to reduce the weight or pay $130 for overweight. Very ridiculous policy - no wonder they can’t compete with other international airlines and are continually calling for the US government to restrict international airline competition. They do not want to hear passenger comments or suggestions so I will choose to avoid Delta Airlines at all cost for my future travels.
Date of travel: July 2020,10,DO NOT FLY DELTA EVER,"delta owes me 1400+ dollars. They ""refunded"" my request back in June but it shows refunded on some random credit card that isn't mine on the refund status. The representative basically told me that the website is wrong and it was refunded and blamed my credit card company. And said there is nothing more they can do and to contact my credit card. FYI alaska airlines refunded my trip due to covid in 2 weeks right in the heat of it. So unless you want your money stolen if there is another pandemic I HIGHLY recommend a different airline. They had no remorse either."
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Bad especially when airlines should reduce seats on their flights.,"Traveling from Aruba to New York , September 6 DL722Booked 3 months before my flight and took better seats and pay extra 60 dollars for each seat. Not only they with out apologize assigned regular seats in main cabin , their flight louder Stefanie only said oh, when we will be in NY you can go to Delta.com and see what company can do. I payed my money and they sell again my seat and put it somebody in front, I see this as discrimination.When our country will finish with discrimination??????"
Date of travel: September 2020,40,Vacation,"The service from Charlotte to Key West was great! We did have a very small layover in Atlanta going and coming back with no issues. The crew on all flights were welcoming, professional, thanked us for the business, and made safety their #1 priority. However, on our flight back from Key West to Atlanta (close to a 2 hour flight) the air did not work at all from the vents above you have control over. I tried all 3 since their was an open seat between me and my wife. It made it a pretty uncomfortable flight back with basically no air."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Comfortable Flight,"All in all, it was a comfortable flight. On the first leg from SJO to ATL, all food was only for sale, but is was also a good flight. On the second leg, there was a meal for free, which was in comparism to other airlines quite good. For all legs, an entertanment system was available. The check-in staff and the cabin staff was friendly and service orientated. All flights were in plan and we there were no problems."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Very dog friendly flight,I’ve previously had a horrific experience with Delta and didn’t think I’d fly with them again.That change when they were my best option of flying home on an international move.They were able to take a therapy dog from the US to Europe and they absolutely excelled in the process.At check in they were so friendly and helped secure a bag which was broken. They fussed over the dog and made us feel really relaxed about his first flight.KLM then carried us home to Amsterdam where they made sure we had a four seater row to ourselves so he had room. They allowed him to sleep on my lap and were complimentary and wonderful throughout. This is a Delta review but they are part of SkyTeam hence the KLM review as well.We’ll use them again for sure. Thanks!
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Not COVID safe!  Not spacing guests apart.  Filling planes.,We cancelled our tickets with another carrier and paid twice as much to fly Delta because they advertised that they had a policy of keeping an empty seat between passengers.  We selected our seats (an additional cost) to ensure we were distanced as much as possible.  On each of our flights we were reseated and they filled the plane all around us and even sat strangers in seats directly next to each other.  This is NOT what was advertised and not only do we feel misled and ripped off but we are uncomfortable with their disregard for their passengers.
Date of travel: August 2020,30,Booze Pushers,"Made reservation three weeks ago.  Told reservations agent on phone that I wanted to go first class, and I’d be paying for the economy fare with one card, then the difference for first class on another.  Was told by the reservations agent that as I was now a Silver Medallion member, that I was on the list for a complimentary upgrade to first class, so I should buy the economy fare ticket.  I will never make that mistake again!On day of flight, I never made it higher than seven out of twenty for a upgrade to First class, but I was upgraded to Comfort+.  That was nice, but I don’t often drink alcohol, so most of the upgrade was useless to me.  Why does Delta assume everyone drinks alcohol all the time?  They positively push alcohol in Comfort+?  Do they know something we don’t?  Is Comfort+ code for ‘get hammered on airline booze’?  I thought it was more leg room and better snack.  I was wrong.The aircraft was a 757-200(OW).  There were twenty seats in first class.  Instead of thinking a bit, the gate agent merely limited the seating in first class to ten (maybe that’s their policy).  However, this did not take into account that two of the people were husband and wife, and they sat in seats 3A & 3B.  As they presumably live together, they can share their germs and viruses.  Delta seats people in Comfort+ and in economy with a seat between them, but physically, this is almost as close as two people in first class would be, but I digress.  Seats 3C and 3D were empty.  They could easily have upgraded one more person to First Class or sold seat 3D and made a few more bucks while maintaining social distancing.  Delta is passing up cash here.  If they asked who’s married or who lives in same household among paying first class passengers, they could likely sell about one, maybe two more seats in first class on each flight and make a few bucks doing it.  I’d call this ‘intelligent social distancing.’I was in seat 15C.  The aircraft was boarded from the rear in accordance with row numbers, so unless I brought children, a wheelchair, or I was on active duty military any ‘priority’ boarding was out the window.  As such, I was literally the last person to board.  I was seated next to a young woman who almost immediately fell asleep and remained so for the much of the flight (could be important later).  I was handed a sanitizing wipe on entry, presumably so I could wipe down the surfaces near my seat.  I did so, and stowed my personal belongings.  Got out my noise cancelling headset and prepared for the long haul.  But I did keep looking at the lack of a passenger in 3D.  The chair looked like it would fit my ‘executive spread’ quite well.Reasonably on time take off at 1:09 p.m. (on my usually wrong watch).After take off, a flight attendant came through and handed out snack kits in Comfort+.  As near as I could tell, they consisted of a sealed plastic bag, with a bag of Cheez-It crackers, a bottle of water and perhaps something else.  She did not even look at me when passing these out, and passed me and my sleeping seat mate by.  I was never served a snack, or water on the flight.  It appeared that the flight attendant had begun handing them out from the back, and the one she gave to 15D was the last one in her tray.  As such, if this is how the staff always pass out the water and snacks, it seems the complimentary ‘upgrade’ to Comfort+ guarantees no snack and no water.  I did get a couple of inches of legroom, but no more than I would have gotten in economy at a bulkhead row.Lawrence, the male flight attendant working first class, did ask if I wanted beer or wine shortly after take off?  I don’t drink alcohol often, and certainly not before evening, so the answer was no.  But, again, some water would have been nice.  I’d even settle for a Diet Coke.The female flight attendant, the one who skipped me in the snack distribution, did come by a few minutes later to thank me for being a Silver Medallion member and to let me know if I needed anything, just to ask.  By then, it seemed obvious that they ran out of snack kits and water, as they didn’t bring more out.  So, to me, there seemed no need to ask for what they don’t have.  Good thing I spent $5.00 for a overpriced one ounce bag of cashews at the airport, as that was my snack for the flight.A few minutes later, the crew announced a complete in-flight reboot of the entertainment system (which gave me time to write this).  So, no movies or TV for about 20 minutes.  Unable to finish my movie during the flight.Got bored waiting for reboot, so I dozed off.  At about 2:03 p.m. (on the iPad) the flight attendant woke me from a pleasant and sound sleep to offer me free booze yet again.  They sure seem to think I’m a drunk!  Ugh!  I told her I don’t drink alcohol.  I’d kill for water, but none offered.  Really irritating, they don’t have what I do want, (water), but they insist on pushing alcohol on me (which delivers hangovers and dehydration) and they wake me up to do it.  Ugh!  Intensely irritating.No snack, no water for entire flight.  Not sure my loyalty to Delta has been worth it.  Maybe I’ll fly Alaska next time.  Definitely the bus of airlines.  Actually, that’s insulting to buses.  At least busses stop at truck stops where you can get some snacks and use the restroom.2:34 p.m., iPad time; first class offered a tray of lovely, chilled looking bottles of water!  Comfort+ not so much.  Tried to signal the flight attendant, and was ignored.  Guess we can just die of thirst.  Guess the crew had water all along, just not for steerage.I am debating my loyalty.  Empty first class row, lack of even basic amenities (water), defective WiFi, reservation agents who give bad advice, and COVID-19 used as excuse for reducing service levels to zero (save cash is real reason), pushing alcohol on those who are not interested, and even the low level of service on offer (water and small snack) is denied to me.  Why?  I showered today, I even combed my hair, so I’d look presentable, I wore a mask, and I don’t smell.    Well, Silver Medallion is meaningless, and service sucks.  But, they did get me here, and that’s what I paid for.  So, worth it?  Yes, because upgrade was free, but I won’t ever purchase a Comfort+ seat, as I don’t drink enough alcohol to make it worthwhile.  But again, my seat did not get here any slower than any other on plane, so I guess I’m whining about first world problems.  But, if the flight had been longer, I would have tackled the flight attendant in First Class for a bottle of water as I was really thirsty (flying dehydrates)."
Date of travel: July 2020,50,Perfect,"I've flown with several airlines but Delta is perfect price wise, comfort and ease of access to book!"
Date of travel: August 2020,40,Flight during Pandemic—surprisingly positive experience,"I flew in late July and early August with Delta and had a surprisingly pleasant experience. The usual amenities were present-mid flight snack bag, back of seat entertainment, headphones for anyone who needed them, ample leg room, etc. but if you’re like me and looking for a review on flying during a pandemic, look no further. With COVID cases in the US being up, our nerves were rattled from going back and forth deciding whether or not to take our pre-planned trip but we’re so glad we did. Every staff member at Delta, from the boarding agent to the flight attendants to the pilots were fantastic. We were given wipes to sanitize our seat areas and the overall appearance of the plane was very clean. Delta requires masks and the middle seats were all empty, making for a very comfortable flight."
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Delta Airlines - worst in customer service,"We had to go to San Diego for a wedding. We booked on Delta and purchased first class. We are well aware that airlines are requiring masks. We are well aware they are not serving meals or alcohol. We learned after getting on, they offer ""snack boxes"" and beer or wine in first class. Wonderful. They don't explain how you are supposed to wear a mask and enjoy the snack and drink they are giving you. I had my mask on until we were served. We ate and drank quietly. I did not get up except for one time about 30 minutes prior to landing to use the bathroom. While I was finishing my wine and reading quietly, the flight attendant came up to me, stood over me and told me I had to have a mask on, despite the fact that I hadn't finished my drink. I finished it and put my mask on for the remainder of the trip. After landing, I was promptly greeted by someone from Delta because I was reported for refusing to wear a mask. I was insulted and angry and told her to ""F*** off...I did nothing wrong."" She then informed me that I was now banned from flying Delta. What a great airline! A flight attendant gets upset because I didn't snap to attention when she tells me something, so I was reported and banned. You decide what airline you want to fly."
Date of travel: April 2020,50,Great customer service,Great way to service customer by extending credits till 2022 for the tickets we bought during pandemic. THank you Delta
Date of travel: September 2020,10,Worst Experience ever,Worst experience ever on a flight apart from me losing my flight front desk did absolutely nothing to help and just had the worst attitude ever. My method of payment had to be verified and they acted as if I was stealing someone’s credit card to pay a $200 flight. Customer rep lady was even worst at the matter.
Date of travel: August 2020,50,Great hospitality,Love that they are practicing social distancing . They were very pleasant great hospitality. I may switch my Flyer miles from Southwest to Delta
Date of travel: September 2020,50,Amazing Customer service!,"We are currently in between flights from Cleveland Ohio to Las Vegas. A young man for Delta at CLE named Adam was excellent!!! He went above an beyond to help us out when my husband and I were seated in different rows. Even though it technically wasn't his job, and would have been someone's at the next airport, he was able to fix our issue and we didn't even ask him to! He was so sweet and gracious,and I hope they promote him! Also the flights weren't over crowded and they are still social distancing. We will fly Delta from now on!"
Date of travel: August 2020,50,Flight attendant Patricia was amazing,"Thank you for the precautions DAL takes during this tough pandemic period. Patricia was a fantastic attendant through my flight 8/31/20 DAL 75. And, I left my Yeti tumbler on the flight and she found me in baggage to return it. I heard two other passengers speak highly of her service."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Accomadating and reasonable,"Accomadating and reasonable. Delta has always been accomadating on flights even when i had a dog, and later during the pandemic when we had to cancel our flight."
Date of travel: August 2020,10,10 hour travel time,"Abject failure from Delta. A 5 hour trip turns into 10 hours, and we're fed misinformation the whole way. Incompetence at every turn. Every single update was a problem. And as for your announcements, no one cares what altitude we're flying at, or how many pounds of fuel you're putting on. We have no frame of reference for any of it. Just shut up and fix it."
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Couldn’t get it up,"I fly to Florida about twice a month. During this covid lockdown flight schedules have been sporadic. I decided to fly delta because it would bring me in a little closer to my original destination. I own a business so it takes planning for me to take a few days off. Dog sitters, scheduling employees, etc.  I was looking forward to getting away. My flight was booked to leave on a Saturday. I arrived at the airport and the flight was delayed enough that I would never be able to catch the connection. A delta agent moved my flight to the following day. Day one of my vacation was gone but I thought no big deal. The next morning I get up at 5 am to make it to the airport in time to catch my second scheduled flight. We had a small delay boarding and got onto the plane. We sat for 45 minutes when we were asked to remove all our belongings off the plane. It seems a computer glitch in Minneapolis had caused the paperwork to get held up. Flight was never going to make my connection in Atlanta. Day 2 gone. When I asked for a simple refund the delta agent was rude and short with me. Not good.  I finally applied for a refund online but honestly I doubt I’ll get it. I will never use this airline again. In my opinion refunds should happen immediately when things like this happen. You shouldn’t have to wait a minimum of 30 days. In addition I was also charged a cancellation fee for my rental and I’ll need to give my dog sitter money. After all it wasn’t his fault and he could have booked another client. I ended up booking with Allegiant. A much more pleasant experience although I will have to drive an additional hour at least I will get there. Thanks for nothing Delta!"
Date of travel: June 2020,50,Thank you Delta!,Delta refunded me for the one time trip my granddaughter and I were going to take to Hawaii this summer and had to cancel due to the CV-19.  Very happy with Delta and will go with them when we are able to try again.
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Worst Airline Experience of my Life!,I walked into the Gainesville Airport at 5:30am for the first time ever. As I walk in I make eye contact with three people. One then turns around and walks into a door. I speak to the other two who are TSA and ask them where I get my boarding pass and they said that lady just walked away was the only one here with Delta and you will have to rebook now. Might I add that check-in is 30 minutes early and I made the initial eye contact at 32 minutes before flight. TSA wasn’t allow to go back and get her nor knock on the door. Might I add unlike large airports I was the only person in the entire airport and no flights where going out until noon so she knew I was there for her flight. I will never fly Delta again! I am now stuck in the airport for the next 7 hours.
Date of travel: August 2020,50,Delta is doing it right with Coronavirus,"I recently moved my daughter from Spokane to DC. We rented a van to move her stuff then I flew home. I was very nervous about flying at this time, but Delta is really doing everything possible to make it as safe as it can be. They are enforcing the masks (even with idiots who don’t want to wear The mask over their nose), keeping seats between passengers, providing wipes, and generally making sure if we have to fly we can do it with some semblance of safety. And we heard from employees that the company has their back about enforcing these things. Way to go, Delta!"
Date of travel: August 2020,50,Why Delta Airlines is the BEST,"Thank you @deltaairlines for making our trips so pleasant, at a very sad time in our family, we lost our beloved step-dad and grand-dad on Thursday 8/20/2020 in Orlando, Fl. @deltaairlines the customer service, the attention and compassion and amenities are truly unlike any other airline, but most of all I want to thank you @edbastian @deltaairlines for the amazing job in keeping us safe, the cleanliness is mind boggling, the sky clubs were perfect, and keeping middle seats closed, going far and beyond for your customers and their loved ones is what Delta Airlines does best, From AIH to ATL to MCO was one of many of the best trips we’ve had, thank you for the love, kindness and quality that only YOU ALL provide, These are just some of the values that makes Delta Airlines the BEST, we are forever grateful and Delta Airlines family members for life. Yours truly and loyal customers Luci, Craig and Jacob  #edbastian #deltaairlines #atlairport #aih #mco #unitedairlines #americanairlines"
n/a,50,"Delta is unflinching fantastic, every time.","So, these days, a person has quite a lot of choices when it comes to flying.I find, especially when flying 4< hours, you.may have to pay a bit more and it is always well worth the money.1. The Pilots are among the best in the business. On yesterday's flight, the Capt. was retiring after 37 years of service to Delta.That says a lot.to me! Its evident that Delta treats their people.well & they all have stock. Every single employee. That gives.employees ownership, rather than just employment & it shows. Almost an 8 hr flight. We were so comfortable that we slept for almost 4 hrs.2. They went to great efforts to make sure there was true social distance between the passengers. The entire flight, which was ""fully booked"" was about 40% empty & during this pandemic, it gave us solace.In today's world, excellent, seasoned pilots & airplanes that are modern & spacious are critical. They're going to be more expensive, but it could be life saving.We LOVE DELTA!"
Date of travel: August 2020,10,They hate veterans,a navy seal was banned. ALL veterans boycott Delta. LET this airline go bankrupt. Veterans have PTSD and it is challenging wearing a mask. Delta is not American. They kick veterans off. Do not support this airline
Date of travel: August 2020,50,Now is a GREAT time to fly,"Why is is a great time to fly?- great price- clean airplane, filtered and directed air- airplane is not cramped, lots of room- very helpful crew- everyone wears masks (while masks may not protect you, they protect others from YOU!)- no waiting lines at TSA- no waiting lines at check-in- no flight delays- no crowded airports (except Atlanta)This is like ""the old days"" of flying !FLY NOW, FLY DELTA!"
n/a,50,"Great, caring,  safe airlines","Delta airlines has gone above requirements to ensure a safe and on time trip.  We have had four trips in the past month and received friendly, kind service, especially at the Atlanta Airport.   This airlines does it all and does it right.   Thanks Delta."
Date of travel: August 2020,10,NO ENFORCEMENT OF MASK WEARING,"several passengers did not wear masks and each time a crew member reminded them to wear it, they would just take it off minutes afterwards. Crew members should have been more strict."
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Flight Attendant Refuses To Wear a Mask,"I flew from Detroit to Milwaukee Monday, August 17. The flight was slightly delayed and left at 9:00 p.m. I was in the first class cabin and could overhear a loud, inane conversation between the two flight attendants.  I leaned over to look into the galley and saw that one of the attendants had her mask pulled under her chin.She saw me and came over WITHOUT her mask pulled up to ask what I wanted.  I said that I would like her to pull her mask up over her nose. She smiled and shook her head.The irony!  Delta has a hit list of over 150 people who can’t fly Delta because of their refusal to wear a mask.  Get It together, Delta and stop with the stream of emails telling your passengers how safe they are."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,DON'T BOOK WITH DELTA,"I was denied entry into Canada May of 2020 (I paid for my return ticket home). In June of 2020, I booked a ticket through Delta with plans to be reunited with my wife in Canada. My flight plan was Chicago to Minneapolis, then Minneapolis to Calgary, Canada. Delta allowed me to fly out of O'hare, however upon reaching Minneapolis, I was told I wouldn't be allowed to board to Canada due to being previously denied.I was told Delta was supposed to contact me ahead of time to let me know, and I was also told I'd be given a full refund (I spent approximately $837). Fast forward to today, I received an email stating I'd only be given a $237 credit.Delta claims I was told before leaving O'hare that I wouldn't be allowed to board to Canada. Not only are they lying, but they completely abandoned me in Minneapolis.They had 2 weeks to contact me regarding my inability to board to Canada, and instead, they decided to lie about the entire incident. A billion dollar company refuses to refund my $800.DO NOT FLY WITH DELTA. AVOID BOOKING WITH THEM AT ALL COSTS.P.S. At the time of writing this, there is no information anywhere stating you'd be denied boarding if you've been previously denied."
Date of travel: August 2020,30,In between,Upon boarding the plane we were pleasantly greeted by the flight attendants. The pilot then started to ride slowly along the track and then stopped. A few minutes after stopping he then took off abruptly into the sky. The plane began to jerk and was very noisy. The ride was very rocky and the whole ride was turbulence never a dull moment. The plane ride reminded me of a roller coaster ride. Landing was awful as well he slammed to the ground and it felt very unsafe. The ride back into New York was much smoother and easier.
Date of travel: April 2020,10,Delta Choose Profits Over People,"I am disappointed that Delta places profits over the health of people. I booked a flight to Salt Lake City in Dec 2019 and planned to travel in April 2020. In March 2020 I rescheduled my flight to September 2020 hoping the pandemic would be better. Unfortunately it isn???t. It is actually WORSE than it was in April. I am not, nor are the people in my household, comfortable flying due to the pandemic. I tried to reschedule or receive a credit for my flight and was told the waive of fees/ travel credit was only for a 1 time rescheduling, which I already used in March. I don???t care about your cleaning protocols Delta, I AM NOT COMFORTABLE FLYING ON YOUR PLANS. YOU ARE HOLDING MY TICKET HOSTAGE. I either fly OR pay $200+ to change my flight to next year ( I will likely have to change it again resulting in me spending more money). Shame on you Delta for choosing money of people. Change for your policy NOW to continue waiving change fees for those who purchased tickets before the pandemic. Will you have the decency to contact me directly? Let???s find out."
Date of travel: August 2020,10,"Double charged for wifi, unhelpful staff, moved seating without notification.",Exactly as the title says they double charged me and refused to give me a refund for the wifi. I had to call customer care who gave me an email which was basically useless. When i boarded the plane trash bags were in the seat id been assigned and was told theyed made several rows completely unavailible without warning which i asked about and the lady essentially told me to do what ever and shed deal with it later. I had to ask another lady to help me find the seating changes which ended up causing a ton of confusion among the people boarding who were all the sudden having to swap seats because of the changes. The plane was also delayed by about an hour from initial take off. Compared d to every other airline Ive flown it comes in dead last.
Date of travel: May 2020,50,Impressed with pandemic safety measures,"Great flight. I watched pandemic updates in the news and from Delta religiously before deciding to fly back to our summer home. Delta staff made us feel safe and confident to fly. All the extra safety measures they took to disinfect between every flight, etc., were reassuring. We flew 1st class, but saw that spacing was also good in coach. Watching the news, it appeared other airlines were not  going the extra mile as Delta has. I will have no concerns flying Delta back to our winter home--provided they get the pandemic under control on the ground. Naturally, amenities have been cut, i.e. meals, for safety purposes."
Date of travel: August 2020,30,Gate Agent Creates Covid Concerns,"Gate agent made appropriately timed announcements re: boarding plan,  describing process. However, as we began boarding a bit later than planned, he apparently placed expediency above passenger safety, in that he called for ""Rows 14-29"" as an initial boarding group.  This resulted in a mass of people moving to the boarding area, congregating, not social distancing, and heading down a crowded jet ramp. The next call was for ""Rows 1-13"".This is in contrast to boarding smaller groups of passengers, which is what we encountered on all other segments of our trip. Flight went smoothly, with flight attendants doing typically fine job."
Date of travel: August 2020,50,Great Customer Service in this challenging time,"In the recent times when travelling comes with lot of anxiety and uncertainty, how passengers are attended to becomes all the more important especially when they are in a foreign country. In my recent experience with Delta Airlines for my parents return journey to India they experienced exceptional service and care provided by Delta in flight crew. Their flight attendant Nicole Johnson went way above and beyond her duty to help, support and guide them in taking care of all the forms needed for their forward journey to Paris. She helped them in filling all the forms while they were traveling from Phoenix to Detroit and also helped them on completing the remaining forms for their connecting flight by spending additional time with them at the airport. She gathered all the information and insured they have all the necessary documentation before their next flight. I am delighted by her service and would surely recommend Delta Airlines and Air France for great service and flexibility in this challenging time."
Date of travel: August 2020,50,Very Smooth except for one thing...,"Had a nice flight from Atlanta to DC. Was going home and had trouble getting my suitcase into the overhead bin. Asked flight attendant for help and was told they were not allowed to help...and that if I couldn't get my suitcase into the overhead bin because it was too heavy to lift, I should have checked it. I am 68 years old and not as strong as I used to be...so I was grateful when another passenger, a gentleman, helped me with my bag.Next time I will fly Southwest as sthey do not charge for a checked bag."
Date of travel: August 2020,20,First Class a Waste of Money,"Purchased first class tickets.  At booking Delta states there is no first class service between Rapid City and Salt Lake City.  The aircraft we flew on had first class seats and people were sitting in them, both ways. No food just cheap snacks and bottled water served in first class.  A simple sandwich would have been better than the unhealthy and cruddy snacks served.  Service was also negligible.   No reason not serve real food in first class.  Some restaurants in airports were serving food.  I see no difference in the serving a container of alcohol or soda over bottled water.  They all come in bottles.  Airline is using COVID19 to save money and cheat customers.   After booking Delta made numerous changes to seats and flight times.  I can understand flight time changes but seats that Delta stated were not available were empty  on our flight.  Row 1 seats are horrible in that there is more leg room in coach.  Row 1 probably would work for a child under 4 feet tall.   Delta charges extra to use Delta lounges for first class passengers.   Other airlines like American have no such additional charge.  Boarding and de-planing process went okay.  Delta is a cheap airline that cares little about passengers. On return flight video screens were inoperable.  Airline should refund partial ticket price.   Have flown Delta for many years and will never fly with them in the future."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,St Thomas stay at home ordered by governor starting 8/19/2020,I was down there for the first stay at home order back in April and Delta kept re booking me on flights that they knew were already cancelled. I ended up buying an AA ticket to get back home.
Date of travel: August 2020,10,"Flight was fine, customer service is terrible","I had to fly back home to help take care of my mom who was in the hospital nearly on her death bed. Given the current pandemic, I was only going to do a one way out and a one way back since I didn't know how long I would be here given my moms health. Delta toated they would wave a change of flight fee and have you pay the difference if I needed to change, so I bought a trip instead. As it turns out, I needed to stay longer. So I looked up how much a one way would be on the new day I wanted to fly out on and it said $145 ($25 more than the original flight i bought). I contacted them and they tried to claim that, after accounting for the difference, I would owe $288. I informed them of the flight i had found, and after some dispute, they offered me ""special deal"" where they would give it to me for the price I found. I accused them of false advertising and they refused to give me a refund for my flight, since the only reason I bought it in the first place was because they claimed I could change it and pay the difference of what the flight ACTUALLY costs.The price they needed to offer was the $145 minus the $120 of the original flight back. What I got was a selfish corperation trying to take advantage of an already hurting country by tricking them into thinking you are getting a good deal when you are being scammed. Their online app does the same thing. See my images below for reference.First image is the best flight price.Second image is other flight prices.Third image is the bullcrap price they try to charge you for changing it.My advice to anyone flying right now is skip Delta. Other airlines clean just as well as them and won't price gouge you.By the way, I decided to buy a one way flight with American for $50 instead of dealing with their bullcrap, and i suggest others do the same."
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Travelers BEWARE - You may be seated next to someone in spite of Delta Promise,"Delta Flyers beware! I recently drove with my daughter from Wisconsin to Durham NC to help her with the drive back to school. I was reluctant to fly back due to COVID 19, but when I learned about Delta's commitment to not place anyone in the seat next to you I , somewhat reluctantly, made a reservation and  paid extra to reserve my seats for the one way return flight home. I dutifully checked in on-line about 23 hours before departure and received my boarding passes for both legs of my flight.On the second leg of my trip from Detroit to MKE, Friday August 13th to my great surprise, there was a another passenger assigned to the seat next to me.In fact, he was assigned my seat and I was moved to the seat next to him. He was very apologetic and said he had no idea why this happened, but said he was informed of this as his pass was scanned as he was boarding(I was not!).  My row mate was not using a mask, but rather a polyester neck gaiter which was extremely disconcerting as I had just read an article of a study on various face coverings showing that these coverings were not very effective in limiting respiratory droplets getting aerosolized into the environment. I sent message to customer service while waiting for plane to take off (Friday 8:30PM) and have had no response as of Sunday 2:30 PM) Delta has broken my trust and I warn other travelers to beware. Mark  - DL3578 August  14, 2020 - Seat 17A (Moved to 17B)"
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Dorothy Burns,I hate everything about Delta Airlines! Terrible and incompetent stewardesses who barely understand or speak English.  Horrible customer service during the boarding process; and as I'm sitting here preparing for another crappy Delta journey; my seatbelt is malfunction and the stupid stewardess trying to tell me how to wear my seatbelt;this human was/is not listening. This is what I expect from a bunch of young stupid little girls. Expensive tickets and the worse service ever!
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Worst booking and customer service experience,"I booked tickets online on Delta website for my wife and myself. Somehow two tickets were issued on my name only.  I called Delta customer service and the only way to correct this error was to refund one ticket and repurchase again.  The service rep, Victor,  'did me a favor' by doing that and charging additional $200.  During the call I asked to speak to the manager but the rep flatly refused to transfer the call. The worst experience ever."
Date of travel: August 2020,50,Best airlines in Covid times,"I was very impressed with Delta for the painstaking and fantastic efforts this airlines took to make us feel safe in these uneasy times. They cleaned the plane to pristine standards, showed videos on how they were keeping us healthy and safe, offered masks, as well as a little bag with water, snacks, and hand sanitizers, not to mention extended a friendliness onboard to every passenger. Social distancing was observed and a middle seat was kept empty to ensure our safety. American Airlines, the carrier, we travelled on for our first leg of the trip packed us on the plane like cattle. So disappointing as we are a frequent flyers and so loyal to the airlines. Very disappointing. Delta airlines is without a doubt our new favorite carrier. I highly recommend!"
Date of travel: August 2020,10,attendance,"I missed my second flight to Brazil (DL105) because it delayed more than 2 hours. At the counter I was very poorly attended and treated. The Delta attendant tore my ticket without my authorization and to make matters worse he and my wife and I turned around to get a hotel, uber and meals, as it claimed that the company is not obliged to reimburse in cases of delay. I paid everything out of my pocket and had a business meeting in Brazil that I missed, because I had to reschedule another flight and only had the next day at night. My wife has severe Asthma and we were exposed for 24 hours due to the COVID problem, as our intention was to arrive as soon as possible in Brazil. It was the first and last time that I fly with this company, because I have a frequency to go to the United States 5 times a year, as I have companies and residence in Orlando. I will involve my Legal Department to activate this Company that has no respect for passengers. I will expose on social media this horrible service I received. I will never refer this company to anyone, because the least that this company could do is pay the expenses I had and simply ordered me to turn around. So now I will turn to justice and they will learn not to mistreat their customers."
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Boarding agent was rude,"I had a connecting flight leaving from Salt Lake City from gate C9. There are 6 C gates really close together and it was difficult to hear the boarding announcements and the Boarding agent was barely audible so everyone had to get close to hear (this is during COVID). When I walked up to scan my boarding pass he told he I had to consolidate my purse and personal item because I had too much stuff but I was following 5 women who all had a carry on, a tote, and a purse. While I consolidated my items he made fun of another passenger who didn’t know where to go and then he made a remark about me to passengers behind me after I passed the boarding station. It is very frustrating when the agents pick out specific people to scrutinize their luggage, especially on a connecting flight with the same airline. And it is extremely rude and unprofessional for the agents to make fun of passengers even if they do it behind their backs. This is the second time I’ve had a similar experience with Delta. Last time I let the “complementarily check my bag” the broke my luggage."
Date of travel: August 2020,50,Finally a safety conscious airline,I'm flying Delta Air Lines today.  I encourage everyone to use them.  The plane is only half full for distancing. Impeccably clean. They gave us sanitizing wipes for our seats and boarded back to front to limit contact.  Everyone is masked and extremely polite.  Hats off to Delta for taking our safety seriously.
Date of travel: April 2020,10,Luggage was damaged and i was never reimbursed.,"I flew from Atlanta to Toronto through Delta Airlines and one of my baggage showed up damaged. I asked at lest a reimbursement for and they promised by email they would do it but never did. Now i have no replies from Delta or any other person from there, i'm being ignored, that's it."
n/a,50,Amazing service/food and seats,"Can't talk about food,it was 100% for a long long flight, which honestly wasn't expected as per all others airlines and feedbacks,the staff were friendly and the seats were comfortable. There were many movies/music/meditative music."
Date of travel: May 2020,10,This Airline Is An Absolute Disgrace,"Delta cancelled my flight in April at the same time that American Airlines did. American refunded me within a matter of days. Four months later I am still chasing Delta with phone calls, letters and emails and being fobbed off left, right and centre. Hang your collective heads in shame Delta ~ I will never, ever book with you again. Look to American Airlines for guidance on true customer care. Oh, and by the way, this was a FIRST CLASS ticket I’m talking about. God only knows how they treat Economy customers."
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Terrible experience as always with Delta Airlines,"I survived 4 hours of harassment by the flight attendants on flight 787 with NY based crew. Me and my child were specifically targeted by flight attendant Amy and another male attendant. I have a minor child who has a medical condition preventing her from wearing a mask. According to Delta website minor children are exempt from masking requirement anyway. Notwithstanding I was told multiple time to disclose my child’s diagnosis or to put a mask on her. By the way other children in the plane did not have masks on. A male flight attendant was standing a foot away from my face and refused to step back after I told him that I do not feel safe. Moreover, after I decided to record names of those flight attendants a male attendant closed his name tag with his palm and told me that he will not tell me his name. This was my second and the last time flying with Delta Airlines. First time I flew with them they overbooked the flight from Las Vegas and I had to wait three days for a next flight. Shame on Delta!!!!"
Date of travel: June 2020,50,Efficient and Friendly Customer Service During Covid-19,"I have flown with Delta airlines and Northwest prior to the merger for many years both domestically and internationally.  I can honestly say that through the years they have been there when my travel plans have been altered due to family and travel emergencies.  Most recently, with the Covid Pandemic, I had to cancel a trip with friends to Egypt. Of all the contacts involved with my altered trip plans, Delta Airlines was the most efficient, effective and friendly.  My initial (and only necessary) contact was greeted by an actual person who not only solved my flight issues but gave me options.  I requested a refund as compared to a flight credit due to my unemployment status.  This was posted to my credit card account in less than 1 week, which was weeks ahead of the reported timeframe, which was a great relief and assistance to my ability to meet financial responsibilities.  I feel like many companies are hiding behind the facade of the pandemic to excuse themselves from providing quality customer service.  It is apparent that there are some companies, such as Delta Airlines, that truly took the necessary steps to provide what was necessary during these unforeseen times.  I also respect the fact that Delta is taking the necessary steps to provide a safe environment for current patrons that must fly as I did a few weeks ago.  I feel that Delta is truly taking safety seriously over profits, as demonstrated in part by not filling middle row seats on their planes as other airlines are doing.  I hope this company is rewarded in the future for taking the necessary and difficult steps during these challenging times."
Date of travel: August 2020,40,COVID time trip,"Aircraft was clean flight was safe everyone had masks on ,, i all have liked delta ,,, COVID taken seriously which is great"
Date of travel: August 2020,10,saddened!!,"VEEY DISAPPOINTED!!!! Even with the flight crew was extremely polite and professional, I was STUNNED & DISMAYED when arriving on board to be told that there were no drinks onboard and all I was able to have is water. What in the hell did I pay 1st class for if I'm going to be boarded last due to ""back of the plane"" numbering boarding and then when finally on board that I am only offered water to drink. This may very well be my last Delta flight. VERY DISAPPOINTED, SHAME ON YOU DELTA!!!"
Date of travel: August 2020,50,Great Airline to fly - Care for passengers safety during corona pandemic,"I took this flight and was uneasy at first since we are in the middle of a pandemic, but was really great to fly delta. Plane was clean, passengers spaced out, mask enforced, hand sanitizer handed out.  - info on how they protect passengers from COVID during travel. Before in waiting area every other seat blocked. I see there a lot care. Flight itself was Delta trademark and standard , friendly Delta service on board, great movie selection, clean plane, good food .... I truly recommend them. ( PS: during short Eu flight with KLM, spacing was not considered even though plane was nearly empty and steward announced you can not space out - what a different experience in the same Alliance)"
Date of travel: August 2020,10,"Delta changed flight without consent, the compensation is a joke","Delta failed to inform me of a flight change.  Only knew about it because my sister's flight was changed and she got an email.  Change in departure time resulted in us needing a hotel.  I used the Delta chat to try and change ticket but it took hours for anyone to respond and then when they did, they would close the chat after 1 minute.  We called and was told there were no other flights available that day or the next.  Any other day would have been during a work day so it was not acceptable.  My sister was offered 10k miles or $100. I was offered via Delta chat 5k miles, no cash refund, and via phone was offered 2k miles and $25.  None of these options covered the hotel or the fact that we had to leave a day early.Not to mention the representatives I chatted with tried to tell me I was the one inactive on the chat for hours (time stamps show opposite) and another said I didn't need a hotel, !? So frustrating.  Will be booking with anyone else next time."
Date of travel: August 2020,30,Great first flight but second awful flight!,First leg of my flight with Delta was excellent and they spaced us apart. The flight attendants were wonderful.  Second leg of the flight with Delta was a nightmare! A guy sitting directly behind me was coughing and blowing his nose. I requested to change seats and was told no that’s the red zone you have to pay more! No one was sitting there at all and this was a safety issue. My granddaughter and I who is a nurse were traveling home to take care of my 94 year old mother whose health has taken a turn for the worse. My granddaughter I were trying to take every precaution. The red zone seats were mostly empty. We were just trying to distance ourselves from a person who seemed ill. I even explained to the flight attendant about the passenger behind me.  I also noted the man had taken his mask down. I chose Delta because I thought they took Covid 19 serious and cared about the safety of their passengers. Obviously not on this flight! He could have offered to even move us to another set of seats towards the back of the plane. We would have taken any seat just to distance ourselves and there were plenty of empty seats! Then boards a woman with 4 children. They were put in red zone seats. That’s when things really go bad. The flight attendants were laughing and very friendly to with the woman and four children. That was fine but here was the problem and I was not the only one in the plane that felt uncomfortable. Throughout the entire flight and I am not exaggerating the children fought and cried and wouldn’t keep the masks on. Ok I get it they are  kids but the woman that was accompanying them kept standing up and pulling her mask down and yelling at the children. It was awful! She did make the statement that the children’s parents worked for the airline. She literally yelled at the kids almost the whole flight and the kids cried fussed and fought. When we all got off the plane I heard the woman arguing with the security about filling out the mandatory paperwork. I had clearance from the NYS health department due to the emergency with my mom. What an absolutely miserable flight and I felt so unsafe! The first flight I felt very safe but not this one!
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Worst experience ever,I had a horrible experience with DELTA I had 2 drinks at the airport let me go in the flight and sit down on my seat Then they  kicked me out due to “intoxication” which I wasn’t I didn’t bother anyone when I got on I wasn’t loud I started to fall asleep and they kicked me out they didn’t work with me to get another flight or a refund  I had to leave the same day because it was my sons bday the next day They didn’t give me a refund or a next flight  !!!PAOLA GUARDIOLA and her other coworkers was rude and nasty didn’t work with me or my friends didn’t give me a explanation I had to go to another airline Jet Blue and took it the same day and they had no complaints about me or said anything or felt any way of me being intoxicated Because I wasn’t
Date of travel: July 2020,50,Great Airline ,"We Love Delta Airlines, all their Employees are always very Friendly and Helpful.Especially Kimberly on Flight DL937 and Pablo at Cancún’s Airport check-in counter.Thanks again Delta for taking us safe and sound to our Trip to Mexico."
Date of travel: August 2020,10,Horrible customer service,"We were at first told our flight was delayed from slc to Minnesota but then they said it was going to be on time...we got on the plane and the pilot said we would be landing at 237pm in Minnesota but we landed at 2:50pm instead and the pilot said nothing about it, not even about landing at all. So once on the ground they said they had some fairway issues it would be a few til we got to the gate, 15 min passed and my plane to Columbus was already boarding...I literally sprinted almost passed out to get there to next gate which was miles away from the gate I was coming from...plane to cmh was to leave at 320 we got to the gate at 3:08pm and the lady shut the door on our faces ...said plane was gone..I said it was scheduled for 3:20pm its 3:08pm .I looked and it was not gone still there not moved.  She refused to allow us on it, and Then started screaming loudly get your mask on!! I was hyperventilating from running, my face on fire bright red yes I am out of shape( I just had a baby) I was in tears bc I just wanna see my kids been gone 5 days from them...there was no one else at the terminal gate so I didn't think it was a big deal to remove the mask to catch my breath a minute but to be screamed at about it is RIDICULOUS!! Jill was the person working at the door screaming...a manager came and was a total B**** too not apologetic not willing to help just said it was not her fault ... which yes that's true but you can be more sympathetic to your customers who have been traveling all damn day! We had to call delta and complain and they put us on a flight at 8pm so we have to wait 5 hrs in the airport. They only gave us 100 bux for this huge inconvenience...unacceptable...I would have been fine with nothing if people would have been kind about it and given some kind of explanation...never want to fly delta again! Customer service sucks!!"
Date of travel: August 2020,20,Wearing of Masks for COVID,"I chose Delta because of the safety record listed online for precautions taken. The ticket was more expensive, but the precautions were worth it...supposedly.What I was appalled to find is that many passengers pull the mask down so that it covers only their mouth or don't wear them. The flight attendants take the brunt of a passenger complaint about this. There should be an announcement at the beginning of the flight that the wearing of masks will be taken seriously and remind them what the consequences will be if they do not wear their masks OVER THEIR NOSE as well. Kids younger than 10 that are asymptomatic are known to be major spreaders and carry a high load of the virus.Everyone should be wearing a mask. It is critical that this is enforced. I have to fly to see my sick 84 year old mother  and go care for her. I hope that I have not risked my life and hers by traveling on an airline that does not enforce the wearing of masks. Please don't take this out on the flight attendants - stressful job, but DO have others help them enforce it. I will not favor American any more because of precautions taken, since it appears that mask wearing is not one of those precautions. At least it was every other seat."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,"We all love to complain about airlines, but....","I have used Delta for years (since they gobbled up the airline that I had a miles program with. They have never been less than competent in actual flight service and their customer service for bookings and changes is nothing short of spectacular. I have had several sticky flight booking/cancelling/changes over the years and they always, ALWAYS handle it with the utmost friendliness and professionalism. I literally created this account today right after getting off the phone with them. I had a big favor to ask, and they granted it in less than 3 minutes. It's weird to say I love an airline, because air travel is often just varying degrees of misery. But these folks are doing it right."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Emergency Help,"I regret not reviewing years ago; travel time/type of trip indicated isn't exact.  We had several family emergencies in Utah in the span of 2 years, and Delta's customer service was extremely helpful, even at the last minute. It is our airline of choice when flying within the continental US."
Date of travel: June 2020,50,Minor Program for Children,"Delta is by far the Best of the Best for sending younger children through the unattended minor program.  Services always outstanding, flights always within minutes of schedule and just could not ask for a better experience. GO DELTA!"
Date of travel: July 2020,40,Delta airlines customer service (800).305.6616 | Really helpful,"Delta airlines have amazing customer service [ 1.800.305.6616 ]! I had trouble while working with a third party company, but when I was able to reach Delta customer service helpdesk, one of their agents, Michelle, was extremely helpful and fixed all my issues! She was kind, patient, and very understanding."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Always bad,"Delta is just another awful American company that takes their customers for granted while circling the drain for years. I had to wait an hour at JFK in line just to drop off my bag. I checked myself in, got my own boarding pass and then had to wait in a line of 150 people just to hand them my luggage. They had only two agents working and one was tied up for 45 minutes with one couple. They just cant figure out the simple process of getting people into planes without it costing me, the customer, hours of time and aggravation. The employees were all good and professional, but they are set up by bad management to fail the passengers. How can Japan do what we are incapable of? Good management and respect for the customer, maybe try that, Delta CEO guy!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Delta 1 in the new Suites,"Was excited to fly in the new D1 suite,  heard so much about it and now was time to experience.  Firstly,  i am not a snob,  know flying in anything other than coach  is expensive and not everyone can afford.  That said, i have been lucky enough to fly in a few other airlines whom boast about suites and they should.  Delta on the other hand have a lot to live up to.  Now let me explain why...The good.....The SuiteIt gives you privacy,  if you want or need it.Staff are great as always and  i appreciate their hard work Delta is the only US airlines to offer a fully suite product. The bad......The suiteIts small and feels tight......The seat is the same,  though its like a box with a door....Flimsy door alsoJust didn't like it,  bring back the 747...only joking,  though kept the door open for the whole flight."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Delta 1 before Covid-19 changed everything,"This was the last flight I took in Delta 1  before all service was basically stopped.  At this point Covid-19 was beginning to cause challenges, though the only visible change was pre departure drinks were served in plastic and the after dinner ice cream was pre packed rather than the grand delta normal.   With the exception of this,  all was normaly for Delta 1 service."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,"Have cancelled our flight, not offered alternatives, and are not refunding us.","Delta have cancelled our flight, not offered alternatives, and are refusing to refund us. Not only that, but when we have attempted to get out £1000 back from them, through a chargeback with Amex, they disputed the chargeback over 60 days later, without informing us that they were going to, leaving us with £1000 of credit card debt."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,"Rude customer service, jokes about Covid19","Called to get refund on airline credit. Was told my house is more of a Covid19 danger than their airplane. Told them I cannot fly due to restrictions at work. Reply was ""so"". You have a credit use it. Asked if I use it and loose my job will Delta pay my salary? Reply was ""yes of course, if your going to ask rhetorical questions like that you going to get the same kind of answer""!  This is how this airline talks to people and cares about their customers. I do not ever recommend using Delta. I have just learned a very expensive lesson to never book with Delta Airline. I also see how they train their customer service employees to interact with the people that are keeping them in business."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Denied Entry,"I originally booked a ticket using Virgin Atlantic to fly directly to the Caribbean before the pandemic. Of course my flight was cancelled and I had to reschedule my ticket. Since Virgin Atlantic will not be flying to the Caribbean until October I was told to change my ticket  to use Delta and stop in Atlanta. I was reluctant since I've had bad experiences with delta but it was my only option outside of paying over 1,000 pounds to fly with another airline. I gave my details to the customer service at Delta and Virgin Atlantic and I was assured I will have no issues. On arriving at heathrow I was told that I have been refused entry to the US even though it was just for transit due to Us travel restrictions and I was told to get a direct flight. For one I was shocked nobody mentioned anything to me, and the US is a hundred times worse than the UK regarding coronavirus right now so the audacity of them to refuse UK entry i don't even want to go to that country. So Delta are crooks who're just looking to get money i will be posting the same review on Virgin Atlantic"
Date of travel: July 2020,50,"Great Job, Folks!","Delta means what it says about not packing their flights full, and trying to run at 60% occupancy.  Our flight was as full as practical, with every middle seat blocked. Obviously, the airline could have sold the rest of the seats, but they didn't, in keeping with their commitment to protecting their flying public.The staff observed every protocol, while remaining helpful and kind. When trying to locate the reading light button in the darkened cabin, I accidentally rang the call bell. The attendant who answered explained that the new design ""caused a lot of that!"" and turned on the light for me. I was delighted not to have been treated like an incompetent little old lady!"
Date of travel: July 2020,10,A truly awful customer service,"In February 2020 I booked a Delta flight to Italy through a travel agency. The flight was supposed to be in March, but it got cancelled because of the pandemic.After repeatedly calling Delta for about a month, I finally got someone on the line in April, who tells me that there is no problem in rescheduling a flight through Delta whenever I’d know which dates I’d travel. It’s June and I finally know when I can travel to Italy. After hours on the line, I finally reach Delta, but this time they tell me that I can’t book a flight with them since I bought a ticket through a travel agency. They say that I have to contact the travel agency asking for another flight or a refund. First contradiction.I try to reach out to the travel agency, but they don’t reply, so I fill out the forms asking for another flight or a refund. Days go by, and I don’t have any answer from the travel agency, so I call Delta, I explain the situation with the travel agency, and they tell me that there’s no problem at all actually, and that I can book a flight directly with them. Second contradiction. This is already quite convoluted, but at least I booked the flight I think.However, a couple of days later I receive a refund from the travel agency, and I later found that my booking has been canceled. I call Delta, and they tell me that the reservation has been canceled because, by issuing the refund, the travel agency itself canceled my reservation. I call the travel agency and they tell me they didn’t cancel my reservation, and that they don’t even have the power to do such a thing. I then call Delta again and they admit that it wasn’t the travel agency, but Delta that canceled the reservation because I got the refund. So what they previously told me about the travel agency cancelling the reservation was false (if not even a lie), and they rebooked my flight knowing that I would have it later canceled again by them.I explain the situation, telling them that I was first being told that I could reschedule the flight with Delta, then that it wasn’t possible, then they rescheduled the flight, then they canceled it. They tell me that I can’t expect to receive a refund from the travel agency and also reschedule the flight. I said that I wouldn’t have asked for the refund in the first place if I could have rescheduled the flight directly with Delta in the first place and that I’d gladly return the refund in order to reschedule the flight, given that now the price of my flight was three times higher. They tell me that this is not possible. I finally booked another flight... with another airline though.In conclusion, besides the endless waits on the phone, I received false, misleading and inconsistent information from Delta. The customer service has been truly awful. I’m shocked they treat customers this way, in particular given the current crisis in the aviation industry. If they want to scare away customers, that’s the most efficient way to do it."
Date of travel: July 2020,30,Long flight during COVID-19,"It started off good until I got to Atlanta.  While there the flight was delayed so long we had to move to another plane and gate.  Arriving in Amsterdam we were 3 hours late so the entire flight had to go to customer service to change flight.  They got me a flight 5 hours later which, of course they lost my bags.  If you are going to travel during these difficult time be prepared for some challenges. I took a Delta flight because American did not have any flight into Germany in a short period of time.  Oh and when you get to Europe the whole social distancing goes out the window, the plane was full-every seat taken!  Also, when you pay for a seat you expect to get that seat, not so.  They will change your seat to fit their needs not yours."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,"Poor customer service, treated an active duty service member very poorly.","I was PCS traveling-- on orders to my next duty station-- and I was stopping to visit family on the way.  I got to Seattle Tacoma airport 1 hour before my flight, and I used the automated kiosk to print my boarding pass. It gave me an error message, and when I tried to check 3 bags, it said a Delta agent would assist me shortly. So I waited 5-10 minutes, and when it was clear that no one was coming to help me, I got in line to talk to the agent behind the bag check terminal.  I told the lady there that I was active duty military, showed her my ID, and asked her to confirm that my boarding pass was TSA Precheck, because I knew it would get me through security much faster.  Since I didn't book the flight myself (it was booked through SATO), it turned out that they didn't put my DoD ID number in to ensure it was. Okay, that should have been an easy fix. However, the lady at the terminal took so long with the process that she said it was less than 40 minutes before the flight, and consequently it was too late to check my bags. She literally moved slower than a sloth. She then told me I needed to talk to a customer service agent at a different location. Well, at that point, any chance I had of making my flight was gone. The next woman I talked to behind the customer service desk said I had to rebook my flight, and that it would cost me $75. Then she told me that I had to pay to check my golf clubs, since it wasn't an essential item. I've flown hundreds of times, and at least two dozen of those instances were under military orders. I know perfectly well that when PCS traveling, the service member does not need to pay for checked bags. I told her so as diplomatically and cordially as I possibly could.  She was incredibly rude to me, and when I voiced a very constructive complaint that I should have had time to check my bags and catch my flight, she dismissed the entire thing and insinuated it was entirely my fault. Sure, I could have arrived earlier at the airport, but I have never been treated with such callous indifference before by airline staff.  It was as if asking for consideration based on the circumstances, particularly with how slow their customer service acted,  was out out of the question. The lack of customer support and understanding shown by those two agents makes me never want to fly with Delta again."
Date of travel: July 2020,50,Safest Flight Ever,"Delta has always been my airline of choice.  Even during delays and mishaps, they have never failed me. After being couped up for four months I really needed a break!I absolutely loved my COVID travel experience with Delta!!! For me it began at the check-in with a representative name Richard (Ontario, Ca.). So very helpful! Due to some having a fear of flying the airport was nice an empty. Once at the gate, I was advised that boarding will begin starting with rows from the back to the front. Upon entry of the aircraft, I was handed a hand wipe (Purex). I had my own of which I used to wipe down my seat, monitor, seat pocket, arm rest and tray table. The boarding process was quick, organized and easy. Only one flight, Ontario, Ca. to Atlantia did they not board from back to front. The rest of the flights boarded accordingly as I mentioned earlier. Shortly after the plane reached the desired altitude, snacks were served. First and business class passengers receivers snack boxes and all other classes received snack bags. There was no contact between the flight attendants and passengers. Everyone wore masks and ensured that my safety was their first priority. I love this airline!P.s. I would not splurge on a First Class ticket as you will still receive the same service and basically the SAME snacks a premium economy (First Class offers passengers the snack boxes that are normally $9 for passengers). I hope my review helped."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,The best economy class,"For me, it's the fairest service for an economy class. Fair price, good entertainment and a nice crew."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Never fly delta,"Delta is by far the worst airline. They failed in every way to handle a delay of their flights. First they were slow to update their flights so we had to sprint to the gate. Upon arriving at what should have been the last minute before the doors close, they informed everyone there was a 2 hour delay to the flight. When we then went to get dinner, I was again I formed last minute that the gate was boarding at that very moment. We then sprinted again to the gate only to find out it was now a different delay than before of around 30 mins. If I can help it I will never fly delta again and I suggest that no one else ever fly with this airline"
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Nothing as a big lie,"Delta like others promised for years, there plans are clean, air is filtered (HEPA), so why do we need face masks when it was clean before ?Either they lied 15 to 20 years in a row or they lie now. Service is now, a pice of sh.... Flight attendant running to the cabin up and down to remind everyone to put this bacteria soaked dangerous face mask for 8 hours over his Mouth. This is horrible and and prove this Airline, by the way like any other Airline, are Liars and just run with the political Media Propaganda Mainstream."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Wonderful,"Such a great flight!Nice cabin crew, new airplanes with good ife system. Arrived ahead of schedule!!!"
n/a,10,Bait and Switch,I purchased a first class ticket from Ft Lauderdale to Memphis. The reason I chose to pay for a first class ticket was to try to avoid getting sick. Boy could Delta care less!  They seated me in First class on the leg between Ft Lauderdale and Atlanta and denied me First class from Atlanta. This is a clear bait and switch. I clicked the button on First Class and paid more than 2x the coach fare. DO NOT FLY DELTA
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Great Delta One flight across the Pacific,"Very nice flight in Delta One on a Boeing 777.Ground services in Los Angeles were fine; the Delta lounge was fairly busy before the flight, but had suitable amenities including a buffet, self-service alcohol, and showers.  Due to crowding, there was a wait for the showers, but staff managed it well.  I would say that the Delta lounge experience does not compare well with the American lounge experience before this flight; on AA, passengers get access to a Flagship Lounge with less-crowded facilities and better food.On-board, the hard product was excellent.  This 777 featured the new Delta One suites, which are lie-flat and have a spacious layout with lots of storage.  Entertainment selection was extensive.On-board soft product was also good, with attentive flight attendants and plenty of food.  Meals were well-presented and tasty."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Very nice flight in Delta One,"SYD-LAX on a Boeing 777.  This aircraft featured the new Delta One suites.  The seats were excellent:  lie flat, doors for privacy, huge entertainment screens, and a ton of storage.   The design was thoughtful, with seat controls, etc. all being easy-to-navigate.  I appreciated that there were air vents above each seat.Amenities were great:  a well-stocked TUMI amenity kit and Westin bedding.Enjoyed the meals.  They were elegantly presented and tasty.  A tray of appetizers included marinated shrimps, an arugula salad with tomatoes and mozzarella, and a tasty soup.  The main course was a well-prepared fish.  Ice cream and cheese for dessert hit-the-spot.  The wine selection was not excellent, but was suitable.Service was attentive.  A very nice flight, overall."
Date of travel: July 2020,50,Excellent Airline,"Delta is hands down the best airline I've ever flown on. There are no frills, snacks/drinks are free and the customer service is phenomenal."
Date of travel: July 2020,50,WOW! Amazing Customer Service,"I have never been so impressed with an airline in my entire life! I had 23...yes 23 flights booked from March 15th to August 23rd of 2020. YES, 23 flights that needed to be canceled during covid. I had these flights booked on 15 different airlines. I have to say Delta is the ONLY airline from whom I received everything I needed to re-do the trips without a hassle, without long hold times and with polite, knowledgable employees who were not only helpful, but pleasant. I wish all airlines would handle the problems of these times with the excellent customer service of Delta. I assure you that in the future, whenever Delta is an option, that is the airline I will fly!If you are worried about booking a trip right now because we don't know what the future hold; to protect your finances and your sanity...I say go with Delta!"
Date of travel: July 2020,40,Flight was uneventful.  The way I like it.,Everyone was separated by a seat because of Corona.  So seating was comfortable and there were no delays.  Actually got to destination a little early.
Date of travel: July 2020,50,Doing everything right,"We were hesitant, to say the least, about traveling during the pandemic. But we're so glad we chose Delta. They did everything they said they were going to, safety wise, beginning with seating people well apart from each other--unless they were traveling as a family, of course. All of the attendants wore masks and (nicely) enforced the requirement that passengers wear them. They even handed out individually packaged snack bags for everyone with a Purell wipe, bottled water, and two snacks.This was a huge departure from what my parents experienced on American Airlines. They flew to the same destination we did at the same time, but their experience was very different. On both the way to and from our destination, they were packed in like sardines on the airplanes and not given any food or beverages, even for their hours-long flights. After comparing notes, my husband and I decided we'll get a Delta rewards card so we can fly exclusively with them in the future. My parents have vowed never to fly with American again, as they believe the airline put their health in great danger."
Date of travel: June 2020,50,Thank you Delta!,"Always a pleasure to fly with this airline. During these trying times, Delta has made a commitment to clean spaces and providing PPE supplies to customers. This promotes healthy and clean spaces for all. I appreciate this when I’m flying these days more than ever. They always have committed to keeping the middle seats open and that’s a huge relief!!! I will continue to fly Delta and recommend them to all travelers during COVID and beyond."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Beware of Vouchers,"Delta provided me with vouchers for my COVID-19 cancelation in February. When I used the vouchers to rebook my flight, they went ahead and charged my debit card anyway. I have a pending charge on my debit card for $400 for almost a week now. When I called to resolve the problem, the customer service representative tried to blame me, saying that I must have 'pressed submit twice' or made some other type of error. This of course is false. The charge listed at check out was $0. I was charged anyway. Beware."
Date of travel: July 2020,50,Stressed about flying during Covid,"Like many flying for the 1st time during Covid. Stressed about flying!  Was obvious for many.  Delta did make it easier and more comfortable  in flight and on the ground. Strong communication before, during and after take off. Middle seats all empty. 60% of plane was full. Sealed snacks packs only. Masks a must.  Seat order was called in groups of 5 not 10 or more. Way better!   Delta was on time, lift off a go, touchdown a go. Piece of cake w baggage. Less people makes it easier.  Smooth connections make Happy Trails ahead! Great job Team Delta Airlines. You made this passenger feel safer and you delieved on your end."
Date of travel: July 2020,20,Horrible customer service,"I know things had to change quite a bit due to COVID-19, but let me give Delta an example of what happens when they cancel or move flight times by even just a few hours:Booked a great price on a round-trip several months in advance (during Covid) to fly to the southern states in mid July 2020.  Got flight, paid for it, credit card was charged. I booked my rental car, set up my itinerary, booked hotels, etc.  A few weeks before my vacation, Delta sends me a notice they have changed my flight leaving time from 6am to 1pm with a 2 hour layover in a connecting flight.  With time change and all, I am now getting to my destination not at 2pm Eastern time as scheduled, but at 11pm.  I just lost half a day. Rental car place at airport closes at 9PM. I will be eating dinner in an airport, not at the restaurant I made reservations at. Ill have to catch a cab and wont get to my hotel until almost midnight.  That's $160 just to sleep in a bed, no gym, no bar, no relaxing at the pool that day. A day of vacation gone.Next day, instead of being on the road in my rental car nice and early, I have to wait for the rental car place closest to the hotel to open, pay for a ride there, get the car, etc (2 hours wasted).  I then have to pay a $50 ""one-way"" return fee to drop it off at the airport I SHOULD have been able to rent it from in the first place.Now, I tried to avoid all this by changing my flight with Delta, but I couldn't.  I log in online to my account and it says I have to make the changes by calling customer service.  I call customer service and it says that due to the volume of calls, they can't help me and to go online to my account (!).  THEN, the line hangs up on you! I tried for 3 weeks to change the flight, cancel it for another airline, etc, but I had no guarantee that even with Covid (the reason I assume they re-did all the flights due to cancellations, etc) that Delta would refund my cash vs offering me a voucher for another flight another time (no thank you).  Not being available to help your customers is horrible.  Even my complaint to them directly (aknowledged via email) has not been addressed and it has been over a month.I do like the free movies and the video screens on the seats/phone chargers.  For that they get 5 stars.  Having the middle seat empty (Covid) was fantastic.  Thats it.Oh and HEY.  Airlines started charging $30 for checked luggage in 2008 because of ""high jet fuel prices"".  Why are we still getting charged for a checked bag?  SCAM."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Delta lies and refuses to address the lie they created.,"We had booked a round-trip First Class ticket from LAX to Puerto Vallarta for the 4th of July, 2020.  When we went to the airport in Puerto Vallarta, to return back to Los Angeles, the Delta counter informed us that we were no longer allowed on Delta but could not tell us why.  We spent 6 hours getting ready for departure, tax to airport, waiting at airport to find out that the gate people at Delta could only tell us that we were not allowed on the flight but not why and to call corporate, which we did and got nowhere because it disconnected after being on the phone for 2 hours and then later, Delta said you have called too many times and if you call again, you will be barred from Delta for life.  All they could come up with was that we did not wear our mask from LAX to Puerto Vallarta but we did, we had on our face during the flight and no-one ever approached us saying anything.We never received an email from Delta telling us that our return flight was cancelled and don't bother going to the airport in Puerto Vallarta because we won't let you on.  They also claimed later that after I called from the airport, they sent another email and said to check my spam, which of course I had done multiple times and no email ever.  We had to buy another flight home on American and spend money for 2 hotel nights.I asked for this report of details about this flight from LAX to Puerto Vallarta and was it a flight attendant or passenger because this has to be mistaken identity and they said if I continue to ask the same question for the details, they will put us on the list for our lifetime."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Broken equipment due to Delta negligence.,"Thanks Delta, for reminding me that my pockets are not deep enough for you all to care how me or my property is treated. I've been lied to, witnessed a clear violation of how things are supposed to be handled, and I've been ghosted.Some backstory: relocating as a remote worker. I packed my work equipment with multiple layers of bubble wrap and clothing, put them into a box, and sealed it with guerilla tape.I checked my box as an oversized special item to prevent any mishandling. The lady at the counter marked the box as fragile and oversized. She then told me that I could claim the item in a designated area as it would not drop down the conveyor belt.She then asked me to sign away all liability saying that they'll take REASONABLE care of my property but aren't liable for damages.Well, Delta's definition of reasonable care means that they'll stack boxes on top of a box marked fragile, send it over to standard baggage claim tumbling down the conveyor belt, bend the box(how?), Then the coup de grâce, puncture the box and it's content...So I see the box tumbling down the conveyor belt and I'm dmbfounded... This is not what was discussed. Its about to flip over the sides since it tumbled end over end but luckily It caught balance and landed with a thump back onto the belt.I go to the counter to explain to the lady who's clearly annoyed, what happened to my box. She asked me to test if everything in there works. I couldn't find the wires for the monitors and we ended up speaking to Scott Winters of LAX. I pointed out every bend and hole on the box saying, this isn't reasonable care.After seeing the box Scott said I can go home to buy wires and test the monitors within 24hrs, email him and then we'll work something out if it's broken. I'm guessing this was to just get me out of the airport because he later ghosted me.The next morning I got some new wires and plugged in my BenQ which worked fine. I then unwrap my dell 27"" ultrasharp ips monitor and see what appears to be a hole that's penetrated the first two layers of the screen.Naive and hopeful, I plug in the monitor thinking that it'll still work and if it's just a scratch then I can live with that. But after plugging it in That scratch started to look more like fractures as the screen begin to illuminate. It was done.I called Delta's help support number, when I finally got through to someone I barely got out half a sentence before being interrupted. The gentleman proceeded to interrupt me a few more times until I finally got my story out and after a final interruption I just hung up.I emailed Scott to update him on the progress I had made, I also sent a message via Facebook messenger to Delta to figure out how to actually put a claim in for the issue. Scott replied back thanking me for keeping him in the loop.I finally got a ticket submitted and within an hour someone had already denied my claim. I cc Scott on the email asking them to make things right. They offer me $250 travel coupon. I absolutely decline and you can remove it from my account then remove my account.I send another message to Scott, he was friendly so I'm sure he'd be willing to help, nope. He ghosted me.I've made quite a few trips with Delta in the past for work and I religiously chose them because of their seating space and how easy it is to check in. No more. I'd rather fly spirit. You all really showed how much you value the 9-5 regular Joe. I bet if I was a frequent first class passenger you all would have been way more hepful and and remorseful for your clear negligence of handling and someone else's property."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Mistaken identity,"We had booked a round-trip ticket from LAX to Puerto Vallarta and when we went to the airport to return back to Los Angeles, they informed us that we were no longer allowed on Delta but could not tell us why.  We spent four hours on the phone trying to figure out what was going on and all they could come up with was that we did not wear our mask which we had on our face during the flight and there is doing notice given to us via email that they were not allowing us on the flight and there was dumb and noticed give it to us on the flight of any altercation"
Date of travel: May 2020,50,Fabulous flights and customer service,"During march-april I had an unfortunate 6 flight cancellations due to the Coronavirus pandemic. We called up with my flight reservation number, and each time they found me a suitable alternative. Not at all their fault these flights kept being cancelled! People on the phone were friendly, helpful and professional and couldn't thank them enough for keeping me calm and informed. Didn't cost me a penny to make all of these changes, and I even booked 1 week before departure, then moved it up to next day with no fee(due to COVID-19) so I paid a VERY good price, cheaper than that of the cheapest economy airlines for a next day flight! The flights themselves(had 2 with a connection) went smoothly and great. Cheap seat upgrade last minute into comfort+($40 for a 7 hour flight.) Food and onboard services were fantastic. Flight attendants were polite and friendly! Very clean and well looked after aircraft. I aim to always book through Delta, on Delta flights wherever possible multiple times a year!"
Date of travel: August 2019,50,One of the best economy class products,"Delta has one of the best economy class products around. A lot of attention is placed on the details - I got an amenity kit, pair of slippers, Evian water etc. Michelin star food was also served on my flight to Tokyo."
Date of travel: May 2020,10,Financial troubles means refunds are not forthcoming,"I booked a 5/28/20 single day R/T from SJC-LAX for a mid-morning business meeting.  My original itinerary was out at 0700 and return at 2030, for a 1100 meeting.On 5/26/20 Delta flat-out cancelled the 0700 outbound flight.  They rebooked me for a 1730 outbound flight.  This would have forced me to miss my 1100 meeting.  I cancelled my reservation and requested a complete refund on 5/26/20,  case #03661946.Though I received an auto-reply, Delta NEVER further responded to my refund request.  The terms of carriage state that you're entitled to a complete refund (even on a non-refundable ticket), when the airline cancels the flight for reasons other than weather delays.NEVER AGAIN.  Delta is a rip-off.  They will abuse consumer rights and ignore requests.I had to contest the charges with my credit card company, who promptly issued a complete refund."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Terrible customer service and no call back feature,"Arranging this trip before the covid 19 virus was worrysome, the first time i reached out to Delta to rearrange my flight it was done without issue, but the second time they pretended that i didn't pay for my seats originally and charged me hundreds of dollars extra. Speaking to the supervisor was even more frustrating (3 hour phone call) she used every tactic she could, talking over me constantly when i was trying to explain what was wrong and when i wasn't talking just kept saying ""you have to let me talk you have to let me talk you have to let me talk like a 4 year old. She also used another call tactic where she would be absolutely silent for 20 seconds hoping i'd hang up on her. They finally refunded me in ""credits"" but only after charging me some more. Don't fly delta."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Delta Comfort Plus Option,"I really thought the comfort + option was worth the price.  Excellent leg room, great movie screens, premium snacks and ear buds, great luggage compartments, preferred boarding,  etc were worth the additional cost!"
Date of travel: July 2020,50,Amazing!!!,I have been flying Delta since 2 years ago and I am very proud of then. After flying other airlines I can say this airline cares about the health of their customers and employees.Amazing experience during this crazy times!!!
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Delta - Now last in customer service!,"4 days before a vacation flight to Cabo, Delta informs me that the return flight has been rescheduled to the next day. Delta will not compensate for the extra night of hotel required, the extra day of rental car required, the extra day of parking required.I asked for the return to be switched to a different airline on the original departure, and Delta refused. The only option I was offered was to request a refund for a vacation that had been planned for months (tickets were purchased in Feb), or accept the later departure date at my cost for the extra hotel night and other costs.I have flown in the past for business internationally on Delta, and for a few hundred dollars, they will now lose tens of thousands of future international flights due to a change in schedule that Delta is imposing.Delta is no longer an airline of choice. They display no loyalty to their customer base, and feel free to impose changes without compensation."
Date of travel: June 2020,50,Super Impressed ,"We flew June 27th from Pittsburg to Atlanta to Fort Myers. Then back home July 4th. Everyone from baggage claim, pilots, stewardesses, they were all so amazing, helpful and kind! The flights were fantastic. Would definitely fly Delta again"
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Refused flight after booking months in advance,I was discriminated against! Refused access to flight and cops were called when i insisted on a refund! Which I have never gotten!
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Do not fly with these idiots.,"Do not use delta. They change your flights last minute and have no customer service, then rob you of your money when you can not make the flight they changed on you."
Date of travel: July 2020,50,Thank you Delta,"Delta did an amazing job on our flight.  It was only about 50% full.  They kept the middle seats open unless like us you were flying with your family.  Our son sat in the middle seat.   As you board they give you a Purell wipe for your seat.  They advised everyone to wear a mask and would not pull away from the gate until everyone did.   During the flight they give you a bag with water, purell, and snacks.   We did not eat on the plane as you would have to take off your mask to do so...  During the flight they asked people to keep their masks on.   I felt safe and comfortable."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,Logistics anyone? No gate agents no pilots no one at the wheel,"Do not fly Delta they do not have agents at the gates 30 people missed their connecting flight because no one was at the airport to open the door, flights are circling in the air and running out of gas reverting to other airports just for gas, now a day later 15 hours in (3 hours of in air time) we are trying to find a second pilot in the airport lounge so the plane can take off. Please someone that knows anything about logistics please save this nightmare delta."
Date of travel: April 2020,10,Poor Customer Service,"I was supposed to fly from SMF to LIH with Delta at the end of April 2020. Unfortunately, due to COVID-19 I relized this was likely not going to happen. I received an email from Delta a few weeks prior to my flight that one leg of the flight was canceled. I attempted to contact Delta immediatley after this to cancel the remaining portions of the flight, as I was no longer able to get to LIH with the flights I had purchased. I was unable to reach anyone from Delta due to ""high call volumes"". I attemped to cancel the flight from Delta.com, but was directed to come back within 72 hours of the flight leaving. I attempted to cancel my flight dozens of times within the 72 hour period, and had no luck. Finally, minutes before the flight was scheduled to leave I was able to cancel. I recieved an email from Delta saying that the card used to purchase the ticket would be refunded the full amount, and that it could take one biling cycle to see the credit. After one billing cycle the credit was still not issued to my account, so I reached back out to Delta. I was told by the Delta representative that they would have to open a dispute case (even though I sent her the email that Delta sent me saying the amount would be refunded). After zero luck working with Delta I openeded a dispute with my credit card company. They have been attemping to work with Delta for over a month now. Delta told the credit card company that the ticket was exchanged for an alternate ticket (which is untrue). I am extremely dissapointed in Delta's handling of this, and have heard the same story from many other people who have had issues with canceled Delta flights due to COVID-19."
Date of travel: July 2020,10,R kelly sheets,The plane smelt like piss the desk was rude as h3ll they told the guy who was paying for my bags to leave if he wasn’t flying that I’m old enough to take care of myself ended almost missing my flight trying to get my bags paid for cause of this delta pleb! DURING A PANDEMIC YOUR PLANE SHOULDNT SMELL LIKE PISS I WAS GAGING THE WHOLE TIME WITH MY MANDATORY MASK TRAPPING THE SCENT! And treat your customers with RESPECT not like CATTLE!
Date of travel: June 2020,40,Dutiful Delta,The plane was clean and on time. each middle seat was empty. Masks were required. TV on back of each seat. Free ear phones. Boarding was great. No confusion or rush getting off the plane. Snacks and bottled water were handed out.
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Cancelled my flight last minute and didn't contact me,"If I hadn't contacted Delta I wouldn't have known my flight was cancelled. No help in re-booking the flight either. Resulted in my spending $1,400 for a United flight."
Date of travel: June 2020,50,The planes are clean!,Flew two leg trip round trip from BHM to LAX via ATL. All the four aircraft we flew were clean and the crew and gate agents maintained a positive environment. All the aircraft had obvious ventilation upgrades. Visited Sky Clubs in LAX and ATL which have limited but adequate food and beverage service. Terminals are also clean.
Date of travel: June 2020,40,Mask Policy Not Enforced,"I am leaving 4 stars bc the delta crew was absolutely wonderful, taking every precaution possible for COVID. The flight was flawless. Bagged water snacks and sanitizer. My one concern is that people were not wearing masks right across from us and nothing was ever said to them. This counteracts the hard work Delta is taking to protect us."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,The worst airline ever!!,"They just literally ruined the one and only trip that we did not have to cancel this year yet, due to the Pandemic. We had a trip planned in August (direct flight both ways). Which we know it costs a lot more than connecting flights.....All of a sudden, we received an email that both flights are now connecting flights, and each has 4-5 hours lay-over in a different state. Seriously?!?! This is NOT okay! Especially, during this pandemic! Why do we have to spend hours each way in another airport?!?So, we have to worry about taking 4 different planes, instead of two!!! Sanitizing and cleaning 4 planes instead of two!! And, how about the fact that waiting 4-5 hours each way in an airport full of ppl!! How is this safe for their travelers?!?!? How is this right?!?! They do not value their customers or their time!!This whole thing is NOT safe!!"
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Very terrible,Delta airlines is not good they just let my cancelation flight expire and no help to customer service at all.just wasting my money purchasing in Delta.they don't care about having trouble or issues for covic 19.mine and my daughter flight is get expire and no refunds no nice customer service.very rude people
Date of travel: June 2020,50,Kind Response in the Midst of Awful Odds,"My wife and I were going to fly to London in August but we wanted to cancel.Delta was kind and amazing to respond and refund our flight, so we would be able to make ends meet during the pandemic.We are excited to fly with them again as I have done in the past."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Family kicked off plane,I just watched a video of a family that was kicked off your plane after purchasing the seats they were occupying bc there was a baby in a car seat....did they get a refund? I sure hope so! I’d never use your airline simply bc of how this situation was handled. Absurd and shame on you all!
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Unable To speak to a person,This is the second time Delta will not answer telephone . They did have call back and then they never called or called days later. They now just hang up on you .
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Delta not answering phone. ,"I am a loyal Delta flyer.  Frequent flyer member, credit card holder and even actually pay for first class on occasion.  It is still the best option for me to fly to Panama City, Florida from Chicago.  I have an itinerary that I can’t even figure out.  I don’t think I have a connection. My flight is in 6 days.  No one answered the phone.  No one answers the texts.  I’ve called 11 times today so far.  No hold option. Just told to call back.   I need to know if I am going or not!!!   No one answering????    I thought a retailer recently was bad putting me on hold for an hour 4 times.  I forgive you!"
Date of travel: March 2020,20,Patience is needed when trying to contact Delta,"Since Delta is not beginning daily direct flights from BOS to BDA until 9/1  our August 31st flight was changed to stopping in ATL.. This did not work for us. We were able to change our hotel dates and... then the big wait began to try to contact Delta since we were unable to make our changes online.I tried at least 10 times at various times of day/night to finally be told that I would get a call back. Instead of the 30 minutes it was an hour later.  Understandably not everyone has the time to invest in calling and waiting. After all this, we are not even sure we would be comfortable traveling yet, but at least we have flights that we want."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Currently on hold for 3 hours and 40 minutes straight,I incorrectly booked myself twice on the same flight from Baltimore to Atlanta instead of myself and my daughter. Only way to make a switch is through a phone call. I’ve now been on the phone straight for three hours and 40 minutes.
Date of travel: June 2020,10,reservation nightmare,"Booked a flight with Delta, they modified my connecting flight without calling me, then after 40 or so calling attempts (they continuously hang up due to call volumes) was able to rebook, only to have it cancelled by Delta 2 weeks later.  After requesting a refund, instead of giving me my money they booked me on another flight with 3 layovers and on a different date without asking or calling me, i also received no email/itinerary and i discovered it only because i happened to check my skymiles account."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Customer Care Sucks,I wanted to change/modify my flights to sydney and tried to call customer care center but when ever I'm calling I'm getting the same message that if it is not urgent pls call later. How can I plan my other things if my flight is not confirmed. I even tried their Message Us service. Every 2 hours I'm getting a message stating that they are busy and I still want their service. If say Yes again after 2 hrs I'm getting the same message. I can understand this unprecedented times but that doesn't mean that I should stick to my plan.  Why the hell they can't recruit more people if it is too busy. Being a big company Delta should not provide this worst customer service.
Date of travel: June 2020,50,Flight experience,Took flight from O’Hare to Lga last week. Awesome arrangement. No one is sitting near u and hand sanitizers were given .  Felt so safe while flying with delta . Thank you
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Do ya feel lucky?,"This company canceled my minor child’s direct flight. They rerouted him. Their website experience: “oops, we are unable to process your request. Call 1-800-“Their call center experience: “due to unusually high call volumes, we are unable to take your call.”  They disconnect. Their messaging center experience: every 2-3h from the moment I messaged them upon awakening until I fell asleep they sent a message asking if I still needed help. Once I fell asleep, they cancelled me request due to “inactivity”. If they don’t have time to talk with their customers they shouldn’t take people’s money."
Date of travel: June 2020,40,Very good flight during this 'turmoil' period,"Distancing during the flight was well respected as the middle seat on the two aisles of the Airbus 321 were left empty by Delta. Since no food or beverage were offered, flight attendants distributed small plastic bags containing water, some snacks and hand sanitizer. The crew and all passengers were wearing masks. The only issue was on desembarkation as plenty of passengers did not respect distances and were, as usual, quick to wanting to get out. Even though the crew had clearly mentioned to respect the 6ft (2m) distance when exiting.Overall pleasant flight with a very good audio/ movie system."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Zero Customer Service,"So my flight is canceled- I get that- but where are my ecredits , and my frequent flier miles? Since there is absolutely NO way to reach them - NO WAY- I have no idea. How can a huge business simply not be available at all. Epic fail! I encourage everyone to give them the bad review they have earned!"
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Delta Doesn't Care,"Everytime I have flown Delta has been horrible but this time it was the worst. My wife, me and our 6 month old daughter are traveling and when Delta rerouted us to Houston on our way to Dallas they decide to put everyone in a flea bag hotel. Delta staff is rude to my wife and I. It is 1:30am and I am writing this review from this dump of a motel they put us in and we had to pay our cab fare. On top of it they broke my wifes bag, again. Delta sucks."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Cancelled flight,"I taped my latest call to the Delta 800 number and received the ff message.  l"" Please wait for the next avail agent, the current wait time is 6 hours and 47 minutes"" I'm paraphrasing but the time is accurate!"
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Johnny Aragon,Had flight for mother's funeral and they arrived late causing next flight to be canceled in Atlanta  which means I had to stay the night and pay my own hotel stay due to there late arrival
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Worst Booking Experience,"I had a flight booked about 1.5  month ago, from houston to Harrisburg PA, and just 6 days before Delta emailed me ,asking to get it rescheduled.  I tried without success to book another flight on Delta airlines website because no fly available. I couldn't scheduled outside of my time frame since I was flying for my Son Surgery .I then ask Delta to refund me to book with another Airlines , No response to my 3 emails and Complaint filled out.and the worst I couldn't reach anyone by phone , chat or email.I finally drove 3000 miles round trip to get there because it was too expensive for me to book in that short period of time.I STRONGLY DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS AIRLINES."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Delta canceled flight and did not notify us,"I booked flights for my husband and I from MCO to STX.  I noticed our flights were re-routed (no notification from Delta) and I paid for Delta Comfort and they had me in regular economy so I called Delta.  The agent was great and fix the seating issue and put us together in a row with a seat empty in the middle since they are not booking middle seats. On 6/17, I was looking at our flights and couldn't pull his up.  The system kept erroring out, so I called Delta.  Four hours later they called me back.  After over an hour later, Delta confirmed the system canceled the flight.  I asked why and they said it was because it was overbooked.  I asked why was his canceled when we had seat assignments and had a middle seat open so this didn't make sense to me. I then asked if it was because his flight was booked with points and they said that had nothing to do with it. I never received an answer as to why him.  The worst part was they would not rebook his flight because it was overbooked.  Delta is refunding monies and points but I then had to go book on another airline and pay more money."
Date of travel: April 2020,10,Flight was canceled and now all info disappeared on Delta,"I hate to have to do this but my flight to Belize was canceled in April, understandably so but I was told I’d be able to use the e-credits,etc. well, it’s now almost 3 months since delta canceled my flight and my e-credits are nowhere to be found and what’s worse is when I went to request a refund and have been using messenger for assistance, all the info has disappeared! Reservation #, ticket #, and confirmation # are gone as if I never booked it.  I’ve been trying to call for 2 months now and am unable to get through.  I actually had to book my next trip with ANOTHER airline because delta is ramping up their price and I was not about to give them more money in the event this happens again.I’m extremely disappointed in Delta and when business travel does ramp up again, will certainly be changing my airline of choice/loyalty program.  And I am one that travels a lot of work.Good thing I have the email with trip confirmation AND cancellation and screenshots of my bank statement. It seems like there’s some scamming going on and I will not stop until I get my full refund (no e-credits since I won’t be flying with them again)."
Date of travel: May 2020,10,Lost our reservation & ZERO customer service,"Booked a (nonrefundable) flight to Japan for May 2020. I am sure you can guess how that worked out. Was able to cancel with full credit no fees in April. Appreciated that. Despite all the information on the website and in emails saying I can rebook online, that was wrong. I had to call. I waited on hold about an hour, which is fine. I got us rebooked for March 2021. I was then put on hold so I could speak to customer service to get a refund of the remainder of our credit. I hung up after 2 hours. I went to my Delta Skymiles account, saw our flights, even picked our seats. My mistake was not taking a screenshot, but who expects their flight to DISAPPEAR?Two months later, it's gone. All of it. NO flight, no credit, no documentation (they never sent an email). And I cannot get a hold of anyone in customer service just dead end recordings. Research online shows customer service is nonexistent. I am a patient person. But I am not ""nothing for 3800 dollars"" patient. Will never book with them again. I can handle hassles, but I can't recommend a company that is not accountable with peoples money."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Flight cancelled without being told,"I was flying to the Florida Keys to see some family. A few days prior to me flying out, I tried accessing my ticket. It would not come up, so I tried calling multiple times & was not able to reach anyone. The day before my flight, I receive an email saying “hope to see you at 11:25”, when my flight wasn’t suppose to leave until 3:15 pm. So freaking out, I try calling at least 50 times and every time, it told me that had too many calls & would hang up. I understand with the virus, everything is crazy. I finally get someone to text me off their messaging on their app, turns out my flight was completely cancelled and they didn’t have any for the day I was suppose to leave. I never receive anything telling me my flight was cancelled, so if I would have not gotten ahold of that person, I would’ve gone to the airport over an hour away just to find out my flight was cancelled. Upon rescheduling, I now can only spend 2 days with my family & also have to drive 3 1/2 hours to Miami because they do not have any going from Key West back to Indy the day I need to be home. Very frustrating, and just wish they would’ve reached out about my flight being cancelled. The lady who helped me reschedule was very helpful through it all, but I will not be flying with Delta ever again."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Received no response from Delta,"I had a couple of issues with my flight on Delta (they changed it several times), filed a complaint online and received an email that they will respond in 7 business days.  It's more than a month and still waiting for their response.I wrote another email as to why their toll free number did not ask if we would like a call back from them or couldn't leave them a message.  It has been frustrating!  Still, no answer.  Is this how Delta operate?  Thinking of changing air carrier."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,"Bait and switch, overwhelmed/nonexistent customer service, DO NOT FLY DELTA","Purchased basic economy tickets 30-60 days in advance using Google's flights service. Week before trip, return flight had been partially rescheduled, resulting in an impossible return as the connecting flight was to be boarded one day before the flight from which we would deplane even departed. We called over a period of three days, morning, lunch, and evening, to try to get on the phone with a Delta rep. Wait times were listed at 6 hours one evening. After that attempt, the phone line repeatedly said, ""call volume too high, try later."" The website is a rat maze which dead ends at statements such as ""you bought a basic ticket and can't make changes"" to ""get on Twitter and look at all the people getting delayed customer service there."" It seems the exact opposite of an attempt to give the customer a perception of having any advocate. I may have bought a basic ticket, but I'm not basic enough to ask for customer service in a tweet.We spoke to someone in person in Seattle and they moved our return date one day forward, with their personal apology. They attempted to say that the issue was regarding covid, but it was truly that after we had paid and received a receipt, delta stopped flying to Casper Wyoming on Tuesdays.Delta has their employees embarrassedly apologize personally because the company does not apologize officially, or cannot afford to apologize, for whichever reason you like. Our flight to Casper from Salt Lake was delayed for a maintenance error, 15 min.We enjoyed our time in Casper and returned to Salt Lake on time, but because a Delta plane was having maintenance issues in the gate, we waited for 40 minutes and missed the connecting flight which Delta had rescheduled.We are now waiting for 12 hours until this evening to board a plane, hoping to get home by midnight a day and a half late, missing two extra unscheduled days of work as a result. The airport amenities are largely closed and we are not being compensated for our lost time at work.It would have been a great day to quit drinking! We were on a five day sober streak until Delta delta'd! Now I can drink $10 vodkas and lose even more money at the airport! Delta wins!Do not fly Delta. They do not want to serve the customer. They are too big to fail and too old to be taught. Communicating with them is like throwing stones over the castle wall. They will keep your money and pay their employees to explain how it's nobody's fault that you are missing work and wasting your day in a dead airport."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Na,I just what a video of a man women and there son get kicked off a delta airline due to the not taking the two options the airline gave them. I would never fly delta. I’m glad he recorded the whole thing
Date of travel: June 2020,50,Elderly Passenger Flight,On 6/16/20 gate B 17 the 8:50 flight from Cincinnati  to Salt lake. My 91 wheelchair  bound father was taking this flight. During the boarding process 4 Delta employees assisted my father in the boarding process. I am so grateful  for the kindness  and respect that these  Delta employees  showed my father . Working with the elderly  can be challenging  at best an these Delta employees  went above and beyond for my dad. Gentlemen i salute you.
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Don’t waste your money,"Don't Fly here. I got a Delta platinum card because I was told I would get perks, yet every time I try to use them, there is an issue. I'm told there are waived fees for military personal, but those never seem to go through. I spent 2 days trying to purchase flight tickets for my husband and I. I was told that I couldn't use the companion voucher even though I was told there were no stipulations when I received it. I try to use miles I've earned and there are issues with that next. I sit on the phone on hold for over 4 hours and I still don't get any help in my situation. Don't waste your time and fly a cheaper airline."
Date of travel: July 2019,50,Leader of the airlines,"Flew first class from Phoenix AZ to Atlanta and had a wonderful experience from checking in to lounge amenities, boarding and flight to ATL."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,DL Flight 2428,"On February 24, 2020: Flight 2428 was the 2nd leg of my last pre COVID-19 flight.  I was heading back to Indiana from visiting friends and family in Alabama.  From what I remember, that flight was no different than other Delta flights except for the fact that there was this really nice flight attendant named Joey.  He went above and beyond with making this flight one that I could enjoy.  So even though I'm super delayed in this post, I just had to make sure I did it.  Thank you."
Date of travel: June 2020,40,Passenger safety,"In stark contrast with American Airlnes, which I flew on the day before my Delta flight, the effort to follow good practices with respect to the Covid-19 was excellent.   The boarding process included the gate agent checking the jetway between calling groups to board,  to make certain there would not be congestion.   Upon boarding the flight attendant handed out a packet of hand sterilizer.    Once int he air, the passergers were given a package of bottled water, waffer, snack and another packet of hand sterilizer.   I did not see anyone in a middle seat and I estimate the flight was 60% full.   As we deplaned, the  passerngers respected distancing and patience.  I give Delta high marks for their efforts to keep passengers safe."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Delta Airlines Deliberately Defrauding Customers,"Delta has screwed me at least three times on this itinerary.  After spending hours on hold (couldn't book it online) I made a reservation, early in May to fly from Dalian, China to Atlanta on June 4, 2020.  I was quoted a price of $566.00....nonstop from Shanghai to Atlanta.   I was then transferred to the international dept.....hours on hold....only to have the call cut off.  Tried calling the international number and was again on hold for three hours...and again was cut off.  I got through the following day and was told that the price was now $810.00.....take it or leave it.   I took it...and paid extra for their ""Comfort+"" seat.   A week before my departure date I logged into my Delta account only to find that they had changed my itinerary resulting in my originating flight arriving 95 minutes AFTER the departure time for my connection in Shanghai.  I received NO notification of this change...and I did check my junk email file.   I called again...interminable time on hold...and again was about to be transferred when I demanded a supervisor.  He managed to change the departure from Dalian to the previous day...requiring me to spend a night in Shanghai.  I was unable to take those flights because of illness which forced me to cancel and receive an ecredit.   I am trying to rebook the flight now....but it's impossible.  I try to do it online and get a message that I have to call.  I try to call....after 4 hours on hold...cut off.  Tried calling back...optioned to have them call me back (in 9 hours)....but it's an international number....impossible.  It's pretty plain that Delta doesn't really want their customers to use the ecredits by making it impossible to book online or by phone.   I sent a complaint to Delta...but I'm not holding my breath on a reply.  How is it possible for Delta to expect customers to spend hours and hours on hold waiting to spend money with them?   It will be a cold day in hell before I fly Delta again.  I intend to file complaints with every single regulatory body I can find...as well as file a lawsuit when I do eventually get back to the US."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,"No chat, no email no representative to hear a customer!","I dont even know how to begin but one thing I can say that upper management of Delta lost its touch with reality and its customers when they decided to remove a chat option and email to change a reservation or make any alteration to the itinerary. If they don't provide several options of being reached by their customers they will be losing ppl left and right. I am a Platinum Amex sky mile and pay over $250 to have the luxury of this membership. Today I booked a ticket for my friend and once I clicked proceed I realized that I didn't change the name of a passenger and it is my name instead of my friend. I called Delta 5 times and was always hang up and heard how they don't have enough ppl to accommodate my phone call. I spend 40 min trying to find the option on line if I can chat to a representative or perhaps send an email so they understand that this was an immediate mistake and all i need is to change a name of the traveler. What you think anything! No phone call response no option to send an email or chat. Their site and they help page is absolutely useless and excludes a specific case like mine. It is a terrible service consider I pay a premium to not even being able to reach a representative. I called AMEX and at least I was able to reach them but unfortunately, they don't have any special way of getting to a delta it is all the same crap. AMEX representative told me he will ry to send an email to them. My current decision if they don't get back to me in 48 hours I will cancel my membership and spare myself $250 a year.  The airlines always happy to take our money but once we need help we cant even get a proper service treatment."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,No More Excuses!,"What has happens to DELTA? Have you made attempts to reach them? I have been a Delta customer for many years and the complete lack of service is without excuse. Using the App of late only results in an “Oops,” really, is that the best you can do? When I try to call, I am either placed on hold, then told, “the wait time is 9 hours and 40 minutes” after which you may choose to stay on the line or leave your name for a call back. Recently I was given the option to “text” what an absolute disaster that was! They do all they can not to to communicate with customers and that is very sad to me. Having an emergency or needing to change a reservation is mostly impossible so you are left with purchasing another ticket since speaking to someone is nearly impossible.Delta, you guys are at an all time low!"
Date of travel: March 2020,10,No refund?!,Delta are thieves?!January 23th i booked a flight through Dutch Delta website. It was a flight from Amsterdam to Liberia Costa Rica. I have paid with Real Time banking the amount 644 dollar. I didnt get any confirmation so i contacted customer service in the Netherlands which is done by KLM/Air France the same day. They confirmed they recieved the payment but the booked flight didnt exsist so therefore i did not get a ticketnumber. Customer service in the Netherlands told me the refund is handled in the US. My first claim was voided by Lisa Ferani due to no ticket number.... i had contact on Twitter with Delta and they told me to have contact with Dutch Customer service and so i did. A friendly representative from KLM made a call to Delta US again because the employee i had spoken to wasn't helpfull at all. A new case/claim was made by Riannon at the beginning of April. Today i have recieved an email from Felicia Jackson that my claim is void again due to....no ticket number. I have send the proof of payment (dutch PDF file from my bankaccount) My money is somewhere so i have decided to take legal action. I already made over 250 dollars of costs to get my money back and that is enough. I always was very satisfied with Delta Air Lines... but now i wont think i will ever fly again with them. My advise: always use a creditcard for booking a flight! Then you dont have to through this!
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Will never fly delta again,Paid 150 extra for each plane ticket because they said it was one way and then they changed to connections and blamed it on covid 19 what does that have to do with one way or connections - they changed how long my flight added 3 days and changed my moms ticket where we weren’t sitting together and they did it again on the way back and the stewardess gave me so much attitude for trying to sit near my mom we paid 600 to change tickets when there was no fee Chang on tickets - delta is a terrible airline go with JetBlue who cares about there customers - the only reason why I did not is because delta falsely advertised Oneway tickets this was a bait and switch scam - do not fly delta if there is a problem there is also and 10 hour or more wait to talk on the phone with delta.
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Flight canceled at check in,"These ridiculous losers canceled my ticket a week before my trip, once my car rental and Airbnb was booked. I got my ticket for 279$ and after they canceled there like we can rebook for 407$ so just not to argue I booked that. Once I got to airport to check in with my confirmation email the screen said error. So I went to talk to this fat scum bag ladie and she told me that’s there’s nothing they can do and my ticket was not paid for therefore canceled. That’s bs because they took the 407$ out of my bank account on top of all that I call 4 days before my trip to make sure that my ticket was still good to go and it was. No email warning for my last ticket cancelation and they put my money back the morning I was flying out. So I ended up paying 950$ for a plane ticket with Alaska. Honestly I was a finger nail away from dropping the fat cow that assisted me. I will try to open a law suit against them for cause huge stress financial loss and for not warning me about my last flight cancellation"
Date of travel: July 2019,10,Beware...they don't honor fares!,BEWARE...I booked a flight when prices were low about a month ago.   I just saw an email in my SPAM folder informing they have cancelled the flight.   They did make some changes to flights but could have still gotten me to my destination.  I really feel like they didn't want to honor the cheaper fare I paid AND they aren't taking phone calls.  They said in the email (that I found in my SPAM folder) that my refund will be in the form of an e-credit!  Seriously?? I am so angry with Delta they will be the last on my list to ever fly on!  I am one angry grandma just trying to get to the Air Force Base to see my new grandbaby!
Date of travel: July 2019,10,Flight Changes & Communication,"I have tried to reach unsuccessfully Mr. Bastian (CEO), and that is truly unfortunate - because he should know personally how frustrating it is to communicate with his organization.  I have made ""several"" calls this morning to correct an arbitrary decision by Delta to change my wife's flight plans.  I'm guessing her original reservation wasn't valid - even though it was confirmed by Delta Reservations.  These kinds of changes impact people's schedules and lives.  If you have to make a decision like this, it is on the logistics and scheduling/reservation elements of Delta...not the customer.  Don't overbook a flight, and then disadvantage a customer because the reservations team can't balance the load. Secondary to inconvenient change above is how Delta now communicates with the customer via the automated attendant.  Delta's system is woefully inadequate!   Automated call attendants are frustrating, but Delta has now taken it to a new level.  You reach a certain point in the Delta communication process where you are told they cannot answer your call.  This is truly a first, as I have never been dismissed from call queue because an organization was too busy (or understaffed) to field my call -- and the organization should receive credit for it.  Staff cuts, budget reductions - just flat out don't care anymore???  In either case, this signals the beginning of a new awareness worth noting.Unfortunately, because of the delays and frustration, I have elevated this complaint to the DOT.  I hope it helps in improving the current process, which I believe your customers would tell you is broken, or at best…very seriously flawed. One last fun fact...I have been on hold this morning for 51 minutes for Delta Reservations...after being disconnected over 10 times."
Date of travel: June 2020,50,International flights always a treat!,"I love flying Delta for my international travels. I fly all over the world and I have tried other airlines, none stand out like Delta does. With their rewards programs and using AMEX Delta Rewards along side, you can't beat it. I haven't had a negative experience yet and I look forward to my next trip with Delta."
Date of travel: June 2020,50,Only Delta,"My June 5th trip from San Diego (SAN) to New York (JFK) was off to a rocky start when I ran into TSA and security delays. I rushed out to the gate only to find that the plane had left early. This amazing gate agent (Denzo) somehow got me onto the last flight of the day from SAN to JFK ASAP, which was amazing because this flight was scheduled to leave right around the same time as the one which I had originally booked!!!!Flight #1 on my trip was a bit rocky, but, I mean, that's to be expected when landing in Salt Lake City. Flight #2 was amazing, though. In spite of a thunderstorm warning, the plane, under Pilot Mark Naro, smoothly soared during the entire flight.I am, moreover, impressed by how effectively Delta instituted social distancing measures. Increased air cirulation in the cabins, distancing enabled by empty middle rows, rigerous sanitation, and face covering all left me feeling far more safe than I could have imagined: flying during COVID-19  was actually not scary!!My only complaints:1. Clarify online check-in policy. Change the section titled ""recommended check-in time"" with checked bags to ""required check-in time with checked bags."" This is seriously confusing and can risk customers missing flights.2. Provide a snack option edible for everyone. Cheeze-Its, the current snack option provided by Delta, are great in that they are vegitarian, but they are, unfortunately, an issue for anyone with lactose intolerance, which is fairly common in the US, especially among minority groups.Overall, I am thankful for Delta's amazing crew, who saved my trip and, moreover, are working ardously to keep customers comfortable as well as SAFE during the current crisis."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Stranded with no refund or alternative.,"My sister and I were traveling to Myrtle beach and we were on our first flight on our 1 stop flight. While on the plane, the flight attendants had some issues with some ladies having a laptop out. There was some arguing back and forth between the passengers and the flight attendants (one not even attempting to be nice to the passengers) and the issue had been resolved. We still had to turn the plane around and then we sat there at the gate for almost an hour. After that they decided to kick the ladies off the flight and we left shortly after that. When arriving to Atlanta, (connecting flight) we ran to the gate to try and make it, but the flight had already left. We spoke with some representatives about maybe taking a flight at another time but they only had one the next day. They would not refund us any money back or offer anything to make this situation right! The airline is the worst! Don’t fly delta even if it is the cheaper alternative. They don’t care about their passengers... no one tried to help us. We had to rent a car and drive to our destination."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,CANCELLED FLIGHT 3 DAYS BEFORE SCHEDULED TO TRAVEL,"I will NEVER fly delta again! I am traveling with 4 family members and 3 of them booked together and my little sister booked separate. They cancelled her booking without an option of booking another flight, yet gave the other 3 of us the option to go onto another flight. IF THIS ISNT UNACCEPTABLE i don’t know what is. YOU CANNOT contact customer service “due to high call volume” they have shut that option off. HOW DO YOU EXPECT ME TO GET THIS RESOLVED. I am beyond disappointed with how everything is being handled. This flight alone costs 1300$! I purchased this ticket 5 months ago, and ITS CANCELLED THREE DAYS BEFORE WE ARE TO DEPART? Unacceptable delta! Unacceptable!!!!!"
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Cancelled my flight twice with no notification,"I booked a flight in early March for a weekend trip in April. Delta changed my original flight schedules and made it so I would miss my connecting flight and never notified me. I noticed while checking my own schedule. After going through the process of rescheduling, one of my flights was cancelled a week before my departure date and again I wasn't notified. This time I couldn't call in to talk to anyone as their phones were all busy. I tried for days to get ahold of someone, both on the phone and messaging on their app. Communication with them has been impossible."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Vacation gone bad,"Really Upset!!! I book the flight for my mom 2 months in advance . I requested time off  we had things plan.  My mom gets to the airport 3 hours before the flight depart.  when my mom gets to the front desk they had her waiting for almost an hour. the delta representative had her waiting an hour to finally tell her she miss the cut of time and they have to put her in another flight. not to mention that is still over 2 hours till the plane departs, i ask to speak to a supervisor and the lady did not help me she was forcing us to take the boarding pass to the new flight. My mom did not want to flight anymore as they want it her to take a flight with a stop and she was gonna be there almost all day. My vacation got messed up, my plans got cancel now i have to worry about having to get refunds and cancellation to events. I try calling the airline and of corse do to the high volume of calls my call does not get thru, i get online and nothing is easy I'm upset the website is not easy.i finally cancel the flight now have to worry about a refund. and I'm making sure to do reviews in as much as social media as possible. Terrible service terrible. not to mention this was already a different flight from our original booking. so upsetting. didn't even get to flight."
Date of travel: June 2020,40,Great job!,As with the first leg of my journey Delta did a wonderful job applying social distancing measures to the airline. Handing out wipes and hand sanitizer was a really nice touch.
Date of travel: June 2020,40,Pleasant flight,"Had a pleasant flight on my trip, the staff was very nice and the social distancing measures were greatly appreciated, thank you Delta!"
Date of travel: June 2020,10,terrible airline,"We booked our flight 3 weeks ago.  it was from myrtle beach to atlanta (50 min lay over) then direct to portland.  came for return.  Today as I check on the delta page about when we can check in, I find they changed the flights.  our 50 min lay over is 5 hrs going out and 19hrs coming back.   Of course the phone lines are busy (wonder why) sadly we already booked an place to stay in portland or I would cancel the whole trip.  we picked delta because it was from an airport close by and short total flight time.  Southwest about same price but from airport 2 hrs away. sad part was no email or test from delta about the change.  Just hiding from the argument and waiting so people get stuck with still flying on the garage airline that pulled the whole flight so you have to wait until next day."
Date of travel: June 2020,10,STAY AWAY if traveling with disabled or elderly,They are rude. My sister at hotel now and on oxygen. How she gonna wait 2 days in a hotel when her oxygen is in tennessee tonight? RUDE delta staff at Denver airport. I trusted them. My 85 year old mom is with her stuck in hotel too. THis is terrible.
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Flight cancelled and cannot get through to Customer Service,"I am sooo not happy with this airline right now. We booked a few weeks ago to fly from BWI to GGT (Great Exuma) in July. We just got an email saying our flight has been cancelled, due to Covid. However, my girlfriend and her family who are suppose to meet us there are flying American Airlines and their flight has not been cancelled! Now we are being forced to use this ecredit while we lose money because we can’t use it to fly to our original destination. Nobody is available!! You can’t get through! It doesn’t even give you an option to speak to someone because it hangs up on you! Worst customer service ever!!"
Date of travel: June 2020,10,Customer service is absolutely awful.,Phone lines are a minimum of 2 hours wait to talk to a representative. They don't give you the option for a refund on the site only an ecredit that expires in a short timeframe. I will absolutely never fly delta again. They are the worst airline in the USA for quality and customer service. DO NOT FLY DELTA!!
Date of travel: May 2020,20,Confirmed booking cancelled and Looking for Refund,Well Last Month I did reservations from Delta airlines to Los Angeles From Delhi but due to unexpected Lockdown I had to cancel my flight and was looking for refund which was schedule to come within a week but I didn't get it and after contacting to customer service also I didn't get much response and saying they can't help me until 7 days to departure put my call down.So please be specific to customer responsibilities.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,No issues at all,"The check-in process was smooth. No issues at all while waiting to board. The seats were comfortable with enough leg room. The flight attendants were very nice and they had great snacks. Nothing was over-the-top great about the flight, but there were absolutely no hiccups, which is just what I would want in a flight. Will definitely fly Delta again!"
Date of travel: May 2020,10,"Delta people great, Management very bad.  IT worse.",Diamond elite status phone line 5 hours.  I had selected to put on the upgrade list and selected an aisle next to my companion and daughter.  Delta IT moved me to an economy cabin window seat (my profile preference is isle) away from my companion.  I cannot change upgrade request due to check in online but will have to call which is a 5 hour hold time... as highest elite status.  I waited over an hour earlier today on hold until I had to give up.
Date of travel: May 2020,10,Worst customer service anywhere,"I just checked my flight status and found out they changed the hours on the depart and return.  Spent $1,000 in Jan. so I could have good hours and seats.  Now they are getting me to my destination hours late so by the time I get to my beach suite it will be midnite instead of enjoying the sunset on the beach.   The suite isn't cheap.   Then on the return they got me leaving 6 hours earlier but a 6 hour layover in Atlanta of all places &  arriving late.  So I tired to modify on website but they were going to charge me for changes!!  They screw my flight up and have the gall to charge me for their screw up.  Called flight change and got recording they are not taking calls until 7 days until departure?  Then called customer service and talked with a person named Jenna who mumbled something and hung up.  Then called again and Ivy switched me to a recording saying they can't help me until 7 days to departure.  I give up.  I've flown over 50 times and this is the worst and I have not even got on my plane yet."
Date of travel: May 2020,10,WORST AIRLINE  EVER,"Where shall I start? I am sure I am not the only one to complain about this. My family and I have planned a trip to Universal Studious  Orlando June 9- June 16, 2020. We decided top play it safe like a lot of other people and canceled our trip. The resort and Universal gave us a FULL REFUND BUT NOT Delta. They gave us these stupid Ecredits. They gave us a 2 year window to use them. If the price increases ( WHICH I AM 100% SURE DELTA WILL BE INCREASING THEIR PRICES) to the same destination we had planned we have to pay the difference. If we are unable to use the Ecredits in the time allowed we are out the amount the tickets cost us. Either way we are out the amount we paid for the tickets.  They have no compaction for their customers in these hard times everyone is going through. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER ( MELISSA CHAMBERS). THEY ONLY Care about lining their pockets and not caring about their customers what so ever. I have filled a law suit against them and I am sure I am not the only person. USE A DIFFEENT AIRLINE!!!"
Date of travel: February 2020,30,flight facilities were good but there are some issues which I addressed in my review,"Like many others Airlines, Delta Airlines also published on their website that their top priority is the health and safety of their clients. Therefore they would not charge any cancellation or change fees during the corona virus outbreak. They did indeed waive the change fee but when Re-Booking the business class fare was twice more for the same flight. Understand this correctly: the fare was twice more expensive when re-booking, but not when booking a new flight on that same date. The Facilities are good but hiking the Business class is not a good gesture in these times"
Date of travel: May 2020,10,Delta DISAPPOINTS!,"NOT TRUE DELTA! Your customers are NOT your priority. I'm so incredibly frustrated and disappointed with Delta Airlines. As if all we are going through because of the pandemic weren't enough! Our daughter was suppose to get married in France in July. Because of the Coronavirus the dream wedding she's been planning for over a year had to be cancelled. We booked our flights months ago with Delta. Paid in full. Before we could even call to cancel our flights, Delta emailed us letting us know they canceled the flight to France (certainly due to corona). They informed us they'd be giving us an e-credit. We wanted and expected a full refund since they cancelled the flight. It's taken me WEEKS to get through to Delta. Finally, after a 2 hour wait I spoke with an agent who informed me that Delta was unable to give me a refund because my flights were on Air France and they no longer had control over my tickets. I would have to wait as much as 45 days for the refund to be processed and then 2 billing cycles to get my thousands of dollars refunded (money we could really use right now). I purchased my tickets from Delta! Not Air France. My sister was to fly on the same flight to France. She called Delta just as I did and was given a full refund the very next day! That was just last week! So disappointed to see that Delta appears to be making it up as they go along. And to add insult to injury, I called again today to try to have them explain how my sister was given a refund and I'm not, the supervisor I spoke with was horrible. They said their name is Isabel and when I asked for their last name they said that was ""confidential"". Their attempt to explain Delta's position was pathetic at best. They said ""somehow"" Air France took hold of our tickets and now Delta can't refund them. I asked how is it that Air France took over my tickets if I purchased them from Delta. Their answer, ""I don't know""! If the supervisor doesn't know how things work Delta is in big trouble. They were also rude and dismissive. I expected so much more from this airline. I understand these are stressful times for everyone. But for Delta to wash its hands of responsibility and not give a reasonable explanation when they are the only ones who can refund my money which they collected in full is unacceptable and unprofessional. Shame on them."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Excellent cabin crew and ground crew,"My family has always travelled Delta Airlines from Europe to Tucson for many years.  We've flown other US carriers, but Delta has the best service.  Flight Attendants were very friendly and a Gate Agent in London was too outstanding.  He got us on an earlier flight when we had to cut off vacation short due to a family emergency.  At first, he told us that all the flights were completely booked, but he managed to create magic and got us home to Tucson.  We'll never forget his help."
Date of travel: May 2020,40,Refund from Delta due to Covid-19,"I still recommend Delta. I had three tickets for June 20 to US Virgin Islands. Delta cancelled. According to the DOT ruling last week, all airlines MUST refund passengers for flights that were cancelled due to pandemic. I tried three days in a row to call Delta...because they issued me an E-credit and what I want is my money back. I finally gave up due to long hold times. I called American Express card that I used to pay for the tickets and they disputed the charge. They said no payment is required of me..so....Im off the hook."
Date of travel: May 2020,10,Delta SUCKS,"*HOW CAN WE HELP? I was a standby for flight 3635, gate c7. When I arrive I tried to request some information in regards to the flight to the gate CSR, who in a rude manner replied: I'm most likely not going to be able to get you in the plane, please go back to your sit until I call your name. I waited for the next 30 to 40 minutes. After a few rounds of passengers boarding, he said ""any other passangers please come to the gate"". I went there, tried to scan my ticket but iit marked a red light, to what he asked if I was confirmed, which I said no. Then he proceeded to raise his voice and say: I told you to stay in your sit until I called you, you're most likely not going to be able to flight. After 20 more minutes, he announced that he was about to close the gate, so I stood up and tried to inquire about any other flights, his answered was not only rude, but once again with a louder voice and a really mean attitud, said to me: ma'am, if you keep interrupting I can't do my job and I can't help you, you are not going to be able to board the flight. Another customer as well tried to ask for information, to which he said: sir I am helping ""this woman first"" you are going to have to wait. The expression on everybody's face was reflecting frustration and clearly everyone was upset about the poor behavior and horrible customer service provided by this CSR. He then proceeded to tell me that there were no other flights to my destination for the rest of the day, he then asked if there was anywhere else I wanted to flight?. Nearest airport I said was OKC, which is over 2 hours drive from my house. He said I would once again be on a stand by for that flight for which I would have to wait 8 hours for it to depart. He then gave me a phone number to call and said that there was no guarantee that I was going to be able to flight tonight. After he handed me over a piece of paper with a hand written phone number, I asked what his name was, for what his answer was NO. I asked what he meant by that, to what he replied: I have helped you the best I could. O once again asked for his name and once again raising his voice he said NO. Then he said, you know what, it's Dean, let's just say it's Dean.  Never have I ever, been treated so poorly by a CSR, I will never flight on this airline again."
Date of travel: May 2020,10,Worst Experience Ever!,We arrived to the airport and checked in around 12 pm. We didn’t get to the gate until 102pm due to very slow tsa lines because of the Coronavirus. Our flight was supposed to depart at 105 but sadly we came to find our flight had left 10 minutes prior. I don’t understand how a airline can see people who have checked in and have not made it to the gate but still allow the plane to leave early not even bothering to wait until the departure time listed on the ticket to see if the they show up knowing they are already checked in and the bags are on the plane! I asked to get another flight and was told that there was no more flights available for today and that I would have to wait until tomorrow therefore I just got a refund. This is the worst experience I’ve ever had with an airline! I will not be spending anymore money with delta ever again and do not recommend them at all!
Date of travel: May 2020,10,Do NOT book a flight with Delta,"Delta re-booked my flight from SFO to Nashville.  This is what they actually booked: SFO 12:05 p.m. landing DTW at 7:31 p.m. then DTW departing (the same day) at 12:40 p.m. to Nashville landing at 1:11 p.m.  Not even possible since I wouldn't even land in DTW until 7:31 p.m.  Tried to handle online, but their website said I had to call.  No problem - call and get it handled.  First day, wait time 8 hours and 15 minutes , but leave your number and they'll call you back.  Left my number and they called back 16 hours later at 12:02 a.m. when I was asleep.  Next day 2 hour and 37 minute hold time and no option for the call back.  Now on hold for for 4 hours and 30 minutes and 37 seconds and they still have not picked up the phone.  A friend has done the same dance for the past 3 days and after holding for over 8 hours, on one of the days, they disconnected the call.  Today they disconnected her call after 4 hours and 15 minutes of her being on hold. The WORST customer service I have ever experienced."
Date of travel: August 2019,10,Would Rather Not....,Just try to speak with someone who is helpful.... someone who speaks  English clearly... or have a hold time less than SIX HOURS.  This is the WORST airlines and one I won't book unless my other options are SEVERELY LIMITED.
Date of travel: May 2020,10,They totally changed our flight and we can't call them,"Delta changed our 2 stop flight to 4 stops with a 40 hour layover in Toronto. They also had us landing 4 hours AFTER the next flight was scheduled. On the return they have our first return flight with the second flight scheduled 2 days before we leave.  You cannot contact them and the wait time to speak to someone  is 7, 12 or 9 hours, depending on when I tried. This is not customer service, it's a joke."
Date of travel: May 2020,10,Delta sucks,Refused a refund during pandemic when booked understanding it was refundable up to 30 days prior. Waited almost an hour on phone to speak to someone who basically said I lied to them.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,"During These Times, Companies Doing Good Should Be Acknowledged","I had a flight scheduled for March 14, 2020.  Trump stopped most flights from Europe on March 12, 2020.  Despite the chaos that this created on short notice, I was able to go on Delta's site (took a couple reloads, but they were slammed) and rebook my flights.  Full credit for my original purchase price.Considering the poor experiences that I've had with other travel vendors, I want to acknowledge those who have did their best during these times."
Date of travel: May 2020,10,Republic Airways  connection partner of Delta Airlines - REPUBLIC AIRWAYS - MECHANICAL DELAYS,"I have been flying over 50 years as an airline, aircraft 'nerd' with pride.  I had the worst customer service experience by a shocking nasty flight attendant that along with another mechanical delay from Republic -  I urge anyone with urgency with their trip and you see DELTA AIRLINES d.b.a Republic Airways.  RUN TO A BUS TERMNAL or any main line airline option."
Date of travel: November 2019,10,First Class suched,I have never spend so much for so little.  I could not even get out of my seat unless I turned backward.  I will never fly Delta again.
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Delta is becoming more classy,"On international flights, Delta is becoming a much more classy carrier. With snacks out in between meal services and seat-back entertainment, its a great airline to fly - especially when you can get cheaper deals."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Comfortable Flight,"Pretty typical flight.  Short, comfortable, everything was straightforward and handled well.  On the way back, there was more of a COVID scare, & handled well.  Overall definitely recommend them in the future!"
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Comfortable Flight,Very comfortable nonstop flight to Kingston. Boarding went smoothly and the flight attendants were extraordinary in making sure we were comfortable.
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Very Good Flight,"I had another nice experience flying with Delta. The staff was very nice as always, and the service was good. There were no TVs on the plane, which I would have liked, but instead they offered an app that you could download and watch movie and shows for free, which was a good substitute. For the price, the flight was overall a great value."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Customer Service,"Throughout this Pandemic, Delta has done the best job of keeping us updated throughout emails and their customer service.  I was easily able to chat with someone after about a 10 minute wait on their app.  They helped me navigate cancelling my flight and how the credit works and offered to help me book my  next flight.  Delta is definitely my preferred way to travel and I really appreciate their customer service throughout this unknown time!"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Above and Beyond,"My husband and I were wintering in Puerto Vallarta for three months scheduled to return March 28 On Aeromexico to Detroit with a stop in Mexico City. We are Canadian so our final stop was Windsor Ontario. We made the reservations through Cheapo Air. It was a nightmare in getting confirmation waiting for credit verification. I called my bank and they were not the hold up and were prepared to approve. Follow up re approval for oxygen and a scooter were also problematic.On Tuesday March 3 Trump terminated flights from Europe. We heard him a few weeks before saying he may close the southern border. We decided because of the uncertainty of Trump, we could not take a chance and should return home while we still could. We spent three agonizing and unfruitful days trying to get rescheduled through Cheapo Air and Aeromexico. Finally, I told my husband to call Delta and we could not get through. He finally went to the Airport on Thursday March 12 and saw a Delta counter booking flights. She cancelled the Aeromexico flights on March 28 and applied the refund to a Delta flight on March 16. She finalized the approvals for my oxygen and scooter. (We had all the information for these.) She referred it to another gentleman, and It was completed in five minutes. I cannot tell you how grateful we were. Don’t know her or his name but they were fabulous and deserve to be thanked.We were on the Delta flight which left PV at 12:40 pm to arrive in Detroit on March 16, 2020. The handicapped support in Puerto Vallarta and Detroit were excellent.Most of all I want to thank the entire crew. They were amazing. I had a nebulizer with a fully charged battery, but the battery did not work. I did not know about the plug at the seat. I think because of that and wearing a mask my oxygen was low and I had an exacerbation. Every single one of the crew helped. When I told them what I needed, they supported me in every way. All were concerned as to how I was doing. They were patient and calm. Every single one of that crew. Because of their support I was able to avert a full-blown exacerbation.I will fly Delta from now and book directly with Delta."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Nice Flight,"Great boarding, good flight, left on time, nice service in flight.  Great gate area... lots of space and had nice, modern Dunkin Donuts.  On plane, seat was fine, excellent TV setup, large screen and good selection of titles and live TV.  Meal served, breakfast was not great. Packaged food (yogurt) was fine.  Sandwich was inedible."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Easy direct flight from NYC to Mexico City,My partner and I flew on Delta right at the beginning of the crisis (before the epidemic turned into a pandemic) and the crew did everything they could to make us comfortable with the experience. Everyone was kind and calm and took extra health precautions and went above and beyond in terms of constant communication.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,First time using Amex Delta Skymiles Card!,"This was the first flight after getting the Amex Delta Skymiles card and the experience was great! We were able to check our bags for free, and received priority boarding. Definitely worth the investment as I plan on taking many delta flights in the future."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Empty flight!,"Flew to Orlando from Boston amid the early stages of the corona outbreak, and the flight was practically empty. The flight attendants were super friendly and allowed us to essentially choose our seats due to the open space! Boarding was super quick and we had no issues with carry on luggage space running out!"
Date of travel: April 2020,50,Quarantine flights,"One of the best airport, airline experiences of my life. Granted the airports were empty, no more than 50 ppl on each fight. I was also flying first class for the first time ever, because it was so cheap, only 130 more than basic And Two free 70 pound checked bags included, instead of spending 70 dollars extra for two 50 pound bags. That was a great help when coming back from living abroad for most of last year. My favorite part about it though was the surprise in the In flight snack boxes. Thank his someone higher up has realized that organic and non gmo snacks are the only kind i will eat. Not some disgusting garbage brand junk food. Higher quality snacks were crucial because it was my only food for my 36 hours worth of flights and waiting - since evevrything In the airports was closed. It was a life saver and I’m so happy that some smart person at delta figured out that people want quality food!! Thanks for a fantastic trip"
Date of travel: April 2020,10,THIS AIRLINE LIES AND STEALS,I regret flying this airlines. Never again will I. They will steal your money and lie to you. Worst experience and worst customer customer service I ever got. Charged $248.10 to get my bag. I was quoted $230 initially and then it went up from.
Date of travel: April 2020,10,Kicked off the plane with wife and children just for asking to change seats!,"My wife, 2 children and I boarded the flight and asked for a seat change if possible from the flight attendants. They replied that they had to check with the gate agent who was at the gate desk named Errol. He was entering the plane and immediately used the social distancing excuse and the COVID 19 to avoid even looking into our request. He said the seats can't be changed in a rude and humiliating way that made my wife and I embarrassed which can be confirmed by the passengers sitting around us. Other passengers als wanted to change their seats as they were in our proximity but the flight attendant looking after the rear economy cabin denied them this request. The gate agent Errol returned to me and asked me to step outside the plane in the presence of the pilot and informed me that I have to remove my family and carry-ons from this flight and that we will be booked on the next flight leaving after 5 hours as he claimed that we were rowdy and created disturbance in the cabin. He also insisted that our checked-in luggage stays on the flight as there was no time to off load it and delay the flight and that we will get the 4 bags once we land in LAX on the next flight. I tried to reason with him but he threatened and intimidated me and my wife and scared my 12-yr old twins who were almost in tears. The attendant in the rear economy cabin a middle age guy whom I wasn't able to get his name was encouraging him and making what I could understand uncalled for accusations in front of my children. We finally left the plane and went to the gate again where a supervisor named Rosa in purple dress came to talk to us as she was the manager of this Erol. He told her what happened and Rosa said to him to go to the plane to stop it  and she would follow him to talk to the pilot can crew to allow us back in but by the time she reached they had already closed the plane door and pushed back., She apologized to us and helped us get seats on the next departing flight 5 hours later. Erol was not apologetic and insisted that he did the right thing to off load us.. I was left with my family in the airport waiting 5 hours, not knowing if our luggage made it to LAX or not, stuck, kids trying to work on their iPad homework, and my wife and I fuming and frustrated at this outcome of getting kicked off a flight for no reason except asking to change our seats. In my 50 years of travelling and flying I have never been kicked off any flight and not threatened by a gate agent of a flight attendant and humiliated in front of my family and passengers on the flight. This is outrageous. I wrote to Delta and demanded an investigation and an apology from the airline, termination and dismissal of the gate agent Errol and the male flight attendant on the flight in the rear cabin who was supporting the gate agent to kick us off, and a reprimand to the pilot who was present during this event and witnessed the gate agent actions. I am yet to hear back from Delta on this disaster."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Best domestic airline ,Delta is more consistently on time than other airlines and has the best in flight entertainment! Love being able to track my flight and watch tv especially on cross country flights like this one. Flights are generally more expensive but worth it.
Date of travel: September 2019,10,Worst airline ever!!!!,"WORST AIRLINE EVER !!! I traveled with Delta in September, when I booked my flights they told me that my surfboard would be considered as standard luggage and I wouldn’t have to pay any additional costs but at the airport they charged me $100 (even tho I already paid for a luggage that I didn’t have). Arriving in Hawaii, they broke my surfboard and never answered my request from October 2019! (No apologize, no compensation, it was a brand new surfboard). Then I changed my return flight because of the Corona, they charged me $200 when the changes were supposed to be free and don’t wanna refund me for that. Finally they canceled my return flight and put me on another different route and do not want to refund me or send me a voucher for the part of the canceled flight that I paid for even if they are not able to take me to my final destination.Delta you are scammers, I will never travel with you again!"
Date of travel: April 2020,30,"Jacob, Customer service rep","Jacob deserves a billion stars! After hours of back and forth and eventually getting the run around about cancelled flights (as in 3 cancelled returning flights) Jacob was my savior! He understood my frustration and went above and beyond to help me get back home!! I couldnt thank him enough!! (But dont book ur flight thru expedia, they'll screw ya over everytime!) Book thru delta from the start."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,People experience flight with Delta Air Lines,"The website of Delta Air Lines is user-friendly and the transaction is fluent. The ground staff is friendly and polite, they also handle my luggage with care. The lounge is elegant and there are a lot of services, like buffet, showering facilities, and different kinds of entertainment like magazines, and Wi-Fi. The ground staff are friendly and they are quick in checking the passports. When I got onboard, the flight attendants welcomed me with warm greetings. When I settled down, they even provided me with welcome cocktails. There were varieties of flight meals and they were delicious. The flight entertainment was awesome too, they even provide recently shown movies! The smell of the plane was good and relaxing. But the blue light was a bit annoying as it made everything look blue, even when I got off the plane. The flight attendants bid their farewells sincerely. I will definitely travel with Delta Air Lines again!!"
Date of travel: March 2020,10,LAX and Delta - - two words thatshould make you scared,"Delta's bravado about their work on LAX's terminal 2&3.  It is chaos with ZERO staff to direct you .... the lines are awful with no one directing.  Terminal 3 is shocking in it condition and lack of seating from the multitude of flights.

Date of travel: April 2020,10,"UNETHICAL, A TOTAL SCAM","Flights DL8571, 8657, 9459, 9606 booked  through KIWI.COM for the beginning of April with DELTA AIRLINES (flights operated by AIRFRANCE), amounting to over 700€, were cancelled by the airline. On 2 April,  I contacted DELTA AIRLINES to request they reschedule these flights for a later date.  I received an automatic reply email from AIRFRANCE, no solution offered.  I emailed DELTA again on 16 April and received another automatic reply message from AIRFRANCE saying all requests have to be made through KIWI.COM.I am totally dissatisfied and completely disagree with the way both KIWI.COM and these airlines are behaving.  It would appear that for these airlines, KIWI passengers do NOT have the same rights as passengers who booked flights directly through DELTA.  On DELTA's webpage, passengers can reschedule flights at no charge or request a flight voucher valid till 2022.  Not offering the same conditions to passengers who booked flights with them through KIWI.COM is discriminatory and unfair. On the other hand,  all KIWI.COM offers is for you to process a claim which they will present to the airline, but with no guarantees.  Moreover,  to add insult to injury,  KIWI.COM are cashing in on the chaos caused by cancelled flights and, if you desire a quick reply regarding claims (6 weeks),  you have to pay for it.  I already paid over 700€ for the flights and also the KIWI guarantee, which appears to be of no use.  Numerous passengers in the same situation mean these airlines, along with KIWI.COM, are not only shunning their responsibility by not offering reasonable solutions to KIWI.COM passengers but are also taking advantage to make money out of this situation.  TOTALLY UNETHICAL!!  NB   I also booked other flights for April through low cost airlines and they immediately offered online rescheduling of flights at no cost."
Date of travel: April 2020,10,No corona virus precautions,"I flew from memphis to New York on delta airlines with a connection in Atlanta. On the fight from Memphis to Altanta none of the airline staff had face covers or mask. Not at check in at the airport or on the plane. I was told by staff mask are optional for the staff. From Atlanta to New York was better with only the Pilot chosing not to wear a mask as he stood at the door and thank you for flying delta from less then 2 feet a distance. Terrible experience, thanks Delta."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,The most considerate airline I have ever flown.,"With all the chaos of the flu crisis, I was able to cancel our anniversary tickets that were purchased with miles easily. The person I talked to in the chat line was so nice and pleasant. My miles were put back on right away, and my fee will be put back on my account. I was so suprised!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Off to Thailand comfort class,"We flew though Seattle to Seoul changing to Korean Air to Phuket. Our KC to Seattle was a smooth flight with an easy change in Seattle. We flew comfort class to Seoul and it was worth every penny. We had seats with a bit more room. The service was outstanding. Just after departure the stewards came around with a delicious Peach Bellini drink. They handed out menus that had a timeline for services and what choices would be offered. What a brilliant idea! The food was wonderful and DID NOT feel like micro portioned microwaved dinners. The stewards were friendly and accommodating. When booking the trip we were told we would love Korean Air. No the case. While the flight attendants were gorgeous and well coiffed, the service was awful. I was very sad to realize we had to take Korean Air all the way back to the states and didn't get to take Delta, again. DELTA will definitely be my fist choice on any long haul flights. The inflight, back of seat, screens had hundreds of options for entertainment."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,glad to be updated,"I'd flown out on Premium Economy and frankly just plain Economy didn't look very welcoming. My wife, bless her, insisted on putting me on the waiting list for an upgrade a couple of days before the flight.It turned out that the worst of the journey was waiting at the gate in MSP. Check in was fine and even the TSA checks seemed a little more smooth and efficient than usual. But then I got to the gate.Just too many people waiting there. Nowhere to sit, except the bar, which of course wanted me to buy a drink for sitting there. So many people standing I could barely see the minitors. Not well planned.I did get a Premium Economy seat and was grateful for the modicum of extra leg room. The flight left on time and arrived early. Food stayed down this time. Service polite but not excessively so.They've changed the system for trasfering to domestic flights at Haneda. The new system involves a very long walk."
Date of travel: April 2020,10,Delta  canceled my flight won't refund my money.,"Delta canceled my flight. They won't refund my money. On hold for hours. Transferred, hold again. Then women says she can't hear me. They say I must take a credit. I never used the service. I don't want a future ticket. I need money for my mortgage and for food. The government is giving them my tax dollars for free except for 3% in warrants. Give me my money back. Why do I have to loan them money. Total thievery."
Date of travel: April 2020,10,Delta screwed me,"Flight is CHO to DFW with a layover in ATL. Flew from CHO to ATL and plane took off 40 minutes after original takeoff time. Made it to my connecting flight gate (A9) with four minutes before departure and could not board. Next connecting flight available was 12 hours later. Stuck at the airport for an extra 12 hours with no offer for a hotel and no meal tickets. Would I fly Delta, again? HELL, NO."
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Efficient,"I had a long wait between flights, so it was a relief to finally get on board and settle into my seat. In fact, I did most of my sleeping before takeoff. After that it was read a book; watch a TV show; read a book; watch the flight progress on the seat-back screen; watch a TV show; try to sleep; wonder what the smell was (it was dinner).Long-haul fights are no longer fun, but this was as painless as possible. Flight attendants were efficient and civil. We got in early. De-planing was smooth and fast. What more could I ask for?Oh, the food. Not sure what it was, but it wasn't unpleasant."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,My new favourite airline,"Whoever has worked on the way Delta operates deserves a big payrise. The staff are all delightful, both at check-in and on the plane, the inflight entertainment is varied and very good, the food - for an airline - is excellent and the idea of a welcome cocktail is inspired. An absolutely lovely experience, I never want to cross the Atlantic with anyone else. (My recent flights were before the virus closed everything down,; I hope it will all be over soon so that I can fly with Delta again)."
Date of travel: April 2020,10,Last international reservation ever with Delta,"Usually I'll book international flights on one of the major European airlines but decided to give Delta a chance, just due to their price point. My parents were supposed to fly back on March 21 from PHX to DEL but the unfortunate COVID19 situation led to a string of cancellations. However, at a time when organizations are putting in extra effort to support customers, it looks like Delta isn't ready to compromise at all. The earliest my parents (senior citizens) are able to fly back home based on current regulations is on May 4 and while Delta cancelled our flights, the only options that were presented to us were either a 11 hour layover at London or get the next available flight in June! They are not even willing to book them on other flights being run by other airlines plainly due to ""company policies"" when they self contradicted themselves and gave us an American flight previously. Super frustrated with the time I've had to wait talking to their customer care agent Maria out of Dallas who was unable to provide any help and kept forcing her options onto us."
Date of travel: April 2020,10,Horrible,"They are taking $1000 from my family along with $200 per person for over 60 other people that were planning to attend our daughters wedding in Mexico next month. The resort is closed and the wedding is cancelled but somehow the working people are taking the loss instead of big greedy corporations!! Definitely would not recommend, and definitely will never travel through them again!! I will definitely be spreading the word to anyone I know!"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Spectacular Service During a Crisis,"My family and I flew on Delta Airlines at the onset of COVID-19 and we can not say enough about the excellent customer service that we experienced before, during and after our flights. The Delta crew did an amazing job of making us feel safe and comfortable. Delta took significant added precautions in sanitization and kept us informed through regular communications. I will remain a Delta Skymiles member for a very long time. THANK YOU DELTA FLIGHT CREW #167"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Unmatched in customer service,"A loyal Delta flier. My husband and I will never fly a different airline. they go above and beyond to ensure the best experience - Delta has my loyalty. We sat behind a passenger who was quite sick on the flight and the flight attendants managed to take full control of the situation, the sick passenger and all those effected without skipping a beat."
Date of travel: April 2020,20,"Delta Airlines- Quick to Accept a Taxpayer Supported Bailout, Slow to Refund Customers","For our seventieth birthday celebration my wife and I planned a trip to Italy and Greece. Our adult children and their families decided to join us. Our flight scheduled for May 14, 2020 to Rome and return June 3, 2020 from Milan can not be taken due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Our trip was made through American Express Travel using my American Express Gold Card I have had since becoming an Amex member in 1976. In speaking to American Express they had no help to offer. They booked the tickets nonrefundable which I was uanware of and strange considering I paid for the upgrade to Premium Economy.  When I contacted Delta about cancelling the flight they told me at best I could be provided a credit not a refund. If the flight is cancelled I can have a refund. At the moment Milan is on lockdown. Even if they open the airport in the next two weeks , who in their right mind would fly to a country as a high risk patient when their resources to provide care to their own is limited.  Delta was given a large Taxpayer generated financial bailout by Congress and the Trump administration. That $5000 airfare , when my smal business is closed due to the Covid Pandemic would go much further in our account than Delta'sI will say that the customer service representative I spoke to was knowledgable , helpful and sympathetic. She was just hampered by corporate policy"
Date of travel: January 2020,30,Round trip BOS --> Cancun,I flew in basic economy round-trip from Boston to Cancun in January 2020. My trip met my expectations. The staff was professional and the cabin was of standard cleanliness.
Date of travel: October 2019,20,not that good,"the seats were not that clean, cabin crews were not that nice and kind. costumer service was literally waste of time."
Date of travel: April 2020,10,Customer Service - Waste of Time,Customer service in 1 department will tell you something completely different than another department. Once they make you wait another half hour and speak to the other department they will tell you something different completely wasting your time. Then you go to the complaint section and require you to enter the flight number WHICH DOESNT EVEN WORK. I guess the company deals with complaints by not allowing them to be written.
Date of travel: April 2020,10,Horrible customer service,Because of the pandemic right now we had to cancel our flight and delta is not offering refunds only credits up to 2 years and the customer service when I called is Ridiculous and very rude. We don’t want to take a credit we want a full refund.
Date of travel: April 2020,10,Delta acts unethical in times of crisis!,"Delta is refusing to cancel a flight to Japan which has banned us travelers. Delta is doing this to subvert the DOT ruling on refunds for cancelled flights. Delta is issuing E-Credits which can be used later however will most likely raise prices on future flights forcing passengers to pay more for the same flights they originally had and would have taken. Delta is practicing malicious behavior towards US Passengers. Airlines are being bailed out, I am not! Delta should be forced to give a full refund to international travelers who have flights scheduled within a 2-3 month period while the pandemic is active and travel bans are in place. If Delta does not refund these types of passengers a class action law suit should be considered on behalf of USA Passengers. At the very least Delta should not issue credits but A voucher that guarantees the same seat and flight times if the passengers are choosing to fly to the same destinations at a later day. This would ensure that the passengers are not going to be taken advantage of and forced to pay more simply because Delta wanted to be unethical in how they handle their passengers during this crisis."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Great flight and pleasant crew!,"Our flight was at best 60% of capacity due to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe.  Our crew went above and beyond to make sure we felt very welcomed and taken care of.  As soon as we stepped onto the plane our children were each invited to take a seat in the cockpit!  This has never happened to us on even a domestic flight.  It was a very cool experience for them.All during the flight our crew was very attentive and did their best to make sure everyone had the items they needed.  Whenever it was meal or snack time, the crew often passed out seconds of extra items (even ice cream and drinks)!  I assume this was due to the decrease in passengers.There were plenty of entertainment options on this flight and overall the food was very good.  We even had Ben and Jerry's ice cream for desert.  Also, our flight attendant, Ibrahim, was very nice to our youngest daughter.  Near the end of the flight they passed out Toblerone candy bars to passengers.  When she showed excitement over the chocolate treat Ibrahim took note and before we buckled up for landing he returned and gave her an entire bag of candy bars!We would recommend this flight for anyone traveling to or through France.  It is a direct flight and you are only in the air for around 8 hours.  It is much shorter than most transatlantic flights.One tip if flying international from CVG (Cincinnati), you can't check in at the regular Delta desk, you have to go to the end counters labeled ""Special Services"".  It would have been nice to know this before we unloaded our eight bags in front of the regular desk."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Great flight! ,"While I was a bit hesitant to fly economy on such a long haul flight, I found the seats to be quite spacious and comfortable, inflight meals and entertainment was great, and the feature to keep track of my luggage took a lot of the anxiety away."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Delta managed to get me back to Bermuda On March 18th they were just wonderful unlike American who couldn't have cared,"I like  thousands of people were having trouble getting home. I had been on an NCL cruise which should have docked in San Juan on March 15th but was diverted to Port Canaveral on March 17th. NCL then provided coaches to get everyone to Orlando.  American had cancelled my flight to Bermuda & when I approached their Ageny who was extremely rude (I am Platinum & there were only 3 people in the Priority line) NEVER made any suggestions as to how I could get home.  Delta however, couldnt have been nicer and more helpful. I had lined up for 3 hours to get to one of their agents who assured me they would get me home. The crew on both flights MCO/BOS and BOS/BDA were incredible in fact they wrote me note saying what a pleasure it was having me on board. I have always been a great fan of American but after that display of unhelpfulness I've changed my loyalty."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Great Flight,"This was a great flight.  Flying out of Hartsfield is always great. PVR airport is a little different.  You exit the flight onto the tarmac  and board a bus to the terminal. The PVR is bigger than I thought and it is nice.  PLS KEEP UP WITH THE FORM FROM CUSTOMS AND AS YOU WILL NEED IT TO EXIT COUNTY OR HAVE TO PAY $30 USD TO GET  ANOTHER FORM. Also, when you exit to ground transportation the the room you walk thru is really time share people.  Keep walking to get outside to the actual ground transportation."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,New plane & very helpful cabin crew,Very clean. The flight was on time. Cabin crew went out of their way to be helpful & polite despite challenging times
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Smooth flight & able yo watch Movied Free during my 4 hr 34min Flight,"Won't fly any other Airline, Delta has the best reward miles available. The miles never expire. I actual  cashed in 26k of my miles for the round trip. Great service."
Date of travel: March 2020,20,Could not get my flight changed with plenty of seats available..,"We were scheduled to depart on the last flight at 2:50 PM and wished to change to either earlier flight, 12:10, 1:50 so that we would not miss connections.  Tried to phone and it was a six hour wait, held from 7AM until 11AM... sent family on their your while I tried to arrange the flights for the following day.  I drove to the airport as they would be able to use their computers to change the tickets as our computer would not allow changes.  Talked with agent for an hour and he promised he would call after he changed flights to either earlier flight.  NO call, NO change!!! There was NO help while overseas from DELTA with two first class tickets and two business class tickets and we told clerk we would accept any seat back earlier than our departure presently.  I did not like having zero help or communication from Delta."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Great service,"Traveled with Delta vacations.  I can't say enough good things about them.  Fantastic service, great people. super clean plane.  They handled all aspects of the trip so there was nothing to worry about."
Date of travel: January 2020,30,Just OK,Our flight was delayed by five hours and we were provided no explanation as to why until we were on the plane and about to take off. The service was pretty average. We also ordered vegan meals and were told they had none for dinner but it turned out for breakfast they had a meal for us. The selection of movies was good and the seats were just average comfort.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Great airline,Because of Covid 19 they changed my flights at no charge. Provided excellent service I would recommend them in a heartbeat. My preferred airline travelling to the USA anyway but this has cemented my opinion.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Cool under Chaos,"We Took flight 785 from Cabo To Minneapolis on Monday 3/23/2020. Seats 2c and 2d .We had to get out 5 days early due to the Covid:19 virus. There were a lot of very worried people on board. We all had to get out before the airport closing during the coming week.Some people thought they had been upgraded to first class but their boarding passes didn’t indicate that.  Apparently they didn’t look at their passes or were trying to pull a fast one.Some people in coach wouldn’t sit down and we couldn’t taxi. The flight attendant Patricia asked them several times to take their seats but they wouldn’t. Finally she went back to them and got them to sit. There was only one open seat in first.She remained cool and calm. She went to her iPad and after we took off got the issue resolved.I don’t know what caused the problem but Patricia resolved it and conducted herself very well. I would have blown up and probably got them kicked off.I am a million mile flier (probably closer to 2 million) and have never seen such a cool and efficient flight attendant. The other attendant,Michael, was calm and helpful as well.Thanks Delta for getting us home safely. We will be flying Delta again soon— we hope."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Delta during Corona Scare,Delta did not cancel flights like other airlines during this challenging time.  The flight crew was upbeat and professional.  Great experience!
Date of travel: September 2019,40,"First flight was not great, second flight was a lot better","So we flew from Dublin to Vegas via Atlanta - the first 9 hour flight to Atlanta was dreadful, the inflight entertainment system was ANCIENT but I guess it did have up to date movies. My headphone jack didn't work though so I couldn't watch anything, I had to listen to my partners movies instead after my tablet battery died.Sleepwise, not possible - I usually sleep on all planes but not this one.... seats were too uncomfortableThe food on the way to Atlanta was surprisingly nice, I had the spinach/ricotta pasta but the rest was basic. Free alcohol though made up for it slightly.Flying transatlantic again, I doubt I would choose Delta because of this flight.However, the flight from Atlanta to Vegas was a different world, the inflight entertainment was more up to date and had better movie choices (probably cos domestic flight?) but the seats were super cramped.... Check in/boarding was great though.The return journey was Vegas > JFK > Dublin with a 16 hour layover in JFK, we went into NYC but due to the inability to sleep on the red eye we were so tired in NYC, the holiday bookers made it sound like it was doable, but trust me, it's not!!I guess I can't complain TOO much considering the cheap flights I got.... (return flights were like £300pp)"
Date of travel: March 2020,10,They are ripping us off,"We were taking the whole family to Mexico for Spring vacation 4 grandchildren, 6 adults 10 in all.  This was a fee of about $10,000.  Of course the virus hit and they cannot take us to Mexico.  I want my money refunded.  It was not me who changed (read that canceled the reservations).  They tell us we had none refundable tickets.  Again It was Delta who canceled the flights.  I want all my money back.  We probably will take a trip once the virus is over and all is back to normal but you can bet it will not be somewhere where we have to fly Delta."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Premium economy,We had no join even to buy first class seats from Cartagena as those were the only ones left to purchase. The plane was a m88 from Atlanta to toronto which had no entertainment no wifi nothing. This is economy but they charge for first class but even the lounge wouldn’t allow us access. The water was undrinkable due to the age and lack of cleanliness. An airline shouldn’t be allowed to write and charge for a service that it is not isn’t this fraud?
Date of travel: March 2020,50,EXCELLENT SERVICE,"March 12, 2020 and Tampa International was packed. There was no line in Sky Priority at the ticket counter where we dropped off our luggage. Very friendly and professional gentleman checked us in. The Sky Club was a great refuge with a nice view from the second floor overlooking the concourse. Excellent and friendly staff there also. Boarded early and that is always a good sign. Our attendant was named Laurel and she turned out to be the best I have ever met. She was the first flight attendant who addressed us by our names. When I flew American that was normal but on the 13 trips in First Class with Delta it had never happened before. She was friendly in a true professional way. The flight was great and as we prepared to land she went to every person in First Class to thank us for our business. Very impressive. She is definitely an asset to Delta and should be recognized for her service."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Thank You Delta,"I was happy to board the last flight out of Bogota when the airport was about to close and after being ditched by Air Canada, you did your best to do my trip enjoyable. Thank you again"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Return from Italy,"On 18 Mar 2020, as infection and fatality rates from corona virus in Italy doubled and the US Government announced impending Level 4 travel restrictions, we contacted Delta Airlines about moving our return flight from Rome to the US from late May to the earliest available flight. They rebooked us on direct flights from FCO to JFK to SEA without any hassle or additional cost. Just before leaving Rome, we were notified that our flight from JFK to SEA had been cancelled but that we were automatically rebooked on a flight the following day. When we got to JFK we found out the FAA was cancelling flights due to shortages of ATC personnel. Food services at JFK had been severely curtailed. We found a very reasonably priced room and a convenient shuttle service to the Best Western-JFK Hotel. The next morning we caught our flight to Seattle and were home by noon. Today, Delta called to notify us that our hotel and meal expenses in New York were being reimbursed.The compassion and helpfulness of Delta’s worldwide customer service reps and counter personnel at JFK were extraordinary, especially given the stressful circumstances. Thank you Delta Airlines!"
Date of travel: March 2020,30,LAS to JFK before the reduced flight perid,Escaping from Las Vegas before the shutdown - Code share flight Virgin - operated by Delta.Lots of space in Delta+ and pleasant crew - but no food or drinks due to restrictions.Very good ground staff help in T4 at JFK to move between gates - a long way including by bus.
Date of travel: April 2019,40,Red eye flight with good service and amenitys.,We had our flight canceled due to the 737 max groundings on west jet for our return to Canada. And so we booked with delta airlines to fly to lax to yyc on west jet but we would fly delta from Maui to LA. We got to the airport and the lines were short and we got through check in easily. Security was a breeze and we were able to get dinner before going to our gateBoarding took forever with all of the zones but we got on eventually got on board and we were at the very back of a 757. The seat itself was comfortable and came with a pillow and blanket. My one complaint is my ife was completely inoperable. We got pushback eventually and got the sweet apu exhaust fumes goin. The aircraft itself was probably in the final days of its life and was very old and run down.Service was great the whole wayTo summarize this is a great airline and I highly recommend them
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Thank you Delta,This was when people were all freaked out about flying with the covid 19. Delta made my flight very enjoyable. Great customer service. They are now my goto airline! Thank you
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Excellent flight,Changed my flight to come home early and got to fly on a 777 with the Premium Select seats which were nice. These seats are like the original first class seats used internationally years ago by Delta with some upgrades. You can fully recline your seat without the possibility of making the passenger behind you mad. Lot's of space. They have a retractable leg rest and the television screen is much bigger that the largest domestic versions.Super comfortable flight all around!
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Delta review,Delta Airlines staff were friendly and helpful.It was my first time travelling with Delta but i would use them again.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Early Delta,Delta does a great job on this flight.  The attendants are always helpful  and great you when walking on the plane.  I have flown this direction and also from DSM to ATL and also have had the same experience .  The flights going both ways have always arrived early.  One too early and we had to wait for another plane to move out of the way.Delta does a good job on this flight!
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Shameful and disgraceful decision making,"My mother just recently passed away two days ago from COVID-19. She got sick and was gone in three days. My wife has spent two straight days, hours and hours, making arrangements because my mother's only real wish was that she get buried next to my brother in New York. We were booked on a Delta flight leaving Los Angeles at 9 PM.At 5:30 PM the afternoon of the flight Delta decides to cancel the flight and rebook us on a 6 AM flight the next morning.  They knew that they were carrying someone’s remains on that flight. The kind of in sensitivity and disgraceful behavior on the part of Delta to put profits before people and customers is mind-boggling in this situation. All of our plans for burying my mother properly and with dignity in these very difficult times was blown up because they were not going to make enough of a profit on this flight. This is an absolute disgrace. My mother's body now sits at LAX alone waiting to see whether she will get the proper burial she deserves. Delta has no right ever claiming that they put their customers and people before anything but the shareholders and their corporate executives."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,"Thank you, Delta","In a time when there is so much uncertainty it is  comforting to fly with an airline that values its customers. Not only do they say thank you many times, the service (even in economy) is excellent. I also found the announcements very informative. They told us what we would be encountering when arrived in the US. Information that I couldn’t find on the web. I really appreciated the kind and friendly staff!"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Delightful Trip,The plane was lovely and the staff delightful. Service was efficient and the flight departed and arrived on time.  A very pleasant trip.
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Yet Another Great Experience,"Big fan of Delta!  Flying out of FLL it's the ONLY way to go!!  Delta's terminal is SO compact & easy to navigate.  The baggage drop line was long but moved super fast. My only complaint was that the attendant at the baggage drop was not very friendly.  She didn't confirm our destination.  I had to verify with her that she was sending our bags to the correct place.  She didn't bother to tell us our gate number either!  Our flight boarded & left on time.  As usual these days, the flight was full, but for the short flight, it was comfortable enough.  Huge variety of onboard entertainment. Snacks were the usual cookies or crackers.  Baggage was already on the carousel at ATL by the time we got there."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Vacation,"This airlines has a very good service in domestic and international fly services, compare to the others airlines I think is the best in the United States , I’ve traveled to many cities and many countries, Two weeks ago we fly from London to jfk Ny they were taken care to all passengers they were very organized."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Wonderful!,First time a pilot approached my son and made him feel welcomed and at ease. It really made his day!
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Coronavirus credit from Delta having used justfly to buy ticket,"I originally purchased my tickets on justfly for a non refundable ticket. Since I needed to cancel my flight, justfly.com offered to handle it for me for $75 each way. OMG. Given that Delta was offering credits through their website, I can't imagine what justfly thought that was reasonable. I waited as requested by Delta's online coronavirus response to be closer to my flight departure day. I then went on their site and easily canceled my flight for a credit I will have to use before the end of the year. Delta was easy and reasonable. Justfly was not."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Great communication,"The plane was comfortable, staff was very friendly.  Most importantly, we were made aware of delays and updates in a timely fashion."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Infection Control Suggestion,"I loved flying with Delta and they are great as always.  Just coming from a health care professional, it would be a great idea to incorporate showing the passengers the correct way to cover their cough or sneeze (during the initial greeting via flight attendant), and that’s near your elbow, not in your hand, because that’s the number one way for someone to spread their germs on everything they touch."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,A Great Experience,The Entire Staff Was Amazing .  From the time we boarded until we got off the plane the staff was keeping the entire plane laughing and entertained .It took the edge off the current situation we are in at this time .
Date of travel: March 2020,30,Disappointing,"Put in last row. No room especially when passenger in front reclined his seat. Stewardess was rude. I also find it disconcerting to have to pay for luggage, yet many come to the gate and then check luggage for free. Exorbitant luggage fees"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Never had an issue,"Good service never and issue with Delta, they changed our flight dates and helped us get back to Australia after our cruise was cancelled.  Thank you guys"
Date of travel: January 2020,40,"Easy and Quick Flight, but Ground Delays in CDMX","Delta and its partner AeroMexico generally offer the most humane flights between NYC and Mexico City. There are decent in-flight services, a solid selection of entertainment. Aside from ground delays in Mexico City, everything was smooth and easy."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,"Non-refundable canceled flight, credit with expiration date - Watch out for Delta!","I bought tickets from Seattle to Heathrow on February 3 for a April 9th flight, which has been canceled for, well everyone knows why. Delta has refused to refund my tickets, even though it is unclear when I will be able to travel. Instead, they have issued virtually useless credit, which expires - guess when??? One year after the ticket purchase date, not even one year after the cancellation. I will do anything to avoid this company in the future. Thanks for nothing!"
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Very comfortable overnight flight,"We left late, it would have been nice if ground personell had informed us about that early to allow for a dinner in the airport. The flight, dinner, service was excellent as could be expected and very comfortable. I travel this connection regularly, and got the upgrade to first class through a special offer. Being able to ly down for a couple of hours makes all the difference!"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Superb during a crisis,"Haven't flown Delta in quite a while but booked trip from Boston to Fort Meyers dart on  3/1 return on 3/31First Class. (Treat). Wanted to return home early called Delta and they returned my call in TEN HOURS.At first they wanted to offer no change fee but I asked them to honor my original fare and after speaking with supervisor, they agreed and ticketed us 3/17. Arrived at Fort Meyers Airport; no lines; got to gate; gate agent was the best ever; all passengers were calm; boarded; flight attendants and pilots were relaxed and home we went. Arrived in Boston; bags arrived quickly; got in car and arrived home! Whew..."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Better than told,"Good flight, bumpy ride, quick boarding and deplaning.The phone app is perfect, great design and easy access to seat change and extra needed info."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,"smooth flight, but they could have allowed people use the business class seats as the flight was empty","Flight was smooth, bumped to comfort+ before boarding. the flight had approx 30 people on it.  it took a while to get comfortable in the seat and they wouldnt allow us use the business class seats to have a sleep even though the flight was empty"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Delta (and Juan - the Customer Service Rep) worked hard to get me home,"My aged Father and I were returning to Seattle, from New Delhi. Our original flight on Cathay Pacific had been cancelled and we rebooked with Delta and Korean Air. That flight was also cancelled. At 2 in the morning on February 27, I waited 1 hour on hold, but the wait was worth it. Juan worked for the next hour, to find a way to get us home quickly and safely. The staff in both New Delhi and Incheon we wonderful and helpful in getting my father his wheelchair and Incheon Airport was an impressive place to spend 3 hours. There have been many reschedules, many changes I have had in my travels... but Delta and their customer service really went the extra mile in these trying time."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,great service as flights were beginning to get chaotic,"first class only because I got upgraded.  Timely departure, great service on board.  Baggage was quick to arrive."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Best airline ever,Thank you delta airlines for never failing me ! During this corona virus outbreak we had to cancel our vacation in April . Less then five min on hold to reach customer service and everything was taken care of perfectly :) thank you for being the best airline that I have traveled with for the last 10 years . YOU ROCK
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Great Flight - Not So Great Airport,"In route to San Diego, I took Delta IND-LAX-SAN. The flights were great - friendly gate agents and flight attendants and both flights were on time. While I normally use the IND-LAX to get me to the west coast, regardless of final destination, LAX is in the midst of a multi-year billion dollar overhaul. Getting between terminals is a nightmare and getting anything to eat is a huge challenge. Because of the bus service that has been installed between terminals, doors are constantly open. The morning I went through there it was very windy and barely 50 degrees, so it was very unpleasant for my two hour layover. Stick with Delta, but I suggest either Salt Lake City or Minneapolis as a pivot point to San Diego."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,"Thank Goodness for Delta, my hometown airlines, during a Pandemic Crisis","I needed to take a minute to process what is happening in our world and what my family just experienced with our spring break trip to Punta Cana, Dominican Republic.  Now granted things in our world were already changing at a pretty fast pace but we still felt comfortable taking our senior on his spring break trip with his 2 friends.  We used Delta Vacation to book our trip through a travel agent and off we went to Punta Cana on March 13th.  All was well and we were having a lovely time.  By Tuesday, March 17th, things began to change by the minute.  We checked in with our travel agent to ensure that we were still safe to be on our trip and that our flights home were still a go for Saturday.  She was very reassuring and said she'd monitor the situation for us with Delta so we could go on enjoying our trip.  Wednesday was more of the same but all was still going as planned.  By Thursday we were getting nervous as we started to hear rumblings that our resort was going to shut down and the country was going to close the airports.  Again we were reassuered the Delta had us covered and they were assuring all passengers that noone would get left behind.  We were unable to move up our flights as all were full but they again assured us that our flight was a go.  I can't tell you how comforting it was to know that Delta was my airline and we were going to get home ok.  I never doubted their commitment to their customers and was actually really proud to say it was my hometown airlines.  All around us we watched and heard horror stories of airlines cancelling flights with no notice to customers and basically abondoning them to their own devices to get home.  American Airlines  and United Airlines I'm talking about you!   Families traumatized and stressed to the high heavens as they tried to figure out how to get out of the country.  In a lot of cases Delta actually stepped in and took their airlines credits and booked them out on a Delta flight instead.  On Saturday as we flew out of Punta Cana, on time I might add, it was so comforting to get on that familiar plane with a wonderful staff and head home.  The pilot even addressed all of us as we were landing and wished us luck and told us to stay safe.  Truly can say that I won't be flying other airlines if I can help it in the future.  DELTA ALL THE WAY!"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,World class service from Delta!,We had a very pleasant experience flying with Delta. From rescheduling flights because of the present situation to the service onboard they went well above and beyond the call of duty. They were truly outstanding.Thank you Delta!
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Delta did a great job,"Flew with Delta on March 9 from ALB to MSY via Atlanta...significantly lower traffic  and ~50% seat occupancy...pretty expected with the current situation.  I was supposed o fly back on the 13th, but due to personal circumstances had to reschedule. While the in-person call center was down, but the online system was up and robust and allowed me to reschedule  6 hours before flight. It was very stressful but I am thankful to Delta IT team for their robustness. I understand this change came during the EU flight ban, so pretty much it was doomsday for them. Thanks again !"
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Smooth & accommodating,"Bigger plane and had free movies, tv, news on the screen.  Seats still need more legroom as my 6'3"" husband's knees were into the seat in front.  Also, boarding was nice as he was in a wheelchair with a broken ankle and they got him on board with no problems.  thank you."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Amazing Flight,"With everything that is going on at this time with COVID-19, I must say JFK airport and Delta airlines did everything within their power to make check-in go smoothly and the flight pleasant. I haven’t flew Delta in years, however they will be one of my top airlines to fly."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Delta flight from Vegas to Hilton Head island,"Delta is amazing!When you fly Delta you feel like you are in good hands and all is well.Delta gives snacks and drinks- refreshing - who does that anymore!My trip was decent priced as I booked through Expedia.The neatest thing was in-flight entertainment - loved it!I watched a movie, a new movie.The flight back to Vegas I logged into trivia channel and had a ball.Cannot recommend Delta enough!A must fly airline!Keep climbing Delta!Thanks"
Date of travel: March 2020,40,New Upscaled Dining in Economy a fail,"First experience with the upgraded economy class dining on some of their international routes and honestly there are some nice touches (menu and disposable place mats) but in the end it's all about the food and it remains as inedible as before.  The choices are as expected limited.  They did offer a complimentary drink which I guess some people liked.  We were in row 31 and by the time they got to us, they were out of the shrimp appetizer (as the attendant said, they run out of those by the sixth row - well perhaps they should learn something and plan for more).   The entrees were terrible and even the roll was hard.  Best think was the ice cream.  So good try Delta, but still a long way to go.  Will continue to bring my snacks in fear of starving.  Seats were pretty good.  Entertainment was good.  Bathrooms were filthy (not Delta's fault but passengers are just pigs when they get in the air - would be nice if Delta cleaned them occasionally though).  One of the attendants was a hoot and engaged the passengers.  Others were just there to do their job.  Typical."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Excellent Service,"From the time we entered the airport we were met by attendants with wheel chairs since we asked for assistance. They took us to the head of the line to check our bag and took charge of our carry-on luggage. They stopped at the rest rooms and then took us right to the gate where handicapped seating was designated.The flight left on time and arrived early. Flight attendants had a variety of snacks and drinks. They distributed earphones to access the latest movies. The flight was faultless, and we were met at the jetway by attendants who also allowed us a rest stop, retrieved our bag, and took us right to the departure entrance to meet our limo driver."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,ON Time wit a friendly crew,Boarded on time with the usual friendly greeting. After seating was served a nice hot cup of coffee. It was a fairly windy day so there were a few adjustments in elevation to find the smoothest fight path. Lunch was excellent and so were the smacks that we received during this trip.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Excellent service,My connected flight was cancelled due to COVID-19 and they put me on a flight that landed only an hour later AND put me in first class when I was in basic economy on the flight that got cancelled. I’m really grateful because this was a family emergency that I needed to be home and I couldn’t appreciate it more.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Very good service,All our flights were good.  I enjoy the 757 layout with the main entry behind business class.  The food was good the service was friendly and prompt and all four flights arrived early.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Delta surpassed our expectations,"Delta Airlines was exceptional in coordinating our early return from Quito to Winnipeg during the Coronavirus epidemic. With borders closing all over the world, Delta took our call and accommodated us in getting a full credit to fly back on a flight two weeks earlier than our original booked flights. Although we had to wait over an hour on the phone, the ability of Delta to accommodate our needs during this difficult period was exceptional. All we would like to say is THANK YOU DELTA for getting us back home in a safe and timely manner!"
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Vegas,Entire experience was smooth and staff at gate and onboard aircraft was professional and attentive. TSA CLEAR PreCheck is GREAT!!!!
Date of travel: March 2020,50,always on time and pleasant,"stewardess was nice and made sure that everyone had what they needed and was very friendly. pilot made sure he announced any turbulence, time remaining in flight and made sure to thank everyone for flying delta."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,"Short, smooth flight to Charlotte","Short flight, less than 2 hrs from JFK to CLT. Flight boarded and left on time. Plane was practically empty due to Covid-19. There were about 2 dozen passengers. Flight attendants gave us extra snacks, told us we could spread out anywhere after the safety briefing, and were pleasant throughout the flight."
Date of travel: March 2020,30,In flight entertain did not work on 8 hr flight,"Flew in Premium Select Plus (a P class ticket that’s supposed to be discounted first class or a business class product). We had a dedicated flight attendant, Jason, who was absolutely fantastic. The seats in Premium Select recline and have a foot rest but they aren’t lay flat seats. That was fine since we were flying during the day anyway. Premium Select Plus is a small section located between Delta One and Main Cabin Economy. Our meals were served on real plates and we had a more extensive alcohol and non-alcohol menu than economy class.My only complaint was that my in-flight entertainment did not work for the entire 7+ hour flight to JFK. The screen was frozen the entire time and I couldn’t even turn it off. I asked Jason for it to be shut off and was told individual screens couldn’t be shut off. So when the cabin lights were dimmed, my frozen screen was glaring brightly in my face. I was able to use the plane’s WiFi and use my iPad to watch a couple of movies. At the end of the flight, I was offered 5000 miles for the inconvenience of not having a working IFE. I gave Jason my Skymiles info but I have yet to see those miles in my account. It’s only been 3 days so I’ll give it a week before contacting Delta. Overall the flight had no issues - turbulence was minimal, service was quick and the FAs were all pleasant despite having to work in the middle of a pandemic - but having a broken IFE during a long haul flight was annoying."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Good on time flights,Good on time flights both coming and going.  Was able to get exit row seats on both flights.   Good friendly flight crews.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Yearly retreat to Lauderdale,I was very impressed with Delta this year. Both departures were on time and the staff appeared very professional and organized. Both planes were clean an in good condition.  I appreciate what a good job they are doing.  In the past is appeared that stewards/stewardess were getting a bit sloppy looking and not very attentive to their guests.  I did not experience any of this.  Keep up the good work.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great airline!,"Excellent flight Monterrey – Greenville (via Atlanta). My aircraft (4) were mostly new, except for 1. Monterrey to Atlanta (round) is the longest, around 3 hours and everything was very good, the shortest one Atlanta to Greenville is around 50 minutes, so they don’t even have time to offer you snacks or beverages.  Seat: one of the best that I can remember, very comfortable, with enough space for the legs. In-flight entertainment: excellent. Very good quality on the screens, the sound, the movies and TV shows available were simply perfect.  Onboard experience: everything was very good, good attention from the flight attendants. Customer Service: I did not have to use it. Value for money: ok. Cleanliness: very good, in very good conditions.  Check-in and boarding: everything without issues. Food and beverage: average."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Terrible online credit card experience,I don't normally write reviews but I think this will bring awareness to the situation and effect policy changes in the future. Buying a ticket for someone abroad genuinely is too much of a headache in the name of stoping FRAUDULENT buyers.After paying for the flight the policy is to show up at the airport/delta office where ever they are to very your credit card and ID by a Delta Agent. In my case that meant driving 2hours 30mins to the airport paying $18 in tolls and $12 for parking = $30 amidst state shutdown because of coven19. I strongly belief there are better ways to do this and do it well online with out the extra cost and lost of work hours.
Date of travel: December 2019,30,"Not much of an upgrade from Greyhound, but a lot faster","They left the airport as promised.  They arrived as scheduled. Crew was nothing to write home about, nor to write the CEO.  Wheels up to touchdown was about 40 minutes.  We arrived safely.  No incidents.As for cabin service, you could have hot coffee or 6 oz of room temperate water .  There was some kind of cookie.  For an airline based in Atlanta one would think they would offer you a Coke.  They claimed they did not have time for that.Has Customer Service in Corporate America reached the point the goal is simply not to end up in court?"
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Mechanical Defects from hell,"This was the worst flight ever. I have been a loyal Delta Customer for several  years, but this experience has shaken that loyalty.To make matters worse, our flight from Greensboro to San Juan at the beginning of our vacation was delayed due to a mechanical problem as well. Even though we were able to race to the gate in Atlanta arriving about 5 minutes after the scheduled time for departure, Delta did not hold the flight for us or any other passengers making the connection.  We missed the connecting flight in Atlanta and were rerouted to San Juan via JFK in NYC!!! Instead of arriving at 2 in the afternoon, we arrived at 8 PM at night missing a half day of our vacation. But back to the awful experience of Flight 599 that was scheduled to leave San Juan at 3:20 in the afternoon on 2/29/20.  We boarded the plane on time. Then people noticed a liquid dripping from the right wing. Soon thereafter the pilot came on the intercom and explained that there is a value under each wing that is used to drain water from fuel tanks. He said, ""Nothing to worry about, Water is heavier than fuel oil and migrates to the bottom of the tank. ""  However, a short while later, we were told that they decided to drain the fuel in the right wing and transfer it to the left wing.  This process created a small risk of fire so we had to exit the plane.  So we all exited this big plane which took about 25 minutes.As we crowded against the windows in the concourse, we saw men in hazmat suits and fire engines around the plane. It did not look good. More time went by and we were told that the valve was broken and needed to be replaced. Some people used their phones to try and book alternative flights with little success. Friends with whom we were traveling were able to book a later flight from Atlanta to Greensboro when it became obvious that we would not make the original connecting flight. I tried but was unable to rebook our Atlanta connecting flight.As it was getting close to dinner time, snacks and drinks were brought out for us. This seemed like a good idea at the time but in hindsight, it was not.   About 6:30 or 7 PM we were told that there was not a replacement valve in San Juan. One would have to be flown over from Atlanta. about a 3 hour flight. Our estimated time of departure at that point was maybe 10 PM. They then brought out sandwiches, but we were never offered a meal voucher. I, like many people, had eaten too many unhealthy snacks. I wish we were offered the sandwiches or a meal voucher initially.The pilot was very gracious and apologetic. He did his best to keep us informed. About 8 or 8:30 PM he told us that his crew's time was up and a whole new crew had to be found and flown from Atlanta to San Juan. He strongly encouraged us to stay with the flight. Although some people were rebooking flights for the next day. The pilot assured us that many people would greet the plane in Atlanta and have connecting flights information and, if necessary, hotel vouchers for us.The new expected time of departure became 12:30 am Sunday morning. While waiting for our flight to depart, I was able to book a flight from Atlanta to Greensboro Sunday morning at 8:30 am. We were upgraded to first class which we appreciated. We didn't depart San Juan until after 1 am Sunday morning. When we arrived in Atlanta there was one person at the gate. It was about 4:30 am. She was surly and worthless. She knew nothing about connecting flights or hotel vouchers. All she could tell all of us was ""go to the front of the airport.""  I have transferred planes in Atlanta numerous time, but I have never checked in at Atlanta, like most of the people on our plane. I did not know how to find ""the front of the airport.""  She could have said to ride the train to a certain stop, but NO"" all she said was ""Go to the front of the airport.""  I was not familiar with that term. She answered no questions. So we, along with everyone else, got on the tram and rode it to the last stop. As we took the escalator up, we realized we were leaving the security area. When we found the Delta counter it was about 5 am. There were, I think, three staff people behind the counter. Since we were in ""Comfort+ seats"" on the fight to Atlanta, we were one of the first to arrive at the counter. They knew nothing about our flight's delay. They were totally unprepared to be inundated by a host of upset customers. They knew nothing about hotel vouchers. They didn't know which hotels in the area would accept vouchers.  They had to call their supervisor. The bottom line was they strongly discouraged us from asking for a hotel voucher.   They could not give us meal vouchers.So what we had been told would await us in Atlanta did not happen.  Delta really let us down.  So we got our boarding passes for the 8:30 am flight to Greensboro. We had to stand in lines to go through security at about 5:30 am on little or no sleep. That was no fun at all. But we finally made it back to Greensboro safe and sound.  But very disgruntled with Delta."
Date of travel: March 2020,20,Real rough flight,"When we got on the plane, no blankets or pillows were available . The flight attendant told us that nobody put them on the plane.No water was at our seats as is customary in business class and I had to request it.The flight itself was unusually rough as we flew into a 115 mile headwind the entire flight. Before our meal,  no hot hand towels were given out for us to wash our hands.The flight attendant seemed always preoccupied.I expected better service in business class for the price it cost me."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Always have great time and excellent service with Delta. Best airline!!,I always have great experience flying with Delta. Their customer service is top-notch. Seats are more comfortable than most airlines. Free upgrade to Comfort + multiple times even though I don't fly that often. You can't go wrong with Delta when flying in the US.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,My Airline!,I almost always fly Delta. They just do business better than others! They are good at keeping you updated and also very friendly.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Good flights,"The flights and connections all went well. The plans were for and clean. Even though the seats were close, they were still fairly comfortable for the 3 1/2 hour flight."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Great Service!,I was able to make the necessary changes to my flights due to Corona Virus Protocol very easily! Delta was great at communicating and keeping me informed. The flight and service were great!
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Great Flight,Great flight with plenty of food and snacks! Unlike other airlines that I have taken for international travel.
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Excellence marred by ineptitude,"Both the flights, to & from were professionally completed. Boarding was pleasant and on time.  The arrival time of both flights was actually slightly early (a pleasant surprise). However The plane was filthy. I have a picture of one armrest...  ugh! Whoever is in charge of ensuring the planes are clean should be fired. They should not be allowed to tarnish an otherwise wonderful flight."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Wonderful Delta Experience as  Usually,We had a great flight to and back to Ft. Myers Our flight crew was very professional and attentive to our needs.
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Overall a great experience,Our Delta flight down was full of unexpected surprises. In flight movie selection was amazing. All of us watched something different. Great staff with multiple services offered. Great experience all around. Flight home was met with rude & grumpy flight attendants. What a difference a smile & good attitude makes. Staff sat in back three rows eating left over 1st class meals and on their phones.   Still gave it 4 stars because of how good the flight down was.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Top Airline in my book,Clean and comfortable and on time.  Great start to a Vacation.  Enough room to sleep comfortable on a red eye.
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Delta Works Hard,Delta is very consistent with good service in all areas of service. They work hard at taking care of everyone on board.
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Amazing Staff at the Gates,"My fiancé and I were late to the airport, as it was an extremely early flight. We got to the gate right after they closed the doors on the plane. Once the doors were closed on the plane, they cannot re-open them. This meant we had missed our flight by 5 minutes!Luckily, the staff were amazing. They rushed to find the next flight with the shortest layovers / connections. They were able to find us a plane that routed through Minnesota and only got is in 2 hours later than expected! They didn't even charge us for the switch, even though we were Basic Economy. Overall, it was a great experience and the staff at the gate were wonderful.However, one last thing in regard to accessibility -> There is no subtitles option on the TVs in the plane that I was on. While this is not a problem for me, it could be for many. Pretty low-hanging fruit for Delta to fix to create a better and comprehensive  experience for everyone!"
Date of travel: July 2019,40,good comfort,the Delta air lines offers a good quality comfort for a reasonable price. Staff is friendly and helpful ! Hot meals are not so delicious.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Love Delta!!!,"I have flown with Delta over 20 times round trip and I absolutely cannot brag about them more! I’ve flown business class and economy. This is a fantastic airline, they have newer planes, all of their flight attendants have been more than accommodating and are super friendly (it is like you can tell that the company really does a great job of taking care of their employees first and recognizes what they do well), they make you feel like you’re a super guest (no matter what section you are sitting in), they have a user friendly app that is truly all you need in hand when you go through the airport, amazing customer service, and then some. They often arrive early to the destination and they are down to business as far as getting people on and off of planes. Of all of the flights I’ve taken with Delta, maybe two were delayed, but they got me on the next flight both times and it was only 30 minutes later than the original booked one. I absolutely, BY FAR, recommend this airline for everyone!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"great service, great flight","Great flight, clean plane, an empty seat next to me. I will fly with Delta again. The staff did a great job of serving and making you feel welcome."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Above and beyond excellent service,"Excellent customer service! My flight from the Bahamas came in early, and I was scheduled to wait three hours in Boston. I noticed another fight to Raleigh-Durham that was slightly delayed. I inquired if I could be switched to this earlier flight--to arrive at 7:30 instead of 10:30. Although I did not have a flexible ticket, a supervisor made the switch. I was able to reach my hotel by 8pm, which gave me enough time to switch rooms and stop at a Target for some supplies. THANK YOU Delta for going above and beyond to help me out."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,From Canada to USA,"Delta as always, was very friendly, professional and polite but had to deny boarding because it was less than 14 days since I had traveled back from Italy, even though I had documentation showing I was tested negative for Covid19"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Great Service! Good job on new meals! Need to Update the 767s,"I like Delta and their service but their older 767s must be updated! The seats are old and not comfortable, the carpet looks like my grandmothers and the entertainment system is very used and needs updating. The tray table was off center and the bathrooms need to be updated too. The service was perfect and the meals not bad for an airline. They are really trying to improve and I notice it each flight I take!  The signature cocktail in a plastic cup was odd and probably something to do away with.  I hoe Delta weathers the COVID storm as they are the best airline out there!"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Return flight from vacation,"Delta employees were diligent in boarding and aircraft cleanliness. We did sanitize our seat area, vents, movie screen. I did not see a lot of others doing that tho. Before boarding, security did ask when our last trip to China was.  Never!!!!!  Distribution of snacks the steward used gloves. Garbage went in the bag shortly after it was handed out. This was March 11"
Date of travel: March 2020,40,"Very good service, despite corona virus outbreak!","This was one of the last flights out of the US to Europe due to the travel-ban inacted in the US. For this reason, no pillows or blankets were provided. However, the plane was very clean and the flight staff provided thorough information at the beginning of our flight. Due to fewer passengers on this flight, I enjoyed a few hours sleep as I had 3 seats in the middle section of the plane for myself. Overall, I enjoy flying with Delta. Their improved dining experience and updated entertainment system are also very nice and appreciated."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Pleasant flight from GA to TX and back,"Had a one stop over flight in Atlanta and then on to San Antonio.  Scheduling was great and all went well.  No issues with the flight at all.  On the return trip, we were able to schedule the same one stop over in Atlanta but  the second leg of the trip was 50 minutes after scheduled landing time.  As luck would have it, we had to run from one side of the airport to the other to catch our connecting flight to Savannah.  We made it as they were boarding.  With the current situation, many people had cancelled their flights and there was lots of room on the flight even though it had originally been booked solid"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Love flying with Delta!!,It was a great flight!!  Delta is always my choice and I'm never disappointed!! The food was very good and the crew fantastic!!
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Pleasant and efficient,"The flight from Columbia to Atlanta was on one of those little commuter aircraft so it gets the job done, but not terribly comfortable.  The flight from Atlanta to Tucson was good.  No meals served unless you want to buy from their limited menu, but drinks and snacks are provided.  Video is outstanding."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Excitement,"I fly quite often domestically for work, occasionally for leisure, but boarding the flight to London made my wife and I quite giddy. It had been 21 years since we made the last trip across the pond.We chose Delta due to having sky miles and also because we are big Delta fans.The flight attendants were terrific, they could tell we were very excited to make the trip with them which is routine but you wouldn't know it the way they seemed to enjoy and interact with the passengers. Our flight was aboard a 767-300 which was very comfortable and quite quiet actually, allowing us to take a nap.Our return flights were mirror image of the outbound leg.The same level of service and comfort."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"Excellent Flight, equipment, and Service","Delta has picked up their game and consistently delivers a 5-STAR experience on every flight. I am the type of customer that I demand a company provides great service. Over the years I traveled for business and at one time back in the 1990's I flew Delta regularly. Delta had more misses than not and I moved to US Air who provided me with exceptional service every time I flew. Delta has come back and really picked up their game. The level of customer service from booking to gate crews to cabin crews has gone into overdrive. Delta is now my number one choice when we fly. This recent flight was spectacular. The aircraft was spotless and comfortable. The in-flight entertainment options for Free through the seatback devices are top-notch. Our flight was a 757 and completely full. The boarding process leaving Atlanta was flawless, efficient and quick. Our flight crew did an amazing job of providing in-flight service. The range of amenities offered is again, best in the industry. Our direct flight to Roatan, Honduras was exceptional and Delta has done everything right to earn and win my loyalty back. The Skymiles program is the best loyalty program out there and with their Delta Amex it cannot be beat."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"Trouble free, ontime, and services as it should be","Our expectations for air travel were completely met; nothing spectacular, just what it needs to be. Premium economy gives additional space, and this is a big plus, worth the additional cost"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Continued excellence,"Round trip right before things shut down. Plane full both ways. Plane clean. Service excellent on all segments. Food service was good, but I feel sometimes too much of attempt at gourmet when my wife and I would prefer simple  pilots interacted with people before flight and they were very friendly. Consistently good feel on this airline."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,JFK to LHR,"I had been on three other delta flights on this trip and several others previously.This flight was so much better than the others that were only ok.This one was a partnership with Virgin and the Delta version of Premium Economy was as good as the Virgin one.Very comfortable, great tv entertainment and fantastic service."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Flight Attendants,Our flight with Delta to and from Philadelphia was very good. We had great weather and the pilots kept us informed throughout our flights. The only issue I had was with a ticket agent in the Atlanta airport. I stood inside the gangway waiting on my husband and she told me I had to keep moving and got very rude with me about it. I did not know I could not wait on him there was no need for her to raise her voice to me. I said ok and continued to move along. Aside from this I truly enjoy Delta.
Date of travel: March 2020,30,Very nice flight,The crew was very nice. I had lots of room since the plane wasn’t that full. I would recommend them to anyone.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Good flight,"Our flight was on time and check in was a breeze. Even the refund for baggage fee I didn't need was painless. Thanks, Delta."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"On time, pleasant flight, no service though.","Flew from Atlanta to Jamaica.  No issues at all.  There was turbulence coming and going and they provided no service for the safety of the flight attendants.  They did offer water.  The one think I don't like about delta is they charge you for EVERYTHING such as window seats, bulkhead seats, priority boarding.  Kind of nickel and dime you."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Great customer service,The service on the way down and back was great .  Delta staff were super pleasant and professional.   I would definately  fly with them again.The only downside was how dirty the bathrooms were.  This was at the beginning of the flight.
Date of travel: March 2020,10,"Lost baggage, counter lady abrupt and so unmannerly.","Flying from New York to Orlando for our second part of our holiday, and delta lost one of our bags, with all my cloths in to change into for the hotter weather, so off to the lost baggage counter, waited in line with other people, as it must be a regular occurrence, to be met by a rude, matter of fact, unmannerly woman, I’ve always been of the opinion if you don’t like your job, change it, she should have change hers years ago, very very rude, we got to watch her in action a couple of times, so it wasn’t just us."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Wonderful First Class Experience,"I recently flew to NYC to visit my son. I got the flight with points, so I splurged and paid to upgrade to first class. Despite this being a short flight, it was wonderful to be able to board first and relax with a drink while everyone else boarded. It was our flight attendant's birthday and she was very sweet!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Best Customer Service....ever!,"I flew Delta (actually SkyWest) from Salt Lake to Missoula on a Sunday afternoon. As were were arriving at Missoula there was heavy turbulence and, when looking out the window, extremely limited visibility; it was worrisome. Eventually the pilot diverted to Livingston, ID; a great and appreciated decision. It seems however, the airport at Livingston is closed on Sundays. Nothing open, no services and (because TSA wasn't there) nobody was to be allowed back on the plane if they decided to get off. Fortunately there were some SkyWest employees training when we arrived. These great people rallied and ""worked"" our airplane. They called for the off-duty fuel guy to come in and brought snacks to us. Kudos to all. The crew was fantastic, frequent communication to keep us informed...and they worked a medical emergency at the same time. Eventually we took off and landed in Missoula. I give the biggest KUDOs to the crew and airport workers. Job very well done."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Always Delta,"It's hard to get a nonstop from Myrtle to Detroit. They all want to connect you through Atlanta. No thanks! Delta had a direct flight, albeit on a smaller plane, that saved me time and money. No seat back video, but otherwise the same as the bigger jets. I will only fly Delta."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Flying with Coronavirus concern,"Flight was full and was a normal flight despite the current concerns.  We wore N95 face masks and were surprised how few people were wearing masks.  Service was adequate, but not of the caliber expected for first class.  Flight was smooth, but had some bumpy spots."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,In the midst of crisis Delta proved strong and dependable,"Our flight was cancelled due to shutdown of Paris and entry into the US.  We had a couple hours of panic , and then heard from Delta that we were re-routed through Atlanta.   I was thankful Delta took care of us.  At the gate, on the plane, baggage all were up to Delta service.   We felt it was almost “normal”.  Thank you Delta for serving us in a very hard time with professionalism, courtesy, and great service."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Flight to Reno,Flight and service were good.  One minor glitch with screen on outbound flight.  The screen did not function so I was unable to listen to mucic or watch any video.Food was very good.  I appreciated that fish was offered as a entree on the return trip as it was a Friday in Lent.  This indicates to me that the company is attune to the needs of its costumers.
Date of travel: March 2020,40,On Time Under Tough Circumstances,"Our leaving flight Feb 23 actually originated at GSP (Greenvile-Spartanburg SC) which was garden variety both ways, but the international flights were Delta 84 from ATL to CDG (Paris) and Delta 83 CDG to ATL.  Both flights left and arrived  on time and were comfortable.  My only real complaint is that the plane on the flight to Paris was old and the touch-screen on the InFlight entertainment system on the seat in front of me did not work, so the InFlight entertainment was WORTHLESS.  Three different flight attendants apologized and said that they would ""reset"" the system and I believe that they tried, but to no avail.  I eventually came to believe that they already knew that ""resetting"" it wouldn't work but thought that I would give them credit for trying.  So, for that I rate our experience with Delta a notch lower and the InFlight entertainment as poor - whereas it was excellent on the return flight.  The food & beverage both ways was typical  Economy-Class international flight fare. Our return from Paris  on Friday March 13 was most notable because 30 hrs before Pres Trump had announced travel restrictions from Europe (Covid-19) that would start at midnight Friday so making our plane as scheduled was a bigger deal than normal.  The Delta cabin crew did a good job under difficult circumstances on a totally packed plane.  Due to Covid-19, Delta apparently cut way back on recirculating the air in the cabin to bring in much more outside air than normal the entire flight so the cabin was cooler than normal... the crew distributed extra blankets and we appreciated their precution under the circumstances.  Other than some rough air over the Atlantic, the flight was pretty normal, the food and service was typical of other international flights we have taken.  Again, the Delta cabin crew did an admirable job under the circumstances. When we made our reservations we took the very last row in the main cabin  which had only 2 seats including a window in the row (all others had 3) and a bit more room to recline our seats which was nice.Livng in the SE USA Delta is our preferred airline although we flew back from Paris last October on Air France and I loved it - the food & beverage and overall service were terrific on that flight!"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Delta Rises to the Top,"Once again, very impressed with Delta.  From the professionalism of their staff and pilots to the cleanliness of the aircraft.  Most importantly how they are handling the corona virus.  They were taking all precautions with their staff and their customers.  Extra cleaning took place in the flight I was on.  They also handled cancelation and flight changes with ease during this time as well! #deltarisestothetop"
Date of travel: March 2020,20,Delta sucks,At one time this was a good airline.  Somewhere along the line they got greedy.  First of all my seat was cramped and sore and worst of all they forgot to put my bag on the plaine.  I will say their customer service will bend over backwards for you as the did help me on my visa.  Next time i will fly spirit
Date of travel: November 2019,50,What  a difference from BA and AA,"25 years ago, I had a bad experience with Delta. I vowed to never fly Delta again. Over last year,  I read the chatter in the business press about Delta taking the opposite strategy to AA and BA who have a monopoly for direct flights from PHX to LHR.  My flight was half the price, it stopped in Detroit, so easy.   Ditto on return in MSP, so much easier than PHX as entry into US.  And Delta kept my miles from 25 years ago (BA does not), and I now receive emails from Delta CEO (not BA after 20 years of flying BA).  Just one request, please serve evening cocktails before the dinner service. You can still monitor consumption, and this would be so much more civilized.   FYI, BA dinner is 90% carbs to fill you up. Delta is 50% and delicious even in coach.  I will be back."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,BS,If you want to wait longer than the actual flight delta is the way to go.                    Hjbhnbhjbvvvhhbvgjbbvvbbvvvbbb
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Flight delay,After an all day sitting at the airport our flight was not only delayed by an hour but also a gate change which was a hassle because of the crowds in the airport departing cruise ships.  Our cruise was okay but we were tired and by this time were just ready to go home.  Once we finally boarded and took off flight was okay.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Flight okay,Due to delay of our flight to get to Atlanta we nearly miss this connection.  Flight left on time and arrival also on time - no problems.
Date of travel: March 2020,40,MSY-ATL,"I was scheduled on flight 1293 leaving at 4:50pm, yet I got to the airport early and asked the gate attendant for flight 2936 (leaving at 3:48pm) if I could get on that flight given that it was 1/3 full. He said I would have to pay $75. I explained I was on a business trip and could not pay it, yet what difference would it make since the flight was quite empty. He was arrogant and rude and blew me off, without even making eye contact. While my husband enjoys platinum status with them, I do not, as I fly AA more often and have my elite status with them. In the midst of the corona-virus outbreak, and after reading that airlines were being more accommodating, I asked him why he couldn't help me, to which he replied that the accommodations only applied to passengers flying to and from affected areas. In my opinion and given the circumstances, all are affected areas. He proceeded to close the flight and not even look back. In these times, especially, one would think there would be more empathy, yet, sadly that is not the case.Needless to say, I will not blame the entire airline, which has always provided great service, for the faults of one arrogant and unkind person."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Flights delayed,We were an hour late leaving Grand Rapids due to deicing a number of flights before as well as ours. We came close to missing our connecting flight as  they were boarding the last people as we got to the gate.
Date of travel: March 2020,30,"Nice aircraft, decent service, terrible lavatories","Flew both legs of our recent trip to PHX on Delta, in a newish A321.  Check-in, boarding, good flight attendants.  Used the aft lavatories on both flights.   Absolutely unbelievable small lavatories.  My shoulders would not fit into the lav, and I am not Andre the Giant.   Flight attendant told me Delta specified these tiny lavs when buying the planes.   Jerks."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,What a change,"Everything they have done to make flying Delta like flying one of the perennial best-liked airlines has worked marvelously ! The departing cocktail, the paper menu, the hot towels, the amenities bag, the entrees and desserts, the free drinks, and the Toblerone candy as a goodbye flourish has made me change my mind about using Delta transatlantically. In 2013, flying from Madrid to Atlanta, I swore I'd never fly Delta again ! I take that back !"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Delta-MCO to MSP & MSP to MCO,"We usually fly Delta Comfort + & we feel it's worth a little additional cost to have a bit more comfort, mainly leg room.Delta's onboard entertainment was good.  Watched a very good movie, but I've got noise-cancelling headphones that really help with great sound."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Due to the pending cancellation of event,"Delta website had a checkbox  to purchase trip insurance (just a box).  Purchased it, it was added to the ticket price.  Event canceled.  Trip canceled.  Claim was rejected (not medical or death)."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,First class bad service,"Not much on service, upon boarding drink order ignored. During flight lavatory not freshened up floor wet no paper towels. Breakfast arrival meal terrible, spicy, dry.Armrest and tray table button hard to work, stiff, observed others having problems with these also."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Outstanding,"Always fly Delta.  Consistently helpful, informative, responsive, pleasant, organized.  I find my being patient, friendly can also inspire the agent to respond so and then problems can get resolved.  Customer Service Center at terminals are very helpful and they have the time to problem solve.  Delta is my ""go to"" air lines."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Excellent customer service,"This was the first time we have booked economy for the first time.  This made me nervous as there were 6 of us. However, the agents were were great and all our seats were together.  On our flight back I had some medical issues with my Asthma and the agent gave all of us priority boarding.  Thank you. However, I do not think I will fly economy again!!. There is not enough room to move, my legs and feet swelled terrible and the agent got me a wheelchair to get to the baggage claim.. Thank you.  The days of enjoying flying is long gone."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Delta Does Well,"I continue to find that Delta is one of our better airlines today.  They do a good job managing their flight schedules and boarding.  Way too many people bring the carry on baggage, which is your right, only to have to check it because the bins are full.  No reason to fuss about this.  Flight crews are pleasant.  They do a good job keeping the cabin clean after beverage service.  Flight times are spot on, or faster than expected in a few cases.  Captains communicate well throughout the flight.  In-flight entertainment is very good.  I wish they wouldn't charge for the plugin headsets, but they do. Overall they do a good job on this leg, and we've done it a zillion times."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Flight from Detroit to Paris,"I have flown Delta many times, including internationally.  This particular flight our seats were in the last row before a bank of restrooms.   I discourage anyone to choose these seats if you need overhead storage....there isn't any for these seats.  The overhead bin for these seats is used for emergency equipment only.  You have to scrounge around yourself and find a place for your things.  Otherwise, this is not the worst location on a flight.  I was surprised that it wasn't any noisier being near the restrooms, the seats still recline the same as all the others, and the leg room and underseat storage space is the same.    I tried to put my jacket (a very squishable one, I might add) in the little space there was in the bin over my seat, and the flight attendant nearly took my head off, nastily telling me to get my belongings out of there and find somewhere else for it."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,From TYS to KOA - fantastic!,"Delta had the best price and flight times, plus I was given free drink tickets at the check-in counter! What a great start to a 15 hour, 2 connection flight! All bags arrived like they should and there were no inconveniences, like boarding delays. I found there to be a fantastic selection of movies and appreciated the free snacks. The only thing that could make the flight better would be more sandwich selections so you don't have to get the same turkey sandwich each time. All in all, I had another excellent flight and will always recommend Delta!"
Date of travel: March 2020,30,Service sucks,"Delta has tried to improve their in-flight service, kudus to them. Nice upgraded food, but a serious lack of attitude refining. Their newest thing is to ignore you when you attempt to flag them down. I was stuck between the window and two passengers & couldn't get anyone for bring me some water. Even when I finally got someone's attention, he never returned with the water.Their attitude is a constant ""doing you a favor"" kind of a thing !"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Hats off to Delta,"Sadly, I had to cancel my flight due to the coronavirus. Airlines are facing challenging times, Delta responded to my request for a full refund with understanding - something not true for all airlines. Delta refunded the full price I paid for my flights. A relief. When all of this is over and I begin to travel again - I will fly Delta."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Shining in the time of crisis,I actually was unable to take this flight due to the Corona Virus - however I just want to say that Delta made the process of cancelling and rebooking/redepositing skymiles so seamless.  I greatly appreciate them making it so easy and taking any additional stress off of my mind.   Putting their best face forward when it was needed the most.
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Thee Worst Customer Service,"My husband called the customer service line for Delta on 3/15 to cancel his flight due to the ban placed on Europe & the UK due to the coronavirus. After waiting an hour understandably because of the high call volume. He unfortunately got the rep Imani. She was rude condescending and lacked empathy due to his situation. She placed him on multiple lengthy holds without checking on him, she spoke over me, interrupted him and at one point refused him a supervisor. This type of customer service is unacceptable. Imani in MA clearly needs additional client care training. I’m not sure she should even be assisting customers with her attitude and lack of empathy and sense of urgency during a time like this. This was the worst call out of all the airlines we’ve had to contact recently. I am taken aback and will do my best to not book with delta on any future trips due to this experience. Do better Delta!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Awesome flight,"I was wowed! I very rarely fly upper class as I am a budget traveler. The meal was fantastic, in flight entertainment had great choices. The attendants were so nice and thanked me for flying with them instead of me thanking them. When I can afford it I will fly them."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Flight to San Diego,I love Delta Airlines.  They are friendly and always the least expensive.  They treated me well.  I had to change flights on the way back due to maintenance and it was a breeze.  They will always be my first choice to fly.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Pleasantly Surprised-Aloha Service!,"Usually I fly first class for long flights like this last minute trip to Hilo Hawaii for business, but those seats were sold out so I opted for the next best available Delta Comfort,  Of course it didn’t have all the bells and whistles of first class but the flight attendants were very personable and I enjoyed this class of service to my surprise!  I always bring travel Clorox wipes for tray tables, arm/head rests and the seatbelt’.  Because of the Corona virus, Delta has stepped up their cleanliness procedures—much appreciated!  Although I prefer first class I was pleasantly surprised to know that Delta’s level of service does not change with your seat!  Aloha service on Delta!"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Great flight,"Great flight. The flight attendant was friendly and the pilot gave us a nice, smooth flight with well-timed updates."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,The Florida Keys and back.,Everything was on time.  No problems at any time.  Got to Key West on a beautiful day.  We left out of Miami.  Delta did it's job.
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Very poor service on our return trip from Jackson to Atlanta.,"We usually have good experiences with this airline but on this flight, the flight attendents were more rude and I was jostled more than I have ever been. I am larger than averate (6'2"" and 210lbs) and prefer an aisle seat. I often get bumped once or twice, but this flight I think the number was in the double digits without once being acknowledged."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Good sleep on an almost empty flight,"Boarding started early and was done well on time. Only 10 of 48 seats in Premium Economy were occupied, which was most likely due to the corona virus outbreak. So we had free choice of seats. I initially was seated on 34A (window seat), but later changed put my stuff on 34A and slept on 34B (the aisle seat).The dinner was tast and good airline fine food. It was among the best food I've had in a planes economy class - and it was plenty. After dinner I slept so well that I missed breakfast, so I cannot comment on that part of the journey.The crew was friendly and attentive and most importently they let me sleep until the captian declaired that we'd be landing in 25 minutes.Deltas A350 premium economy was great and I'd defiently use it again. I've traveled in PE in a Lufthansa A380 a few months ago. Both PE seats are great and I slept well in both.. The biggest difference betwene LH and Delta PE seats is that the LH has a footrest under the seat in front of you, while delta has a 'swing up' leg-rest. Ipe rsonally prefered the delta seat, but I think that is a matter of personal preference. Delta's seats in PE have a very new and good screen - at least in their A350."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Great Customer Service,"I fly Delta often.  They are my favorite airline.  The arrival and departure times are so dependable.   I have had to change my return time and they were so gracious in assisting me.  If I have a choice, I will always choose Delta."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,"Perfect, as usual.","If at all possible, we fly only Delta. Flight was on time, luggage made it, attendants were great. My only wish is that the snacks didn't include bananas. The smell makes me ill and so I breathe into my jacket for the length of time it takes a person (usually one very near me) to eat it. Gag. Also, get some snacks that aren't so ""healthy!"""
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Good Four Hour Flight,"Any four flight can be taxing, but this flight was not bad. Economy Comfort service on Delta is pretty good with free drinks and upgraded snacks as well as food for purchase. This particular flight had flight attendants who paid attention and the movie selection was good. Saw two movies traveling each way that I had been wanting to see. All in all...no problems."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,The things Delta leadership did not learn in grade school.,"Delta has been my primary air carrier for over thirty years now, but domestically and internationally.  For the most part, Delta has done a stellar job of getting me where I needed to be, when I needed to be there, for a fair fare.But, with the recent handling of a damaged bag claim, I saw the inflexible, uncaring, corporate side of Delta that makes all air travelers cringe at the mention of air travel.Simple story.  Baggage handles tore one of my bags.  It was a high quality, nice, functional bag.  I followed the airline protocol, reported the damage at the arrival airport, filled out all the ridiculously long forms and information....and, waited.Finally, I received an email linking me to a company Delta uses for damaged luggage replacement.  I found a bag that looked similar to my damaged bag, clicked on it and a few days later the new bag arrived at my home.  Except, the replacement bag was inferior to my damaged bag in every way.  I contacted Delta and returned the inferior replacement bag.THEN THE DELTA ""TWO-STEP"" BEGAN!Since they were unable/unwilling to actually replace my damaged bag I was offered 35% of my bag's original retail value.I rejected the offer since I have no access to a luggage flea market where quality used luggage can be purchased for 35% of it's actual value/cost.The emails continued for a week.  NO REASONABLE RESOLUTION!When I was in grammar school, I was taught that if you damaged or destroyed another person's property, you were punished for your wrong and were required to replace/restore the damaged property.A business like Delta which cannot/will not operate with the most rudimentary essentials of common courtesy and respect to those we ""harm"", is a business which is fundamentally flawed in their philosophy of customer relations.Now I know that the true cost of flying Delta is the published fare, plus 65% of the value of your potentially damaged/lost luggage.I'll continue to fly Delta.  I still have to get where have to go.  Sad...that a company wins my business...only by default."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Ladies sitting behind us were loud and obnoxious,The ladies who sat behind us were loud and obnoxious. Surely the  flight attendant s could tell as others ahead of us turned to look at them. The attendants should be able to ask them to quiet down. The planes were small but we expected that/.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Signature Cocktail,"Delta was on time & comfortable. The hostess was all about going to Cancun. I ask for the signature cocktail of the month? That was an issue. I had to show her the 1 cocktail of the month in the ""in-flight"" magazine( grapefruit/tequila). In Cancun, the Delta terminal does not post arrivals & departures."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,On-time flights!,I love flying Delta!  The technology was very cool!  I caught up on some movies I wanted to see.  JoJo Rabbit and later Motherless Sons.  Both were really great.  My favorite thing...and seeing the flight path was very cool!  We did have super long layovers.  Thanks!  lots of snacks and beverages too.  The earbuds were way cheaper than in the airport stores.  $2 compared to $12.99 in our local airport.  Decent quality too.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great!!!,"Great, traveling with a family and 8 and it all went perfectly. Flight attendees were accommodating and the delta studio was great."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Cincinnati to LaGuardia Airport,Check in was fine as far as the airlines goes but security was something  else. Huge lines (Sunday morning) probably an hour or more wait. My wife has a broken leg and was in a boot. They made her take the whole boot apart and scan it twice. They also dusted her hands for gunpowder.It was ridiculous. Well we finally got on the plane and got to NYC fine. Since she had a broken leg the airlines brought us a golf cart and took us as far as the boarding gate and got us on the plane first.  Very very good service as we did not request it
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Dc Reagan to Cincinnati,Easy check in and security check. Flight took off on time and arrived on time We also enjoyed 2 free beverages
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Great service as always,"Once again I was not disappointed with my flight.  I fly frequently and Delta does not have great routes everywhere.  The few times I have to fly a different airline, I am reminded why I try to fly Delta.  Their app is awesome with the entertainment feature."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Short flights for tall people,"We had a ""free"" flight to FLorida. We cashed in our miles through American Express, and so out of pocket was about $25. My 6'4"" hubby always struggles with seat space. On the way back, the flight was not full, so the gate staff was asking if any wanted to upgrade. I went only to be told that because we were ""award seats"" we were not eligible. The man in front of hubby reclined his seat, and the upgraded seats remained empty.  Reward seats or not, Delta would go a long way in customer satisfaction to have at least allowed us the option to pay extra for the extended leg room."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Big 10,The tournament was cancelled after we arrived in Indianapolis.  Delta was very helpful in allowing us to change our tickets and fly home. They waved the change penalties. Thanks
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Comfortable Overnight Flight,"I’ve taken a lot of Delta flights in the last few years, and have come to expect a certain level of quality on each. My upgraded flight from Salt Lake City, UT to NYC did not disappoint. Timely boarding and departure, friendly and courteous staff, comfortable First Class seating and service, and timely arrival. I only wish there were more food options available to those of us who weren’t able to sleep. Thank you for being dependable, Delta!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Old Reliable,"I’ve taken a lot of Delta flights in the last few years, and have come to expect a certain level of quality on each. This flight from NY to Phoenix did not disappoint. Timely boarding and departure, friendly and courteous staff, comfortable Comfort+ seating, and timely arrival. Thank you for being dependable, Delta!"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,The app really helps,"With the Delta app, they really make things easy. You can check-in with the app so you don't need a paper boarding pass, you just go right up to the security check point and scan the code from your smart phone. You can even change seats with the app and view how many miles you have earned. Really does make traveling a bit easier."
Date of travel: May 2019,50,"Our international flight to Dublin, Ireland","We flew Delta airlines from Minneapolis, MN to Boston, MT. Then from Boston to Dublin, Ireland. I found the service to be really great, considering tgst we are in economy class. I would recommend Delta to anyone. We have had great experience with them anyone we were flying from Canada to the U.S. or vice versa. And now we Delta to Europe."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Delta employees still unfamiliar with corona,"Just tried to sit with my three young kids in some JFK airplane rows that were totally empty, rather than heading further back toward our assigned seats, which had scattered people throughout. Figured we might be a bit safer. But Delta disagreed and informed us that unless we wanted to pay for premium seating, we’d have to head back with the masses. Three levels of employees stuck to this message. Nice to know we can all focus on what’s important during this difficult time. In any case, DO NOT pay to select a seat in advance, especially if flying to or from New York. You will have no trouble getting seats together when you arrive at the airport."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Delta delivers.,"In the last few weeks I have had a couple of trips get canceled due to Covid. If it was my choice, I would have flown? But safety is a concern. My last good flight was to Orlando from MSP. Delta and it's agents delivered well. Thanks!"
Date of travel: March 2020,30,Good service.... but,Delta is a good airline but the service sometimes are not so much the way they talk to people it’s not so nice at time and the snack it’s a no no they choice of snack it’s poorly and again the drink full of ice like give us a can of soda and a real snack
Date of travel: March 2020,20,A Friday the 13th Horror on Delta Airlines Flight DL 3097,"I, along with two other passengers (three black women) in my row, traveling from a symposium, had a horrific experience of unequal treatment by a flight attendant on Delta Airlines flight (DL 3097) from Atlanta, Georgia, to Daytona Beach, Florida, on Friday, March 13, 2020.  Onboard the flight DL 3097, the flight attendant (white woman) treated us differently than the other passengers on the plane, as compared to the excellent customer service to the row of passengers (two white females and a child) behind us. While passing out the snacks and beverages on Delta Airlines flight DL 3097, the flight attendant, either deliberately or inadvertently, neglected to serve me water without ice. As she approached the next row, a very observant student of mine politely said to the attendant, ""Excuse me, you forgot to give her the water."" The flight attendant responded rudely and continued to serve the passengers in the row behind us. After serving the next row and thanking the passengers for having ""good"" manners, she handed me the water without ice but not without an attempt to chastise me about whether or not I asked for water.The DL 3097 flight attendant finished her rounds, and as she headed back up the aisle, I stopped her and asked for her name. She gave me her first name. I asked for her last name as well. She leaned in toward our row, and her attempt to apologize went in the wrong direction. In an elevated tone, she raised her voice and said, ""You can write a report because I plan to write one of my own."" This statement was noticeable among others on the flight, odd and unwarranted. I only asked for her first and last name, nothing more. As the attendant displayed an abrasive attitude, I decided to have a teachable moment with the passengers in my row about the unfair treatment, which mirrored the persistence of prejudice in today's society. I asked each traveler in my row for their perspective on the action to take regarding the unacceptable treatment we received from the Delta Airlines DL 3097 flight attendant. Specifically, I wondered would they write the incident up or turn the other cheek (a biblical phrase). One traveler, who was on her first roundtrip flight and first time out of the state of Florida, didn't have an immediate response but later said she would write it up because she writes everything. The other traveler said she would turn the other cheek and be merciful. Amid this teachable moment, which I felt was appropriate and necessary, a passenger in the row in front of us was trying to get my attention. When the passenger (white woman) finally got my attention, I asked her if she would like to say something. She immediately responded, ""Have you ever heard of beating a dead horse? We all hear you, you know."" I, for one, would never beat a dead horse. It's inhumane! But, since I'm from the south, I have heard of this saying and fully understand it's meaning. She uttered other comments, but I stopped listening to her. This opportunity was yet another teachable moment. It showed in real-time the outcome of allowing one person to treat you with less than dignity and respect. Others will feel they can do the same. The behavior is like a contagion and spreads quickly. After we wrapped up the discussion on the matter, we sat quietly and eagerly waited for the flight to land.After the horrible flight incident, death stares from a party of white passengers, and a wait time of 1 hour 01 minutes and 15 seconds to speak with a Delta Airlines representative, I remembered a fundamental life lesson. Though the Delta Airlines flight DL 3097 incident was traumatic, I feel that forgiveness is essential and will bring peace. I strongly encourage Delta Airlines to richly invest in professional training to help employees, like the DL 3097 flight attendant, better reflect the company's core values of Respect and Servant Leadership."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Fly Delta!,The staff on this flight were very friendly and accommodating.  The seats were actually comfortable..
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Reliable airline,"In my experience, Delta has a better on time percentage than the other two locally available airlines.  This last trip was great- both legs arrived early.  Flights are generally full but staff handle it and we get to our destination.  Thanks delta!!"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Comfort+,Great legroom and service. The plane was relatively new and very clean. LGA nonstop made Delta our choice for NYC.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Delta Air Lines is a first class airline company.,This was my ninth flight with Delta  Air Lines. The plane was clean and comfortable. The people around me we friendly and accommodating. The flight attendants were pleasant and welcoming. The in-flight entertainment was diverse and enjoyable.

Date of travel: January 2020,30,Direct flight,"I appreciate Delta and the direct flight option. The crappy thing is once you book basic economy you are stuck. There where a couple of rows of open seats in “business economy” which is another 5 inches of leg room but myself a 6 ft3 250 lb guy a little leg room is appreciated. I asked the counter clerk if I am able to pay for the upgrade and was told no. Yeah I read the that once you buy blah blah blah, but if your flight isn’t full and there is a couple willing to upgrade, business is making money. Anyway, direct flights are the best. But don’t buy basic economy if you need leg room."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Best Flight Ever,"My bestie and I took a trip to Barcelona and sat in the cheapest seats possible. We were treated like queens. Hot towels to wipe our hands, free eye masks, ear plugs, and headsets were all part of the package. Our meal was amazing and included a free alcoholic welcome drink, appetizer, entree, dessert, coffee and then a hot cinnamon roll and coffee when we were an hour out of Barcelona. We received the same treatment on the way back as well. The flight attendants were incredibly friendly and very responsive to the passenger's needs. I would fly Delta again in a heartbeat!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"On time, good flight.","Good flight, on time, no issues.  I had enough legroom to be reasonably comfortable.Free non-alcoholic beverages and small snacks provided. Very friendly flight crew."
Date of travel: October 2019,10,Disasterous,Unfortunately we did not have a good experience. We were to board our plane bound for a cruise out of New York.  The plane was to go to Atlanta then on to Newark. Told this plane could not fly due to radome damage but second plane was on field and would be ready soon.  We were seated when told brake problem would prevent us flying. Put on third plane bound directly to New York so we would not miss cruise. Took off and at 3000 feet blew engine. Missed cruise lost our money on cruise.  Delta did refund us our plane fare.
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Avoid like the plague!,"LAX is a dump. It stinks, it’s falling apart, and the workers are incompetent and completely worthless."
Date of travel: March 2020,30,Don’t penalize folks who purchased tickets early,"Delta, take a page from cruise companiesaccommodating behavior during this crisis 😜. Even though we are supposed to travel at the end of May, our trip is off.I realize that things are crazy but let’s take care of good customers, too, without charging big penalties."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,DON’T VOLUNTEER TO CHECK YOUR BAG,I volunteered to “help” by them checking bag. Laptop was broken (screen crushed) when I picked it up.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,It was a direct flight to Cancun which i prefer.,"direct flight, nice flight, selection ofmovies were good, could have a wider range of music. A nice feature that Delta offer is to be able to track the flight path and the distance and time of arrival of flight."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Flight from Atlanta to Honolulu.,"I had never flown on Delta Airlines before and I was pleasantly surprised by the flight. We flew Main Cabin but recieved First Class service from the Cabin Crew. The Cabin Crew were very professional and caring, a top-notch crew. Delta allowed me to pre-board on flights because I have a physical Disability. The entertainment was very good, with many options such as tv or movies to choose from. The Delta cookie Snacks are delicious. I will fly Delta again."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,"Average experience, nothing outstanding",We purchased a package through Expedia and had basic economy tickets.  We had to pay $20 per seat to get our seats together with my husband.  Food choices for purchase could be better.
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Good experience overall but would appreciate better food choices,"I always seem to have a good experience with Delta.  However I find their in-flight food service to be lacking.  They advertise sandwiches and other light meals but I find they never have anything left by the time they get to the middle of the plane.  Almonds and granola bars are not considered a meal, it's a snack at best.  Other than that, enjoyed my flight and service was good."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Early is Good!,Flight was uneventful and arrived early.  Pilot was informative.  Crew was pleasant.  What more could you ask for?...
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Going home,"With concerns recently we were pleased with flight, cleanliness . We were delayed 3 times due to weather FOG in Las Vegas can you believe it! They provided MORE SNACKS!! High Carb would have liked cheese or PROTEIN"

Date of travel: March 2020,50,Minnesota Nice,Flight was on time.  I love being able to watch a movie during the flight.  The person ahead of me did not recline so I had plenty of room.  My only complaint was that they changed the bag pickup spot after we had walked all the way across the airport to the carousel that was supposed to be the drop off spot.
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Servicing your short term stock valuation over your customer service,"Spent the day on 3/12 trying to cancel a flight. Given the current climate, the hold time was 6 hours long. I was notified at 1pm that the event I was going to in Las Vegas was cancelled. Was able to easily cancel the hotel with no issue online. Sat on the phone for several hours to no avail. Tried utilizing the website but that did not work. Called this morning 3/13 sat on the phone for 2 hours. Finally got through to someone. I was told no refunds only flight credits... flight credits for 5 people who will not ever clearly be traveling again. I get you are trying to stave off the tail spin of your stock plummeting, but do right by your customers. I frequently fly and was thinking of applying for your credit card. I already hold the American Airlines Elite card. But not after this experience.  I also have time and resources to fight to get my money back and ""fend for the little guy"". I assure you, you went to war with the wrong person :-)  Delta G5VN2R"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,"Organized, kind, helpful, and the food was OK.",Download and use the app. Bring your own headphones. Wipe down your area with sanitizing wipes and share with those around you.
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Good service,"Service was good, the food ( snacks ) were okay. The seats could have done with a bit of TLC. But all in all it was good"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Best Airline,"I have been flying for two years now as part of my work duties located in South Carolina and Maryland.  I initially did some flipping back and forth between American, Southwest and Delta.  Fell in love with Delta - the flight crews are consistently friendly, the planes are clean and functional and other than weather delays my flights have been on time or better!  The seats could be more comfortable and the snacks/beverages are hit and miss.  I am a big coffee drinker and about 1/4tg of the time they don't have coffee available, snacks are a mixed bag.  In this day and age they should be able to provide more variety."
Date of travel: March 2020,30,Delta took my money for a nonstop flight and then notified me that I had to take a flight with one stop,When I booked my reservation I knew I was paying too much for my nonstop flight but didn’t question it because that’s what I wanted. I have the Delta American Express card I knew that my luggage would be included. Two weeks later the problem started. Delta canceled the nonstop flight and booked me with a one-stop flight on the way home. When I checked in at Aeromexico in Puerto Vallarta I was forced to pay $61 for two pieces of luggage one for me and one for my husband.  Aeromexico does not honor the Delta card. Delta should really reimburse me my $61.30.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Chicken and salad for breakfast,"The flights were fine.  We chose Delta with 3 legs rather than another airline as it was cheaper.  The flights were good, on time mostly (had to wait 2 hours for de-icing in Minneapolis).  The wrong food was loaded in Santiago so we were served sandwiches or chicken and salad for breakfast.  Many people did not eat it. Plus they woke us up at an ungodly hour!.The airport in Santiago is a nightmare. We arrived 3 hours early and stood in line for an hour until the Delta counter opened.  One woman took 20 minutes to get her problem (whatever it was) resolved.  I almost clapped when she moved on. First class had their own line but were allowed to jump in front of everyone else.One the last leg we were upgraded to first class. YEAH! The only perk was a free drink, but no lunch. The stew was in training with too little supervision."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Very Comfortable Flight,"The flight took off as scheduled with no wait. We landed at Fort Myers ahead of schedule which was awesome. The service was quick and friendly. Overall, a very nice flight."
Date of travel: March 2020,20,Delta entretainmente needs maintenance,"The crew's attention was good, but for a 3-hour flight, and after having flown for just one hour from Raleigh to Atlanta in a more cared airplane, it looks like they sent their oldest plane with screens that need a bump more than a touch and sound systems that did not work. Thank god the middle seat was empty and I was able to change."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,No problems with this trip,"Next time I will pick my seats as was stuck in the back on one of the flights from NY to Norfolk, VA"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,From Atlanta to Stuttgart in Comfort Plus,"A very comfortable flight from Atlanta to Stuttgart in Comfort Plus.  Nice leg room and the service was very nice.  I have flown this route many times since 1999 and the equipment Delta is now flying is a great improvement.  There were two negatives: 1 paying for Comfort Plus and still getting only one checked bag for free; the in-cabin food service has changed.  the first drinks service is no longer cocktails and drinks, but a ""peach Bellini"" cocktail which is way too sweet.  And the meal was missing the cheese and crackers, now only available in the rear of the plane.  Next flight will revert to the Main Cabin rate."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"Accommodating,pleasant,efficient.Professional...","Easy,approachable,pleasant....professional staff from the beginning to the end. Love the technology.etc"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Good flight,We selected Delta comfort for the VPS to MIA flight and first class for the return.. Both flights were on time; the cabin was clean and the crew professional. Comfort class is almost as nice as first and for the price quite a bargain. I chose the comfort class as first class was sold out.will definitely take it for future flights. Delta is an excellent airline.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Homeward bound,Everything was great and perfect except for the gate departure was changed and never showed on the airport monitor. This is the fault of the Delta departure gate personnel. We nearly missed our flight when our names were announced over the public announcement system. When the gate changes they need to look and makeSure it really was correctly changed (delta gate personnel)
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Flight to Bermuda,I hadn’t flown Delta in a long time. A run of bad luck and sub par customer service had soured my interest in traveling with them. This trip renewed my confidence Delta and I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of the flights to ATL and then on to BDA.

Date of travel: March 2020,50,Flight attendants were excellent and very professional.,"I know it was a short flight, but a sandwich would have been nice, since I was flying first class, but the service was excellent and it was a smooth light."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Much Improved All Round,"When I first flew Delta(not long after Delta had declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy) my experience was so terrible that I vowed not to fly Delta again soon. Thanks to the Sky Team alliance with KLM, I have been compelled to use Delta over the years. I must say that I’ve been pleasantly surprised by the remarkable transformation/turnaround. My recent flight on Premium Select was delightful. The service was awesome with a very attentive and pleasant cabin staff. It was an altogether pleasant and enjoyable experience. Keep it up!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Comfortable,"Service and flight were excellent.  Security to and from Israel was thorough, as it should be.  Announcements were clear and seats were relatively comfortable."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Very good service,Excellent service.  The flight attendants were very friendly and accommodating.  Probably one of the best crew I've flown with on Delta.  They couldn't do enough for you.  They gave out pillows and blankets and did everything they could to make it an enjoyable flight.  The flight itself was smooth and landed safely on time.  Delta is always consistently a good airline to fly.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Consistently Great,"I have flown Delta for years, back in the day from Cincinnati out to all over the world, and now with my new role usually flying out of Augusta or Atlanta and I can count on one hand how many times Delta has let me down, some bigger ways than others.  But overall the airline is top notch and will go out of its way to accommodate you and your needs.  Always keep in mind there are perils of traveling (weather, missed connections, etc) and if you realize it's not always the airlines fault you can rest assured they are trying to get you to where you want to go."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,The nicest crew,"Of course, having turned nearly all of my miles got me in first and of course, it was marvelous.  Nicest crew I've ever flown with, smoothest ride, it was perfect."

Date of travel: February 2020,50,A Good Experience & Attentive Flight Crew,The flight boarding process was organized and got everyone on board for an on time departure.

Date of travel: February 2020,50,DELTA AIRLINES - MY RECENT TRAVEL,"What can I say?  This was my first time flying with Delta recently on 5th February and returned on 26th February.  EXCELLENT EXCELLENT EXCELLENT - I cannot describe the wonderful service myself and family received.  The food, the staff, even the captain - who was flying the aircraft for the last time as he was retiring.  We all cheered him and wished him well!  A BIG THANK YOU TO DELTA - even when I had arrived at both my destination I couldn't stop talking about the service and how clean the aircraft was.  We even had an upgrade of aircraft when we changed at Atlanta for Kingston Jamaica!WELL DONE DELTA - I would CERTAINLY fly with you all again.  Keep up the good work and continue to fly the flag for DELTA!"

Date of travel: March 2020,50,Great flight! Great service! On time! And clean!,"I have been on many flights with various airlines over the years & I really find Delta Airlines to be one of the best! I did a round trip from Los Angeles, CA to Detroit, MI. The service was very good & the flights were on time. The planes were clean, comfortable, & they provided new movies to watch during the flight, along with some snacks. Delta is proactive to make sure the planes are wiped free of germs after each flight. That is extremely important! I was concerned about the Corona Virus before traveling, but felt comfortable knowing that Delta took care of the cleanliness of the planes & cared about the well being of their passengers."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,An Allergy friendly airline,"I have a peanut allergy and Delta did a great job announcing that there was a peanut allergic person on board and to please not eat peanuts on this flight. Also, they held off serving almonds which are often cooked in peanut oil.No other airline will do anything to accommodate my allergy. Delta will be my airline of choice from now on."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Flying Cattle Car,Late.  Cancelled our assigned seats and put us both in middle seats.  Hot.  HUGE line in security with people of many types allowed to cut the line.
Date of travel: March 2020,30,Nice flight but inedible food,"First Class is a small step above Coach!  The food was inedible and the seats were very cramped. Not the first class as of old. Service was adequate, if not indifferent.  Overall, the flight was ok."

Date of travel: February 2020,40,A Pleasant Flight to Amsterdam,"We traveled to Stuttgart in February to visit our son, daughter-in-la and their newborn son. Our flight took us from Boston Logan to Amsterdam, with a connection to Stuttgart, all on Delta. The trip was before the virus scare so that was not a consideration. Both legs of the trip went smoothly, wit good in-flight service and no problems boarding or with baggage handling. The food was a bit deficient, but it is with most US airlines. The cabin crew was great and very helpful."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Utah flight,Our flight was a good one.  We had a minor weather delay but that was made up in the air.  So we actually arrived slightly ahead of schedule.  Service was good and congenial.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Excellent Service,"This was my first flight with Delta since I began flying in 1965 and I was completely satisfied with the service I received from the minute I booked the flight to the arrival in Melbourne.  I was supposed to have flown from Toronto to West Palm Beach with @Air Canada but the complete booking became a fiasco even though I had booked 8 months in advance, I was not notified that the airline had changed my flight and my seating was chosen for me, which wasn't acceptable.  Needless to say I decided that I would fly @Delta with the stopover in Atlanta.  I require wheelchair assistance and was absolutely thrilled with the service I received.  The chair was waiting for me upon arrival in Atlanta and as I was changing planes, I was taken by wheelchair to a different area of the airport.  The service was absolutely perfect.  I had an approx. layover of 1.5 hours and this went by quicker than I thought and I was not put out with having to change planes.  My arrival in Melbourne was just as smooth and I am assuming that my return trip back home in April to Toronto with the same stopover will be just as smooth.  The Flight Attendants were very friendly and I will not hesitate to fly with Delta again.  The service I received was excellent and I also saved extra money as @air canada was charging me more for seats because they had downgraded me to their subsidiary company @Rouge which just did not have the right seating arrangements for me.  Air Canada has lost my business and will only be used if it is my one and only choice.  Delta I realize you are an American company, but I certainly wished to flew more non-stop flights from Canada to the USA."
Date of travel: March 2020,20,Delta flight from Maui,Seat25D&25E we weren’t aware these seats do not recline. We planned on sleeping on our first leg from Maui to Seattle) but couldn’t since the seats didnt recline . Something about being int he wing/aisle seat?

Date of travel: March 2020,10,Stolen Chanel purse!,"Awful customer service! My $5700 Chanel purse was stolen out of my checked in luggage while traveling from Miami to LaGuardia airport with Delta airlines. And after providing all the necessary credit card statements and receipt of purchase of the bag as requested by the airline, they declined to reimburse us any amount for the bag. You should be ashamed of yourself Delta! Instead of taking responsibility for the crime that was committed while my personal belongings were in your possession, you think you can just brush people off. Big mistake!"

Date of travel: March 2020,50,Great airline,"We took delta to and from Detroit to Aruba layover both times in Atlanta. The seats are very comfortable better than any other airline I’ve been on. Having top movies, games, music to watch on the screen in front of you was awesome! The pilots do a great job of informing you  of up coming unsteady weather. Stewardess were fabulous too. I will never fly with another airline again except delta thanks delta for a great round trip!!! First timer.."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,"No problems, felt safe","My only complaint is that when we filled out our immigration papers to enter Cancun, no one told us to keep them to exit Cancun. There were multiple people that flew Delta that  had misplaced them. Luckily we had one, so I only had to pay $35 for a second one. If I had known I would have been more careful. I did find it after we got home in a suitcase. Other than that it was fine."

Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great Service,A little late leaving but pilot made up time.  Flight attendents were focused on customer service!  It was a last minute decision as we wanted to attend a memorial service but were unsure of Illinois weather.  Both of us had middle seats.   All in all a good experience in today's world of air travel.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Great flight with friendly service,We had a 1 pm flight so airport was not packed. This was the first leg of an international trip.  We were with a group. Check in was easy and we took advantage of Delta American Express Offer with75000 miles! This gave us priority boarding which is a nice benefit. Flight was smoothAnd transfer at JFK to another terminal to continue to Tel Aviv was uneventful.

Date of travel: February 2020,40,50 minute delay taking off for no apparent reason but landed within 10 minutes of schedule.,For basic economy this was not a bad flight.  Checked carry on bags at gate and they were within the first ones off.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Convenience to SLC,Flying direct to a major hub that happens to be your final destination is always a plus. I could have used another air lines miles but the connections would make for a very long day. Driving would have taken 2 days each way with attendant hotel and meals. The Delta flights direct to and from Salt Lake City are less than 2 hours and easy peasy.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Winter Get Away,"The flight was good.  The only complaint I have is that they changed our flights going to Tampa and back to Minneapolis by a total of 4 hours depriving us of half a days vacation. They made us check our carry on luggage coming back which defeats the purpose of ""carry on luggage""."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great Flying Experience,I had a connecting flight. So I flew from PHL to ATL to MSY. Both legs of my trip were great. They started on time and we were actually a few minutes early to Atlanta and New Orleans. The flight staff was very attentive and did everything they could to make our 2 flights as comfortable as possible. Due to 1 flight not being full the staff allowed me and my husband to relocate seats so we could be together. I appreciated that since we weren't able to sit together originally. It definitely was a great start to a amazing first vacation. The tv options were amazin as well and helped pass the time.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Excellent Flight,The flight was uneventful but well served.  We had a slight late start but time was made in the air.  The air hosts were very good at their job and courteous.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Nice Flight,"The flight and staff were awesome, however if they make the seating any smaller, people are going to have to purchase 2 tickets!  No leg room and can't put your seat back more than 1-2""  which makes for a uncomfortable seating situation for longer flights."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Helpful to accomodate,"During COVID19 outbreak, Delta made extra steps to accommodate travel needs. It is very good. I was rescheduled easily to get where I wanted to be, got an upgrade to business class with no extra charge. Great."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,On time,"Delta has had a past reputation of being late.  This flight was right on time, attendents were pleasant, and luggage was not lost.  Can't do much better than that."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,grand cayman trip,Fine service.  Clean plane although we used clorox wipes as well.  Ate breakfast before the flight. We know there is not enough food on board to sustain our appetite for four hours.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great flight,"Great flight, very smooth landing and flight. The way there they were able to move our seats around so the 4 of us could sit together. Great flight and will be happy to fly again"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"frills, no frills!","I usually take a no frills airline to Las Vegas because of cost and convenience.  Airlines like Spirit and Sun country. This last trip I scheduled on a Delta flight. The delta flight was easy and far more efficent with staff and all around service. Delta is trying to capture more market share to these cheap and quick destinations like Las Vegas. I""ll take it! The service and pricing were in line with Sun Country and Spirit and I found some things cheaper like 35.00 luggage compaired to 50.00 for the other two airlines mentioned. Overall Delta is still in the game and the service makes up for the cost."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,missed connection,My wife and i missed our  connecting flight in atlanta because we had no time to get to our connection. we had to book a new flight to the tune of 850.00!!
Date of travel: February 2020,40,WPB,"We flew on Delta for our annual  trip. The flights going were a mess no fault of Delta, it was all weather related.There is a major difference  on premium economy, depending  on the plane. I am not positive, but I believe  it was the 737, not much difference than coach. Flight attendants were pleasant & efficient. One of the better American  Airlines, would definitely  recommend."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Great short flight,This flight was part of a multi flight trip and I was expecting air Mexico.  But check in was easy enough once I had down loaded the app.  The flight left on time and arrived just ahead of its scheduled time.  There was in flight entertainment and also a refreshment service included.  Staff were always busy and had little time to make conversation.  Service was always brisk and efficient.  This was okay for the short flight time but I wouldn't want to go long haul.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,"Generally Positive, But...",Overall service and on-time performance was well above average. All dining options were available for selection - not always the case for customers in Economy class. The airline's inability to locate an item left in a specific seat location with specific identifying features dampened an otherwise positive experience. All long haul flights should require additional legroom regardless of class of service.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,1 week before Spring break for Coppellisd Feb 29 2020 flight started as scheduled at DCA without delay,Landed before scheduled timeInflight service was 5 starSnacks / coffee was served with a smile The flying crew was friendly and amazing
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Economy comfort,"Two hour flight at 6’2” economy comfort is a plus.  I have taken this trip in first class and economy, economy plus is a good compromise between comfort and price. The wider seat, extra coke and peanuts of first class not worth the price difference.  The ability to stay in your seat, stretch out your legs without breaking your knee caps makes economy comfort worth the additional cost."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Delta 1 is absolutely amazing,It was truly amazing the comfort the hostesses and the food were first class all the way. Would highly recommend Delta.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,No Problems. Left on time and even arrived early,The flight from Saginaw to Minneapolis is direct and only takes one hour and 45 minutes. The flights are smooth and easy. The staff was friendly.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great Flight with Delta,Excellent service! Michaela was our flight attendant and she provided personalized service throughout the flight.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Broken Plane,"My Flight from Tampa to Atlanta was without incident.Waiting on the connecting flight in Atlanta, the plane pulled into the gate, unloaded passangers, but we were told there was machanical issues and we were moved to another plane at another gate.  Once at the ""new"" gate, we could not board as the maintence crew were fixing the First Class tolet.  After 15 minutes, the decided to allow passengers to board, but the first class tolet was not to be used.Not really a problem for me, since it was a short flight from ATL to OMA."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Good flight!,"Online check-in was a breeze!  If you're not using Delta Airlines app on your smartphone, your missing out! The app tracks your bags and sends you an alert each time your bags are handled! In flight service by the stewardess's was awesome! They were friendly, upbeat and served up piping hot coffee!! The plane was clean, seating was comfortable, and each seatback had a TV that you could watch movies, sitcoms, sports, news, or just listen to music if you brought your own earbuds or headphones. Delta offers inexpensive headphones for sale on the flight if you so choose. Due to weather, the flight was a bit bumpy, but we left on time and arrived on time. No delays whatsoever."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Delta is the best Airline.,I took my mom to Williamsburg Va and had the best time.  There was snow and the flight was very smooth even in the inclement weather.  The best pilots and attendants are on Delta.
Date of travel: January 2020,30,Very dirty plane and rude staff,"Plane back to Det from Tampa was filthy with crumbs/wrappers stuffed in my seat & on floor, looked like boogers wiped across my window, disgusting. The older stewardess was very rude to my fiancée when she was collecting trash because he couldn't hear him and she rolled her eyes and snatched his cup out of his hand forcefully, the lady on the overhead in the plane sounded as if she were sleeping while speaking..did not enjoy the flight back this time with this crew."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,I love the Delta Service!,I will only fly Delta! Best service best seats clean and affordable. I tried other airlines but nothing compares to Delta. Awesome sky miles plan as well. You just can't deny the Quality!
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Flew to Austin Texas,Great Flight! Everything was on time! I love that they have entertainment on board to make the flight go faster.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great flight!,"A great flying experience - everything was smooth and on time. Flight attendants were great and really enjoyed the extra legroom in comfort plus (kind of the way flying used to be). After bad experiences with other airlines (changed flights and seat, long unexplained delays, unhappy crew) it was a pleasure to have everything go so smoothly this year. Will definitely use them again."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,great flight,"delta airlnes is the best air carrier there is, the flight service was and has always been great we always book on delta ,great company"
Date of travel: March 2020,30,It was ok,"Paid to upgrade to first class. I was on window seat. Was surprised when I looked down between seat and wall and a lot of dirt, food particles etc there. They should use a vacuum attachment to get that up.Service in first class was nice but not outstanding. The blanket left on everyone's seat but mine was in a nice sealed bag. Mine was a used blanket just plopped unfolded onthe seat."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Flight times,"We had great flight times . Early morning and returning late in the evening. We had to make arrangements to get driven to and from JFK. Then we get notified that Delta changed the flight times. Now we didn’t leave JFK. Until later morning and our return flight was leaving a few hours earlier.  That means we missed spending time at the resort that we paid dearly for. That also meant that the person who was supposed to drive us to and from JFK couldn’t do it because of their work schedule. So we had to make other driver arrangements. We had booked the flights several months in advance of the trip so we were upset by the flight changes. And the list time at the resort. And at having to find another driver... and pay them to drive us! I feel there should be some money paid to us because of the inconveniences and the time lost at the resort. Oh and i also made arrangements for a driver from the AP to the resort and return trip back to the AP and that also had to be changed prior to our trip also. I feel we paid a lot of money for the flight, i chose the flight times that Delta Gave and were best for us. I can’t remember if we paid extra for those times but we may have. I don’t think i will consider using Delta for few of them doing this again. And this is actually the second time this has happened to us."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,DELTA AIRLINES SMOOTH FLIGHT,"This is one of my favorite airlines, I love that they have TV entertainment for each and every flyer. The Flight was smooth and arrived in Puerto Vallarta on time. And on the way back it arrived 1/2 hour ahead of schedule. Airline  crew are all very nice and make you feel very comfortable."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Love Delta,"Delta is the best. They do good job, acknowledging my status and thank me for flying with them. I have had little to no issues and if I have they are quick to fix"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Delta Airlines,Been to NY several times but never flown with Delta. Excellent service from the staff at Edinburgh airport to the staff and service on the plane. Staff at Edinburgh assisted with an significant ESTA problem. All staff were very friendly and appeared genuinely keen to assist . Food was much better than other airlines and films etc were very up to date and plenty of choice.
Date of travel: February 2020,30,ended up sick,"the man behind me coughed all the way.  i think he should have been made to wear a mask.  it was a full flight with no option to move.  i 2 days later became sick, and had to take antibiotics to get over it!  gurrr!"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Empty plane,Flew from Hartsfield to Schipol on the afternoon run. The plane was almost empty!Excellent service as always and a little more attention as the attendants were not busy...until breakfast which was almost missed altogether. I think the ladies were out of their routine seeing there was little to do!
Date of travel: March 2020,40,on time flights and got in early,"We couldn't check in my flight 24 hours prior.  We have a charge card and had always had a free bag to check.  So we don't have the GOLD charge card and got charged $30.00 per bag.  Ok, hasn't it been long enough that this charge should be in the price of the ticket, or just get rid of it by now?  It's old already!!   Our flights were on time and smooth flying, crew was nice.  I have never been on a flight where a flight attendant didn't walk the whole plane before landing checking for seat belts and seats in upright and trays up.  The guy in front of me reclined his seat and landed that way.  And if you don't fly Spirit because they have small space for leg room and the seat in front of you reclined takes up your room....Delta has now followed that and not so sure we will fly them for this reason and the bag charge.  Come on Delta, you are better than that"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Flight,We sometimes sit in first class because of a upgrade! This first class was extremely nice because it had reclining seats and a hot meal! There where two flight attendants and the youngest was as nice as could be! Of course they ran out of options on meals and my husband finished mine not crazy about spicy buffalo chicken!  The young flight attendant went to the back to help it took awhile for the older lady to get back to us to remove the trays and from then on she was pissy with us! She had no problem gabbing with anyone else but was cold and aloof with us didn’t really see her do anything! She demanded at the end of the flight my husband put his chair up which already was and then retold him while he was pushing the button to show her! I would say it is time to retire if that is good customer service!
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Very good flight,We were greeted well and very helpful at all major points of our trip. Snacks and beverages were offered twice on our 4 hour flight.
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Delta is Consistently Customer Focused,Hassle free online check-in.  Gate agent was effective.  Boarding process was not agonizing.  Flight left on time and arrived 20 minutes early.  Plane was relatively clean.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Flight to/from Mexico City,I purchased Comfort class and it was well worth it.  Delta uses a new plane 747-200 and it is huge but very comfortable.  Good selection of movies and now they even offer a tasty sandwich too.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Visit to my granddaughter!!!,"Delta is my preferred airline. The flight was on time and the crew was friendly and did an excellent job. I am now in Savannah Georgia visiting our 2 month old granddaughter, Sophia."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,No Knee Room - Seats Too Close Together,"There were so many rows pushed together that there was no knee room at all.  If the person in front reclined, the tray table hit you in the chest.  And, I am not big !"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Best Airline,Most comfortable seats and very courteous flight attendants.  Best customer service and always treat you like they are happy you are aboard.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Delta Airlines,"My flight departed late due to the previous flight arriving late. However, we actually arrived in Boston ahead of schedule."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,OK,"Although I had purchased a round trip air fare first class, I was not allowed to use the Delta first class lounge in Atlanta (reserved for long haul carriers and delta platinum!!! ), so my first class ticket on this trip did not qualify. Shocking and unacceptable!Also , on the flight from NYC to Atlanta, first class, we were only offered chips and nuts as meal!! Unbelievable ! first class??!!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Easy and Efficient,"This was the first time I had ever flown out of Columbus. I usually depart from ATL. The check in was quick and easy in Columbus. I was a little concerned about the flight on the small commuter plane to ATL but everything was fine. The best part was not having to go through security lines in ATL! Dulles to ATL on the return trip was great too. Good service, pleasant trip."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Flight went without a hitch,Flight left right on time and captain and crew kept us informed at all times of what to expect.Arrived on time with no problems.  Staff were all pleasant. Seats seemed less crowded than other airlines
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Small kindnesses make flying easier,"We flew from San Diego to Minneapolis. Despite the fact that my Gold Elite status had lapsed since the outward leg of our trip, a Delta agent in San Diego, Hitomi (apologies if I have mangled her name) flashed a brilliant smile and waived the fees we would have had to pay that as Silver Medallion holders. That was one of many small and big kindnesses that we have gotten from Delta personnel over many years."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Delta to Europe,"The cabin crew went out of their way to make this a delightful experience. I would recommend their international flights to both London & Nice, France."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,We fly Delta most of the time.,"Delta seems to be one of the better airlines we fly with.  They seem to be on-time, the people seem to be kind and helpful.  Most of their flights have individual monitors to watch movies and such.  Their onboard Wifi is so slow.  Several times I would try to log in and it just never connects."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,All flights are nice,"Very good flight, nice food and drinks.Breakfast was enough,Timing excellent, we arrived early..."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,A pretty good flight,It was a  pretty good flight overall given the cramped seating and your offer to give me a few inches of extra space for $94 per person!!!  Are you freakin' kidding me???
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Always Delta!!!!!,"The flight was non stop from Atl to Aruba---the seats in Economy are slighly larger and more comfortable----with more space for leg room from seats in front of you than American Airlines--(had to fly on their plane recently to Dallas) very cramped. I'm 6'2 "" and this means a lot. Got to watch 2 movies in flight ( again, all Delta flights have seat back Flat Screens with gaming and Movies and regular TV )---American Airlines---NONE!!!!  No brainier====FLY DELTA!!!!!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Delta Airlines - India to USA,"DELTA Airlines is a comfortable and cosy flight.  It serves with a welcome drinkg in addition to a small breakfast, delicious lunch and dinner.  The air hostess are co-operative and helpful."
Date of travel: July 2019,10,Worst Flight of My Life,"After we were all locked in and left the gate...the pilot informed us that we would not have any movie, music, or entertainment available on the flight. I hate flying anyway, but this 6 hour flight was unbearable. An older plane with old dirty ashtrays on the seat armrests. No apologies from the crew, no coupons or offers to make up for the inconvenience. Also...VERY VERY VERY DIRTY. We were covered with some kind of insect bites on our flanks and legs and arms...wherever our bodies rested on the seats.Terrible Terrible Experience.Shame on Delta...never again."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Flying Delta,"I fly several times a year on Delta, and I've had good experiences flying on Delta.  In 2018 my significant other had a heart attack and a triple by-pass. I wanted to remain home in order to care for him during the first few weeks of his recovery. I had already bought a plane ticket to Virginia to visit my daughter. I called Delta and the representative listened to my dilemma and very generously gave me a credit for another flight, even though my ticket was Basic Economy. I will always to grateful to Delta for helping me in this situation."
Date of travel: January 2020,30,"More comfortable than coach, but not much more",I fly first class so I can get some work done.  The seats aren’t that much more comfortable than coach but they are larger.  The flight attendants can be super nice or really arrogant.  Never know what you are going to get.  I like getting my bags off first
Date of travel: March 2020,50,"Great Airline, great service!","I took a weekend trip to Ft. Myers/ Southwest Florida and the service was fabulous! Flight Attendants were friendly and helpful. Service was on time leaving and early arriving! I did not connect but if you do, PLEASE check your connection times! Word of advice... ATL is the worlds busiest airport! ALWAYS give yourself a minimum of 1 hour connection time! A couple near me missed their first flight because they only had a 40 minute connection...clear across the airport and they were delayed leaving their point of origin! They got on this one but for your own well being, lessen your stress by giving yourself an hour or more! There are plenty of cool restaurants and shopping in ATL! Cheers!!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great service,"Our flight from Atlanta to Heathrow was great.  Staff was on the ball.  Food was decent for plane fare.  Flight attendants came around often offering water, snacks and drinks.  In our Premium Economy seats we were offered a warm towel to wash the face and hands.  Later one a free  speciality alcoholic drink.  On the flight there I could never get the sound to work on my TV screen so I was told I could move to another seat but I stayed since I was seated with the hubby.  Before we disembarked the flight attendant gave me and my husband each 5000 Delta Sky Miles for the disruption.  THAT was very appreciated.  On the return flight no such issues.  Movie selection both ways was very good with many of the movies I had wanted to see available.  Same great crew and same things offered.  Very pleasant flights  which was made better by good professional flight attendants.  We fly Delta a lot and like the airline.  I like to get the Premium Economy seats for the extra legroom on flights longer than 5 hours due to my age and having RA.  Those seats and space are very roomy and comfortable.  I recommend Delta because they have always treated us well."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Superb Service,We flew from phoenix to Los Angeles using Delta for the first time. It boarded early and it left on time. The cabin crew were very helpful and even exhibited a sense of humour in dealing with one another and the travellers.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Nice flight to New Orleans,we flew down to see New Orleans and the then a cruise in the Caribbean.  Delta offers several flights a day and it is only a little over two and a half hours.  We picked an earlier flight and landed about 10:30 am.  That gave us most of the day to explore.  Flight home was a 5pm flight so we had a good part of the day before we went to the airport.  Great trip and loved New Orleans
Date of travel: February 2020,40,good flight with no hick-ups.,everything went normally.  Reasonable service. Like all airlines I would like to have a little more leg room. It wasn't cramped like a united flight.
Date of travel: July 2019,50,Delta is amazing.,I flew into Chicago and then on to Tokyo and then on to Bangkok on JapanAir. The flights were great. The flights were on time. The attendants were professional and friendly. The food on the long flight was great. It is really worth upgrading to business class if you have the miles or cash as it makes the biggest difference going on long flights.
Date of travel: March 2020,40,"If you book ahead of time, you save money...","The flight departed on time on a fairly new and clean aircraft.  I do not pay extra to choose my own seat....as long as I can get to my destination safely and on time, it seems ridiculous to pay extra to choose my own seat."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Best service I’ve had in 3 years flying,Excellent crew.. very friendly and catered to our needs.. will be flying again in May and I hope I get the same service
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Business class to Cancun,"Flight was wonderful, loved the attention.  Food was great and seats were very comfortable.  I took away points because we were not able to use the Lounge at JFK because Cancun is not considered International, Mexico City is.  How does that make sense? We were a little disappointed."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,A 16 hr nightmare,"My husband I ! Sat in 3 across with us in the middle and aisle. 2 min before the door closed, a Chinese Amer woman tells us “I need to use the bathroom frequently.” As this was the beginning of the virus, we were a little apprehensive but happy to periodically stretch our legs. 7 hrs into the flight, she started to vomit. Even thoughSeveral stewardesses came by to check on her and offer larger barf bags, no one offered to move us! Or her! I should have insisted but it was an almost full flight. When I questioned one of them she replied, “You should have moved yourself to an empty seat.”"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,The best,I recommend spending the extra money for first class. In comparison I have flown the other and by far firs class is excellent. He back of planes are noisy. Closer to the pilot the better the air flow. I have used Delta for decades. Nothing but the best if your flying.
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Short  trip home in 1st Class,New Orleans to New York and back in 3 days - Thank God for 1st class - but it was costly - POINTS - I am a large man at 6’4” and wide in the seat - no way would I have been comfortable in coach.  The plane was packed both ways - but the flight crews where spot on - left nothing to want despite the early hours.  Now if they would open their terminal waiting areas it would have helped a lot - just not enough seating and forget comfort if you have to be there any length of time.  EVen the bran new New Orlean airport - it might be international but its not people - TSA doesnt even arrive till 3:45 AM - and the rest is still just warming up when your boarding for a 6 am flight.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Our Delta roundtrip  Raleigh - Atlanta - Madrid,"We had a very smooth flight both coming and going Raleigh - Atlanta - Madrid.  The service was excellent, and the food was good.  One other important thing, the legroom was very ample."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Great job Delta,"Recently took Delta and had a great flight into Albany, NY from Atlanta. The flight attendants were especially supportive of everyone’s concern regarding persons with a cough or sniffles in light of the ongoing flu outbreak. Great job to the Why do tenants and staff."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Paris flight,"Despite being stuck in coach, the experience was Very  good because of the flight attendants.The whole experience is mapped out by your in flight guide and you are treated like a guestLong flights are no fun but Delta makes it tolerable by providing great customer service.Warm towelsA nice greeting cocktail Good foodExcellent beverage serviceFriendly back of plane folks"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Delta is my 1st choice,Always choose them because they are leaving on time and get to destination even earlier. Stuff is nice and helpful.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Perfect,On-time service clean cabin and wonderful service… In flight movies and some meal service… Cabin crew was wonderful
Date of travel: September 2019,30,Airlines suck,"I'm surprised that anyone rates most american airlines as anything but average; at least Delta is clean, but you pay for it.You also pay for just about everything else even though they gouge you on ticket price. Whatever happened to the good old days of service. They act as if they are doing you a favor even though you just shelled out nearly $1000.00 for tickets and an extra $50 for a second bag. I am sad because I remember in the 70s and 80s when Delta actually wanted your business and tried harder than other airlines. Oh well, the past is past and airlines suck nowadays"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Geat flight from Boston to Cancun,Great flight and time.  Best in-flight entertainment.  Would always take Delta when flying to Cancun.  Only wish it was a bigger airplane than a 737.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Atlanta to Honolulu,"Good flight, however, as people are getting larger the airlines are making seats smaller and decreasing the amount of legroom! From LAX to Honolulu I had an XXXL man seated next to me and he couldn't fit in the seat with armrest down. He lifted it up and took up a third of my seat. Very uncomfortable. Flight was on time and landing was smooth.Good selection of entertainment. Staff attentive."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Great aFlight,Great flight with a great staff. I have never had a bad experience flying with Delta. They will always be my first option.
Date of travel: March 2020,40,"Still Not Smiling, However They do Their Job!","I was sitting in the economy comfort part of the airplane which gives you more leg room. Overall the flight was good except for take off and landing which was very bumpy, for no particular reason. I had landed a couple of hours earlier on a flight from Amsterdam and we landed very smoothly considering it was a smaller plane, Boeing 737-800 as opposed to Boeing 777 for the Paris to LA flight. Maybe it was the captain.The entertainment choices are not updated. Maybe it's because I travel this route 6 times a year that it seems the same stuff ever time."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,ONLY WILL FLY DELTA,"1st class is the only way to go and if you book it right VERY little price difference. No baggage weight restrictions or # of baggs (within reason) You go to the front of the line. The seat is WAY more comfortable, very courteous service, accommodating and flights are on time (for the most part) if they are not they will make accommodations immediately"
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Adequate travel and xperience,Food and service ok. Blanket not clean. Leg room on Air Fance from Detroit excellent and services also.
Date of travel: February 2020,30,"Smooth operator, no feather's required","If your goal is to get from here to there at a good price with friendly staff, Delta flight fits the bill.  Direct flight is fast, comfort is reasonable,  flight attendants pleasant, drinks and snacks provided are typical, but appreciated."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Trip,"Excellent service, staff is friendly and accommodating without being overly intrusive.Highly recommended."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Outstanding customer service all the way around,"Delta continues to provide great service from the very first contact with them until the very last, on the ground and in the air."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,"All good flights, minus one redeye from Seattle to JFK","We flew with delta 4 times, they were absolutely amazing for 75% of the flights. We had one redeye from SEA to JFK where the lead flight attendant refused to turn all the lights off. For this reason, we will never do a redeye with them again. Our intentions in taking these types of flights is for everyone to sleep and recharge for the time change, that was not possible and gave us quite the 48 hours with our 2 year old."

Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great flight,"Stress free flights there and back!  No delays, friendly staff and perfect layover time of 1  1/2 hours in Atlanta. Pensacola airport was a small clean and pleasant surprise.  Chick-fil-A by gate and coffee shop a bonus"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,One of the easiest flights I've had from start to finish.,"It's been awhile since I have flown but this was one of the best experiences I have ever   had.  We had our boarding passes and the process at MSP to check luggage took about 3 minutes.  Security was only about 10 minutes, but this was a 6:30 am flight.  Boarding was smooth and quick and we were able to leave early and also had an early arrival.  Our luggage was waiting for us at the pickup and off we were to enjoy our vacation!"
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Toxic air,"As soon as we were in the air, I started to have a little cough.  It became persistent during the flight.  I was totally fine beforehand.  By the time we'd been in LAX for an hour, waiting for the next leg, I had bronchitis which turned into asthma, chest congestion and a sinus infection.  All from this flight.  I'm not happy about whatever it was in the air or on my seat that caused this."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,very good accommodations and very friendly and helpful flight staff.,"Love flying this airline, airline is clean , almost always on time and good connecting flights. The staff is very helpful in making sure you make your connections."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,First Class - Always,"Delta takes care of you, no matter where you are sitting. My experience this trip was exceptional. The attendants were awesome."
Date of travel: August 2019,30,Worse flight ever,Delta seemed very disorganized at gate Over sold flight which I found people saying is not uncommon And I upgraded to select my seat and they switch it around Not really interested in flying them again
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great airline!,Delta was a wonderful surprise compared to our other recent airline trips! Staff were all so pleasant and eager to please! Food and drink were plentiful and free😀WiFi was also free with recent movies and tv shows. Can’t say enough good things about our round trip flights! Will definitely request Delta for our next trip!
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Mrs,Enjoyed our Delta flight from Detroit to Tampa.  Flight was a few minutes later than expected.  Flight itself was pleasant and the crew was friendly and helpful.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,I just love flying Delta,"I love flying Delta.  The aircrew was wonderful and the flight was quick, with little wait time at the gate at either end."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,delta flight to Cancun,"Had a nice flight over all things went pretty smooth on the way there, on the way back tried getting all,our boarding passes at the hotel I was able to get my wife's boarding pass no problem when it came to mine it denied my pass stated I needed to check in at the airport. Got to the airport all was good got my boarding pass got through security went to my gate for boarding while we're waiting they call my name went to the front desk they stated I needed to go to security screening again before I boarded.everyone in my group was able to board with no problem to include my wife I feel I was singled out because of my Name.

Date of travel: February 2020,40,Very nice if not cramped.,"The crew was very pleasant.  We were delighted to have a bog airbus.  However, the seats are really narrow.  For a quick shuttle, it is ok but would not like it for a long trip.  Good entertainment screen."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Even with a minor equipment delay on time and a great flight,The flight crews at Delta never cease to amaze me!  They take everything in stride even when it makes hard for them to do their job (Safety of the passengers).  At push back we had the entire AV/Entertainment system lose power and they really handled it well.  In the end was nice to have a conversation with the person next to me instead of staring into our respective screens.  Great flight and a great team!
Date of travel: February 2020,50,LAX to Portland flight,"LAX terminal 2 and 3 can get crowded with limited seating.However, the flight was good, plane was clean and flight attendants were very courteous and attentive. Flight on schedule and with good in-seat entertainment choices."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Flight back Home,Delta had seats for me and my wife. The second flight they gave us assigned seat again. What I really liked they allowed military and Retirees to go first. They were courteous and very professional.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Flying Delta Air Lines,"Everything went well. I recommend using the Fly Delta app. It keeps you informed and up to date. It also provides you with your boarding pass, no need to print one."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Atlanta is Trouble,"Delta really doesn't have it all together.  The airport is tough to navigate with the trams, distances and all.  This is especially in my case since I needed a wheel chair and of course it was not available in both directions, broken leg, plus knee surgery and all, let alone a recent TIA surgery.  Disapponting on their leg.  CDG and FLL were much better."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Incorrect Departure info on boarding pass and online,"Booked Nonstop JFK to CDG on Feb 12, 2020... Boarding doc indicated this was a codeshare with AirFrance departing Terminal 4, gate B42.I called Delta the night before the flt to question the departure terminal, as Air France normally flies from Terminal 1 .. The y assured me my boarding pass was correct and Termna4 was correct.Arriving at Terminal 4 , I noted there was no Air France or delta flight on the board for CDG. I proceeded to discuss with a ticket agent and a supervisor intervened . looked at my ticket and told me to proceed to gate B42 at terminal 4 .. for my flight.. I again called Delta CS and was assured my flt was leaving from Termnail 4 Gate B 42 is a long hike ... and I asked if there was a live Delta agent i could talke to ..verify deprature... they told me to see the agent at Gate B32 who could hel... I wlaked way out there and the Delta agent looked at my ticket and told me:1> there was no such Delta flt as shown on my pass.2> My flight was a code share and flying from Termail 1  and i should know this about code shares??I fnally got help from an elderly airport info voluteer who asked a Delta FA walking by... she looked at my ticket and told me the ticket was printed wrong and to go to T1... and she showed me the way.AFter i got to T1  an hour and a half after arriving at T4, things proceeded smoothly with AirFrance Up until 20 mins before flt I was still receiving email notices from Delta that my flt was on time leaving form T4 gate b42 ( the wrong one)Finally, after on the plane and 10 mins before pullback I received a change notice from delta   to go to Terminal 1 The flight was great on Air France , but Delta employees except that FA were TOTALLY UNHELPFUL, if not somewhat arrogantWill not book Delta again unless there is no alternative"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,What a flight!,"After a great week in the caribbean, we boarded an Airbus A330. This plane was clean, and very spacious even in general class. The staff was very friendly and helpful. the flight was smooth and very pleasant. I will look for other Delta flights with Airbus A330 in the future. Well done Delta!"
Date of travel: August 2019,40,"Trip to Sydney, Australia","We go to Sydney annually to see our daughter and grandsons, and almost always fly Delta. Our experiences generally are positive, except the food and movie choices."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Boston to Orlando,Flight took off on time and landed a little early. Flight staff were helpfull.Wish the shorter Delta flights had better food options.Son has a peanut allergy and the flight staff asked the other passesgers to not east peanuts.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Minneapolis Delta Flight to Ft. Lauderdale,"Minneapolis is one of the better airports I have ever been in. They make things easy and quick as possible and that's including TSA! I have never felt unsafe. Boarding my Delta flight was easy and the attendants were kind and helpful to other passengers. I did notice the one Flight Attendant in Comfort Plus was a bit rude to myself and some of those traveling with me. She made unprofessional comments and faces towards one of the persons in my group. Completely uncalled for. The flight to Ft. Lauderdale was smooth, the pilot was informative when we were approaching turbulence and when we were approaching our landing time. I do enjoy flying with Delta although their prices to upgrade lately are seriously outrageous...but that's the way of the business, yeah?Delta has definitely been the best when i take vacations."
Date of travel: March 2020,20,Outdated and Uncomfortable,"The only good thing about this flight was that it was on time and arrived early. The flight was extremely hot, the plane was so outdated that the monitors were temperamental (the sensor in it wouldn't let me click correctly) and the monitor wasn't up to date like other Delta flights. The seats were so uncomfortable that neither myself or my partner could sleep on the flight."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,The long flight is worth it,"My wife and I flew on Delta flights 30 and 33, flying direct/non-stop to/from London-Heathrow from Atlanta.  The flight times are 8 hours ATL-LHR and 9 hours LHR-ATL. Our flight from Atlanta departed in the evening, giving us an early-morning arrival time. After getting through customs, getting our bags, getting our rental car, etc., we got on the road, on our way to our first destination, a bit tired from the all-night flight, but reasonable enough to get us there safe and sound. :-)  Our return flight to Atlanta gave us an early-afternoon departure, giving us an early-evening landing. This worked out well, because we got home with a few hours to unpack, make our needed stop at the grocery store, and then by the time bedtime arrived, we were definitely ready to hit the hay.Great flight experience both going to and from. The flight attendants took care of everyone, very well. If/when my wife and I trek over to the UK again, we'll definitely look to travel with Delta."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Great fare,I find flights on delta reasonable but lately they have been running late or changing location on you. The basic fare is great & you still can get a decent seat for the most part.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,NY to Edinburgh,"Lovely flight, good meals, service and inflight entertainment. At tentative staff. Would use again for USA"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Flying with teenagers,"It was exactly what we expected. Basic services, the crew was friendly and helpful, we were rarely seated together and that was okay.  I think we all needed a break from each other at some point."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Chicago Trip,Excellent service on first class and we were upgraded while we were waiting at the gate.Short flight but we were well taken care of.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great people and great service,We travelled back home from the ski fields with ski bags and luggage. Staff at check-in were great and checked our baggage all the way through to Sydney. The service on the flights from Denver to LA and then LA to Sydney was great. Nice to have staff genuine in their efforts to make you feel comfortable and well fed and hydrated. I am very impressed by Delta and will fly them again
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Good flight,"Was a nice flight, changed planes in Atlanta, no problems, both flights were full. Flight personal were very nice."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Good experience. Would fly with them again.,Flight attendants and pilots were very polite and efficient. All planes were on time. I love the new seats with the electronic game/flight tracking center in the back of the seat in front.I have flown numerous airlines. The only thing I hate about Delta is the closeness of seats in economy. They just seem to have a few inches less room. I jhave never understood why planes board people in the aisle seats first and then people in the middle and the window seat. Seems like it should be the other way.
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Northern Italy and Lazurne Switzerland,Great Service good food.  Flight was smooth and seats were excellent.  Flight attendants were helpful and great.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Very Professional,"The crew was so professional. In first class I realize we are catered to, but it was above and beyond!  My mobility is limited, yet it did not interfere with the trip due to the wonderful attendants.  I was even impressed with the meal we received!  Once we arrived I was met with a wheelchair and an attendant."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Extra bonus on Delta flight!,"Loved the gate and convenient easy access.  All brand new!  Beautiful view of water and scenery!  All on time and very polite and professional.  Bonus photo opportunity as the sun was setting just after take off.  Amazing reflection of sunset on plane wing was right angle, timing and priceless."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Very pleased with flight experience!,"The flight was on time, no issues coming or going. Flight attendants very accommodating and friendly."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,great service from crew,"The crew was very nice and did an excellent job with the little they had to offer. Delta, with close to 4 hours flight at 10AM and 6PM, should offer a small meal. there is plenty of time and how much could that cost? I am 6' tall and a couple of inches to spare at the knee."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Easy and smooth from beginning to end of flight,We’ve flown on Delta more than any other airline as we’ve only had good experiences.  I’ve always received great customer service in preparation of the flight. Every Delta representative I’ve spoken to were courteous and helpful. We flew comfort+. The flight was on time and the boarding was quick and efficient. We were able to quickly change planes at JFK with a 1 hour 10 minute layover. We arrived early to our final destination. We had plenty of legroom and comfortable seats. The food was not bad for airplane food. The restrooms were kept pretty clean. The flight attendants were friendly and helpful.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Delta is our favorite!,"We are loyal longtime customer of Delta (NWA prior)...great staff, good ride and caring customer service.  On our flight from Phoenix we were fortunate to be up front where Reggie provided top notch professional service."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Lovely cabin crew & really nice food,"Recently traveled with Delta , never considered flying with them before,  always traveled with Aerlingus / Virgin . My experience of this airline was great . Cabin crew were so friendly and couldn’t do enough for you . Loved the food and drink with a welcome cocktail to start off , Great choice of movies too. Would definitely recommend flying with this airline. I prefer them to the others now"
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Vacation is over!,"The flight to and from our destination was great, only one thing that needs to be changed with all airlines is the size of the seats and bathroom. I'm 5'2 and 120lbs and it was a bit cramped even for me."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,On time with excellent service,"Bev made the flight a wonderful experience both to and from Bermuda.  She was attentive and remembered our names, a very nice touch.  On the return trip she remembered that I liked lime with my tonic and had some available.  WOW!"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Painless Airline  Travel,"I flew Delta from Liberia to Atlanta, to LA, to Sydney. Service was full, on time and all of Delta performed very well. Face to face airline crew are professional, polite and enjoy their jobs. It made my journey of about 28 hours painless."
Date of travel: June 2019,50,Vacation,With Delta Airlines they were quick with the refreshments and great assistance in any thing that we needed.  While other airlines that I have traveled they charge for the movies and with Delta Airlines the movies were free.  From now on when I travel I will choose Delta.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Good non-stop flight,Flight was good. Delayed 15 to 20 minutes to allow flight crew to get mandatory rest period. Made up time in the air and arrived on time. Direct flight. 717 is a nice aircraft.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great pilot kickoff,"Prior to our boarding of the flight in Boston, our Flight Captain came out to the waiting area to address the passengers waiting to board.  He was professional, warm, covered a welcome, his request to pay attention to his boarding crew both on and off the plane so we could leave on time, then walked around the waiting area to say hello and welcome everyone on the flight.  Once on board, he was thanking all of us for our cooperation, kept us informed on the flight.  All in all, it was unique, welcome and a fun way to start our vacation to Florida"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,I Love Delta Airlines🥰✈️,"I love Delta airlines. I flew RT from Los Angeles to Japan business class. I also flew RT LAX to JFK premium coach. I’m going to Paris on Delta in May business class RT because Delta is so clean, stylish and organized with outstanding service. The Delta terminals are the best. I noticed international on coach everybody had slippers and endless snacks. I also noticed coach was spacious. I thought to myself this is the best coach I’ve seen on an airplane. The bathrooms in business are larger they have Mailn Goetz soap and hand cream. First Class is very sleek and modern. The entire plane (new interior) which is all I know because I haven’t yet been on the old interior is modern. There are plenty of TV shows and Movies to chose from.  I had Wi-Fi all the way from LAX to Tokyo and from New York to Los Angeles.  On the way to New York from Los Angeles there was no Internet it was down :( Delta has a great app and keeps you updates instantly on every detail from the moment you book all the way through. I’ve been on many different airlines Delta is by far my favorite.  I now only book through Delta."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Great flight,"Great flight..comfortable..great service from the flight attendants.On the return flight the plane was virtually empty,so we all received ear plugs free and  snacks."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Kentish Four.,"This is our sixth time of flying with Delta and as always the cabin crew were very accommodating and always there to assist. From start to finish, all we can say, is well done TEAM."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Delta flight,The seats were a little close together- as in all flights nowadays I think- but we were happy with every other part of our flight.  Courtesy- on time- pleasant staff.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great Flight,"Great flight! It was on time, plane was very clean,  comfortable  and crew was very nice and helpful from the checking process to baggage claim. Thank You!"
Date of travel: March 2020,30,Delta did not Hit the Mark on this Flight (DL1382),"There was one thing that made this one of, if not the worst Delta flight I have ever been one...the flight attendants!  This crew was the worst.  In a five and a half hour flight, this team serviced the economy customers one time.  ONCE, that is it.  Prior to the service I walked back to the galley to request some water to take a couple of asprin.  I asked, ""may I have some water?""  Sir, the service will begin in about 10 minutes.  ""I just need a little water to take some pills"".  Sir (forcefully), return to your seat, the service will start in 10 minutes!""  Now, we have already been in the air over 90 minutes.  This flight attendant blatantly refused to serve me water while the other attendant sat there.  It was pathetic and disappointing.  Surprisingly the next leg from LAX to MCI was one of the most pleasant flights.  In that 2 and a half hour flight the flight attendants were friendly, attentive and appreciative of their customers."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Cindy Lou,"I had a wonderful flight from Montgomery to Atlanta.  The service was great, although we didn't have time for drinks or snacks.  I have always liked Delta.  I ended up with a $600.00 gift card in lieu of the return flight so that someone else could travel.  That was awesome."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,No fun flying anymore,terrible. cramped flight. no carry on luggage space in overheads. no free bags.audio/visual not working. had to check in twice in mexico. snack lunch terrible.
Date of travel: April 2019,30,Flying Delta,"Was a long flight 13 hours, didn't get anything to eat other than a pack of crackers and a small drink."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,You might pay a little more but it is worth every penney.,"Vegas to Cleveland is a 4..5 hour flight. If you fly on a cheap non stop airline you might pay a few bucks less but you are in for a long flight. Flying Delta we had a brief layover which was great as we could stretch use the bathroom and get back on the plane. Delta has movies, drinks, snacks and great flight attendants. You are relaxed, in a much larger seat, more leg room and fantastic service. They have become my flight of choice and you can get hotels and car rentals at great prices through them too."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great flight,"Great flight.  Flight attendants attentive, with good service overall. Flight crew kept passengers informed.  Good selection of in-flight movies, with new release movie options."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Excellent service,"Th flight was comfortable .On board crew were excellent.,friendly and efficient.Lovely food and drinks  menu Up to date entertainment.Could not find fault."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Service has really been upgraded,"Leg room was adequate for my 5; 10"" husband.  And, not only has the food and service improved - menus choices actually taste good.  Unlike our KLM connection which was booked from Amsterdam to Nairobi, even the English language onboard movies offer a closed caption option which is important for those with hearing issues and/or lousy headphones.  This wasn't the case on KLM and the only movies with English captions were foreign, especially Dutch."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Small plane non stop to Boston,Flight was so smooth hardly noticed take off and touch down. Flying on a smaller plane with only two seats per side is really nice. Seats seemed a bit wider and therefore more comfortable.
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Not Enough Time To Reach Connecting Flights Charging To Check Bags,"I've flown this airline for years and have always loved Delta; however when flying from Indianapolis to Florida; and back, there is always a layover in Atlanta, and my recent experiences flying Comfort Air not only are they now charging a $30 bag fee for one checked bag, but their layovers are too short  maybe 15 to 20 minutes to catch your connecting flight. Atlanta is a HUGE airport, and it used to be that you'd had 90 to 120 minutes, and now I only have 15 to 20 minutes to catch the underground train and then run to the end of the next terminal to catch my connecting flight. This is problematic with knee and hip replacements. They never used to charge a fee for checking one bag. Their flight crews are great, but this is the most $$$$$ airline, and I always fly comfort or first class. First class doesn't get charge a baggage fee, but now Comfort does! I get them charging a baggage fee for economy. They have no direct flights to Florida, and total air time from Indianapolis to Florida is 2 to 2 1/2 hours. Start offering direct flights and stop charging baggage fees for Comfort Air which is right behind 1st Class! I'll be flying Southwest from now on. They don't charge for baggage and have direct flights. Nice way to treat long time customers."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Great flight and would use again,Plane was on time and clean. Staff was very friendly and accomidating. Security was and screenly was simple and quick.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Delta round trip from DTW to FLL,The flights were on time. Boarding was relatively quick and easy. Leg room and seat comfort are not great but better than most flights. The movie selection was really good. Snacks are average but with a wide selection of beverages.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Good service but no explanation for cancellation,Our flight was to leave at 5 pm from Vegas and we had a connecting flight to Winnipeg in Minneapolis. In the morning we got a notice that the flight was delayed 1 hr. Up until 2 pm we were still flying. But at 3pm on our way to Airport got that the flight was now cancelled and we would have to re book. We did not leave until midnight on a huge aircraft with 22 passengers aboard . There was no weather concerns so had no reason given for the delay. However the employees at the terminal and in the air were awesome!
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Very smooth flight Meals good Cabin crew very attentive,Plane took off on time The service on board very efficient A rather nasty fight occurred during the flight and the crew responded very professionally These participants were removed by the PoliceWe then flew from Las Vegas to New York and then onto Miami In each case the flights were enjoyable.The flight from Miami to Uk gained nearly 40 mins.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Delta,Used my skymiles to upgrade to Premium Economy...good move...very comfy though it is pricey paying with dollars.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"missed the first, got the second","A Delta operator saved me from ""collaps"": I missed the outbound flight from JFK to PIT, because my previuos flight had a massive delay. In one of my far-away pocket I had the memory that if you miss the outbound you loose the inbound flight. My memory worked well, but a Delta operator on the phone was so concerned abt my situation (it was not my fault indeed), that he redeemed my return flight. I don't remember the name of this kind gentleman, but i do thank him a lot!!! Flying Delta was an excellent experience: cleaness and kindness of the staff (both in the air and at the airport) worth it!!!!"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,STILL THE BEST,Still the best airline around. Second to none. Always on time Their check in is a breeze. Never a problem with them
Date of travel: June 2019,50,Delta,Excellent service this is the only direct flight to JFK from Glasgow and it’s great to have a direct flight instead of needing  a stopover and change .
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great travel,The airport both were fast and easy. The airline was great and accommodating. I had a small child they ensured we were seated next to each other
Date of travel: February 2020,30,A delay now and then - but 2 to 4 delays per flight home!,Everytime i turned around I was getting a new text telling me each of my 2 flights home  was delayed (again)!
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Friendly flight attendants and tasty food,The flight attendants were very friendly and helpful on the Paris to Cincinnati segment.  The always available snacks and beverages are helpful on the long flights.  Delta now has a very pleasing presentation for the meals.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Non-Stop JFK to Mumbai,"A 15.5 hour flight is in itself overwhelming to think about.  However, if you are traveling from the US to India or vice versa, this is the flight you want.Delta Airlines recently (a couple of months ago) began a non-stop flight from JFK to Mumbai (Bombay, India).  We had premium economy seats, and they were fantastic.  There was extra leg room for starters, a foot rest for reclining, and other amenities, but the seat and the leg room were the most important.  The crew was terrific both on the flight to Mumbai and the one back to JFK. The best by far was Cindy.  I had leg cramps at one point, and she was quick to get me some tonic water. It has quinine for leg cramps--just what I needed.  We also saw her in the JFK airport  between flights, and she wanted to know if we were going to make our connecting flight to Nashville.  Customer service is about a thing of the past, but now with these crews and Cindy!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Delivering on their Commitment,"Delta makes many commitments to be your airline of choice.  Making such commitments and delivering on them is too different things.  On my flight from Atlanta to Denver, Delta delivered on all their commitments.  Kept on the schedule with an urgency that did not sacrifice customer service.  Kept on their commitment to deliver ""exceptional customer"", choice of food was excellent, abundant portions served hot, relayed pertinent information on the status of the flight, my comfort regarding seat was fine and their commitment to deliver my luggage within twenty minutes, done deal.  Met all my expectations, exceeded my expectations."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Very good experience with a flight in November from Atlanta to Munich and back from Budapest except for Paris,"Delta did a great job especially being in the premium economy section . It was wonderful experience with Delta except for flying through Paris. I use a wheelchair in the airports and they did a super job in Atlanta both flying out of and into that airport. Paris was the worst experience I have ever had  they were rude , they yelled at us and left us sitting for over 45 minutes in a basement area and would not speak to us. When I asked when we may be moved to our gate they actually started screaming at us. It was horrible. I will say that Munich airport coming in on Delta is not handicap accessible, although not much of Europe is. But when we came in we had to ride a bus and walk up and down stairs and was not offered the wheelchair at all. Luckily I am able to walk short distances, but 3 people fell during the time it took us to get through customs. The same when leaving Budapest we needed to ride a bus to the airplane. FYI"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Smooth,The trip was so smooth the airline is always  very friendly  and safe. The pilots are always informative and I have never had any problems  with this airline and my husband has a problem with walking so they always have the help for him which I am total happy with them for this.
Date of travel: February 2020,30,acceptable price and,"Not bad price, they served food in 6-hour flight one time (it was bad ) there was entertainment but the internet I paid for was not working and the one they have free was also not working, way to go"
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Some seats don’t recline,"On the New York to Madrid portion of our flight, neither my seat nor my daughter’s seat reclined.  The seats in front and behind us were fictional.  As the flight was full, we were stuck with the seats we had."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Greenville to NYC,"great service, on time. attendants helpful and friendly. Pilot communicated a short delay on runway but arrived on time despite a slight delay."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,"Delta One makes 10+ hour flights bearable, sometimes even enjoyable.",As I've gotten older I appreciate 1st Class more and more.  Especially with Lie-flat seats.  It adds another useable day to any trip with an overnight flight since you can actually get a good nights sleep.  That combined with a shower in the 1st class lounge when you arrive makes Delta One worth every cent extra you pay over Economy or Comfort Class.
Date of travel: March 2020,40,JFK by Delta,We received great service from the baggage drop in and for the completion of our flight.  Airplane was clean and entertainment options were plenty.  They should reconsider snacks... not so good.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Delta does it again!,"Excellent flight in both directions, on Delta.  Premium economy got me the seats of my choice.  My only question was why my three travel companions, who were flying regular economy, were seated right beside me in the same area."
Date of travel: March 2020,30,Disappointed when Delta changed my seat and location on the plane,"Booked my travel and selected my seats on the aisle as close to the front as I was allowed without paying.  Without any notification, my seats for both flights were changed toward the back of the plane in a window seat.  The flight was fine.  I was told they switched aircraft and then they can reassign your seats."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,"On time, average service","On time, no big issues.Seats are getting tighter(I am average 5'9"" 185 lb)Aircrew is good. Food/snacks selection not so good."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"Orange Beach, AL","Flew from IAD to ATL to Pensacola and back.  All flights on time or early.  Friendly flight crews and great takeoffs and landings. Baggage checked through with phone notification that it had been loaded.  Timely arrival at baggage claim.  Best of all, a surprise upgrade to Comfort+ on the last leg of my flight home - very appreciative.  Nice job Delta!"
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Delta customer services is AWFUL!,"We checked 2 car booster seats.  The agent took them in one bag- I got one tracking number.  When we arrived there was only one booster in the bag. The gate agents tried to help us (we couldn’t leave the airport because we had 2 children) but their supervisor would let them give us a car seat. They said that we would have to go through regular channels for lost luggage!  The United agent, at the desk next to Delta, gave us vine of theirs so we could leave!  The process of lost luggage is so bad that I know that I will never get it recovered or get paid for it.  I have spent hours on the phone but because there was no tag and it shows that my bag got there (only one car seat in the bag).  Delta probably makes a lot of money on not having to pay out for lost or damaged luggage.  Not my first problem with Delta.  It seems that every time we fly Delta something come up.  I will do my best to not to fly Delta, again!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great first class service,"Delta has really stepped up their first class. Only issue is for first class, your luggage is supposed to be priority but we have found that ours is usually the last off the plane. Great food and seats are very comfortable."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Vacation flight to FL,"On time, sat in seats we had selected, free movies, friendly flight attendants, but jammed in tight of course."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Back to winter !,"Both flights were great. Flight and airport personnel were kind, considerate and very helpful. We were designated medical assistance,  and the Delta staff took care of us.  It was a very good experience."
Date of travel: May 2019,10,Cancellation Policy Stinks,"Delta's Flight Cancellation Policy is horrible. Maybe it is similar to other domestic airlines, maybe not. But I was forced to cancel my trip to Barcelona and was told by customer service I had a year to book a flight to be able to apply the credit.  Well, NOT SO!  When I tried to apply the credit to another flight, I was told I could not because all of my travel had to be completed by 365 days from the day I booked the original flight. I spoke with supervisors and then managers and Delta's policy is what I was told when when I tried to use the credit. Ultimately, I lost over $5K and was not very happy."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Sit back and relax,Sit back and relax and let someone else drive. The staff was friendly. Flight was on time. Good selection of movies to watch to help pass the time. Overall had a good experience
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Great Flight,"Flight was great,comfy seats in economy and good in flight entertainment. Staff not overly attentive, if you wanted a drink you had to go to the back and ask. I would fly Delta again though"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Trip to Italy,"Our flight to and from Italy on Delta was great. Smooth flight and great service!  However, it was crowded!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Loved Delta,"They really do reward loyalty to their airline, but for my first time on, i was impressed with the airline and what they offer.   Loved the free movies!!  excellent customer service after the fact.  My bag was damaged and they made good on it right away."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Main cabin is soooooooo cramped.,"Took an overnight flight to get more favorable pricing. Will NEVER do that again unless in first class. This was a 757, so not a jumbo, but not a small plane either. Seating is so badly cramped, at 5'10"", my knees were jammed into the seat ahead of me and my seat would only recline about 2"". Literally impossible to sleep, and you walk off the plane with neck and back cramps. Unless you are 5'5"" or shorter and weigh under 150 lbs, you will be hurting after 5+ hours of being in straight jacket-like seating."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,From Atlanta to Mumbai,"I have been flying from Atlanta to India for over 30 years.  Delta has flights to Mumbai and Bangalore  - at this time.  I recently flew on DL codeshare partner Virgin Atlantic - from ATL to London was a non-plus flight, nothing terrific to share - London’s airport is weak - as is having to go through security again before the second leg of the flight to Mumbai...security rules in London are different and make little sense ....I would not fly this route again to India.  On the return, I flew Delta non-stop from Mumbai to JFK - a long 16hour flight, but Delta does all possible to make it comfortable...much easier not stopping in a Europe port - had no trouble at JFK with customs, immigration, to make connection to ATL - the particular flight I was on from JFK to ATL was delayed 4 hours - I think that is an anomaly so I will let it pass - Qatar has a good flight from ATL to Mumbai or most international ports in India which is cost effective and time effective - I always look at what they offer and have flown with them - which is comparable with Delta - Qatar has Delta beat with two stops  if you are flying into India somewhere other than Mumbai - Flight is from ATL to Doha  - then the second flight from Doha to most Indian International airports  - easy peezy...."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Great Airline,I was an Executive Platinum passenger with American for many years and am Platinum for life and then American stopped flying on the main route I travel and I was forced to travel Delta. The best thing that happened to me. Their vegetarian meals are superb.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,"Great service, smooth flight and Filet!!","I spent the extra for Comfort class and it was worth ever nickel when you are faced with a 9 hour flight and your 6'2"" 210 lbs. The seats were roomier than economy, i actually felt bad for the folks that were in the back by the bathroom. there were 3 guys that looked like they were on top of eachother. the meals on the flight were also good for a change. I was given the option of Filet that was great! best meal on a plane, and that includes a number of first class flights. the check in staff were friendly and fast. the stewardess was good but disappeared for what seemed to be a couple hours during the flight. I am one who is willing to pay for comfort and service."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,flight from PSP,"Equipment was good, service excellent, comfort excellent, food was excellent and flight was on time."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great flight,We had a great flight.  The entire crew were very supportive on all segments.  I was totally blown away.  I was disappointed that we had to refrain from peanuts on a 4-1/2 hour flight due to one individual in the back of the plane that had an allergy.
Date of travel: December 2019,30,"Problems, but attendant tried to make right","The plane was very dirty, the tray tables were filthy, so much so, that I did not even want to put my cup on there, or my kindle or my hands for that matter.  The flight attendant tried to make it right however, because at first he offered me a ""wet wipe"" but then said they couldn't get one for me because they were in the middle of service, so he gave me a couple of free beers.  I appreciated that, but would prefer to be able to put my hands down on the table when trying to eat a snack or drink a beverage, or put any of my personal belongings on there."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Great flight!,The Delta flight was on time and comfortable. All of the crew members were friendly and helpful.  Overall positive experience.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"Outstanding cabin staff, immaculate Boeing 777s","The long-range Boeings were smooth as silk, but even more polished were the fantastic cabin crew, all helpful, smiling and efficient."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Spring retreat,"I have been flying Delta so many years. As an American Express Centurion and Delta Platinum Medallion I have upgrade privilegesThe DElta staff very nice they try to address you by names whenever you go.Check in agent, gate agent, flight attandent so you feel home. I flew to Atlanta then West Palm Beach and reverse. All section are upgrade and they try to do it until the last mintes when we board.The movies in plane are grade with TV srceen everywhere. and I have free WIFI and messenger in flight due to T Mobil service. This is a great airlines. Dr Huu Vo"
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Delta still remains one of my favorite over its competition (United & American) .,"Delta still remains one of my favorite over its competition (United & American) .  attendants were nice, easy flight and the flight was on time, actually early into Atlanta.  Only issue which is common across the board is it is cramped.  I had an emergency aisle which I thought would be a great seat except the window seat was gone so basically an aisle and a middle seat so ended up being tight, I would just suggest taking a good look if the option is available and do not recommend this seat.  I still prefer SW due to the baggage allowance and wish the other airlines would get back on board"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,"Friendly, courteous and professional staff both groud and in flight","Service was excellent and equal to the flight crew that reflect a sincere desire to insure your comfort and in flight experience. I enjoy flying and having flown many airlines I must honestly rate Delta Airlines as the top tier. I thank the crew, again, both ground but especially in flight for a  wonderful flight experience."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Now My Fav Airline,Took the redeye. The flight left on time. It was full and boarding took a long time but the process was as smooth as possible. It's really the people who cause issues - not the flight crew. They offered a light blanked which I didn't use. Great selection of movies.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Excellent Overseas Experience,"We flew Delta from OKC to Atlanta to Amsterdam to Bristol.  Since OKC is not a main hub, that was the best possibility.  We flew Premium Economy and we must say that it was one of the nicest long-distance air flights that we have ever experienced.  The plane was clean and lovely, the service was excellent, the choice of movies was vast, and the food was good.  We experienced the same excellence when we returned, Bristol to Amsterdam, to Minneapolis to OKC.We will definitely choose Delta again."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Great flight-great landing,Excellent flight.  Flight attendants were very nice. Had good movies to watch. I like the snacks also.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,They made a customer for life,"This is the first time I have rated an airline, mostly because there are so many variables when it comes to air travel. However I felt that Delta’s customer service in this occasion was tremendous. This review is not relative to a single flight, one individual or the equipment they used. It is an overall review, and I have to say I rarely use the 5 stars because it usually never applies, except in this case. I had booked a month long trip to Singapore and Malaysia long before the coronavirus became an issue. We had booked flights from Canada to Singapore via South Korea. We also booked several regional flights with other airlines in Malaysia eventually returning to Canada via Delta.  Two weeks before traveling we reconsidered our trip to Asia because of the Coronavirus outbreak. One of the islands in Malaysia we were traveling to had quarantined travelers from China. I contacted Delta and literally within a 10 minute conversation that was understanding and extremely professional they had agreed to waive the change/cancellation fee and send me vouchers. The contrast when I contacted Jetstar(subsidiary of Quantas) and Asia Air was like night and day. I received no refund, voucher or chance to rebook within a year. Delta’s service only got better, calls to Agents to book a trip to Latin America instead of Asia went off without a hitch. They booked our flights on dates that were only days away. Agents were again professional and knowledgeable. As I stated earlier I have never rated an Airline before because of so many variables.  However Delta managed exemplary service that continued from ticket agents to flight attendants to ground personnel and equipment over 6 legs of travel and four Airports in three Countries."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Comfortable flight,"Although we were in basic, the flight was very comfortable and arrived ahead of schedule. The flight crew was excellent."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Great airline,"I flew to St. Thomas and back last week with Delta.  Very well organized.  On time both ways.  Friendly crew.  Assigned seats a big plus.  I'm partially handicapped, and everyone was very helpful.  A little problem in St. Thomas, however, since there are no ramp-type gates there.  I had to navigate a long set of roll-up stairs out of and into the plane. Thanks to some nice fellow passengers, who helped me with my roll-on luggage, I managed.  Don't know if the crew offered other options, since I didn't ask.  I'd fly with Delta again."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,"Reliable, courteous service","We flew on Delta from San Diego to Santiago de Chile via Atlanta. Our flights were on time. Ground staff and air crews were friendly and courteous. The boarding process in San Diego was a little chaotic, but went smoothly in Atlanta.In cabin service was attentive and frequent, even on the domestic segment. On the international leg, the meal service was nicely presented and the food looked and tasted better than the average business lass meal.Since Delta seems to mostly use Boeing 767 aircraft on their Lstin American service, business class seats are more reminiscent of luxury travel from a few decades ago. Nevertheless, we were able to sleep through the overnight flight."
Date of travel: March 2020,30,Long flight,Long flight but luckily we had lie flat seats.  Can pre select your meal in advance.Problem with this flight is that it arrives in LAX about 5:30 am and customs does notopen until 6 am.  So after a 14 hour flight you get there and have to wait on plane foranother 1/2 hour.  What’s up with that?
Date of travel: February 2020,50,It was comforting to fly Delta on one of the last flights out of Malpensa because of the virus,"To receive maximum benefits, I try very hard to consolidate all of my travel on one airline, and that is Delta. I left for Italy when the virus problem was not severe, but my scheduled return at the end of February, fortunately, was just in time. It was comforting to fly Delta on one of the last flights out of Malpensa because of the virus, because the level of organization is higher than on most other airlines."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Summer in Rio,"We fly Delta every time it is possibleWhen we can the miles help a loThe flight is always very smooth, on time and the service always very reliable and precise"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Excellent flight,"We flew from Dallas/Ft. Worth to LaGuardia in comfort plus. Great flight, left right on time, got in a few minutes early. Delta terminal at Lga is very nice. Good choice of media on board. Terrific job by the pilot and crew."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Weather Delays ugggghhhh,"The return trip home was plagued by weather delays but Delta was very helpful and even provided sandwiches, snacks and drinks in Charlotte NC after the flight was several hours delayed."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Delta International Flights from Asia -Terrible Service,"Terrible customer service and have consistently wasted my time with issues at the gate and having me ultimately miss my flights.They are better with domestic flights, but international flights are not good. They get worst with their sister airline, Korean Air. Would never fly with them again!"
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Trip to Florida,"Flight was great, seats not so much. I would rather have flown first class! Can't believe how cramped the spaces and aisles are! Plane was clean, attendants were nice."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Delta is very helpful,"We had mechanical issues in Sydney which ended up cancelling the flight from Sydney.  Since Delta has only one scheduled flight per day, they had to wait for the part to come the next day.  Once the plane was repaired, it took several hours for the passengers to board and the plane to take off.  We missed our connection to our nonstop to Tampa, but Delta helped with rescheduling the flight for the next day."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Will definitely recommend to friends and relatives,Food served in large portion. Wide variety of drinks. Flight was above my expectation. The crew are nice and friendly  Departure was on time and arrival was ahead of schedule.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Comfort + worth it,Short co for table flight for 6 ft 4 in guy.  First time paid extra for Comfort + And definitely worth it for the leg room.  Flight attendants were top notch
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Delta has outstanding customer service,"I’m always impressed with the customer service that Delta provides.  They are efficient, professional, and friendly.  Employees convey a sincerity that is refreshing."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,I got bummed to exit rows for free,"I am a big guy, and most airplanes are very cozy for me. I asked if I could be ""upgraded"". They gave me the emergency exit row and didn't ask for the upgrade fee"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,MSP without doubt easiest U.S. Entry point,"Over the past two years we have flown to/from Euope twice and to/from Dominican Republic once.  We have always flown Delta and/or their partner airlines.  On-board service is way above average;  boarding process is quick and easy;  gate agents are continually updating passengers in the waiting area.The best part of our latest flight (PUJ to FSD) was the ease of the customs process back into the U.S. at Minneapolis/St. Paul (MSP) airport.  From the time we got off our first flight until we were seated at our connecting gate was only 35 minutes.  They had a number of folks on hand to help passengers expedite their customs experience.  Compare this to 2 1/2 hours at JFK and 2 hours at DTW (Detroit).  The JFK process was like an out of control ""cattle call"";  Detroit personnel were just plain rude to everyone.If you have your choice of re-entry airports, (probably mainly for travelers from the midwest), you won't do any better than flying Delta and re-entering through Minneapolis/St. Paul."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Comfortable flight,"Nice stewardess and good selection of food and drink.  Haven’t flown Delta for years, pleasantly surprised.  I had an exit row which I did pay extra for."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Comfort Plus? Perfect for long or medium haul flights!,"Delta’s Comfort Plus seating is perfect for people with longer legs like me.. Well worth the extra $$$, with priority loading and dedicated overhead locker space which is often a problem in economy. Wonderful attentive and polite cabin crew made the SYD to LAX flight pleasant and very comfortable!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,I may never fly another airline!  Love Delta!,"I was returning from a vacation in Italy taking the worst airline Alitalia to Rome and Delta back home through JFK then to Tampa.  I loved the way the seats were situated with two on each side and 4 in the middle.  We sat in a row of 2 seats.  From the very beginning in our economy seats, we were given first class treatment starting with giving everyone a hot towel then a placemat for your tray including plastic silverware that could actually cut chicken without breaking.  We were also offered bottled water - full bottles.  They came around giving free earbuds, pillows, blankets, and sleep kits including ear plugs, wipes, and a sleeping mask.  The media center offered great movie options, too.  Recent movies!  Worked perfectly.  Our 8 hour flight was really a 10 hour flight to JFK due to bad winds and it was a bumpy ride but no complaints.  We were then offered an appetizer, entree and dessert along with any cocktail.  The chicken was delicious!  I know, shocking!  The salted caramel ice cream was also delicious.  No complaints.  They later came through to offer another drink before we settled in to sleep.  Unfortunately, we sat close to the restrooms so we did get some bad odors on occasion.  I will try to avoid this area in the future.  After a while, we were served warm cookies and another drink.  Then, another hot towel and a quick entree with dessert.  The BBQ chicken pizza pocket had too many jalapenos in it and was way too spicy but still tasty.  The service is amazing.  For your second entree, you got another clean placemat!  Like I mentioned, first class service!  I will definitely fly Delta again.   On my JFK to Tampa flight, it was quick and of course, only snacks and sodas are available for free.  The flight was fine, comfortable.  Somehow, the type of ticket I bought did not allow me to pre-select my seats until boarding without an additional cost.  Not sure why this is a thing.  We were lucky our flight wasn't full as the 4 of us could have been separated."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Landed Early Each Way,Staff were friendly and professional. Snacks were limited but soft drinks were not. Take off and landings were fine and the plane was clean. Movies were free and current.
Date of travel: March 2020,20,"Late, Late, Late","The aircraft arrived one hour late to Monroe. During unloading and loading another plane pancaked (landed without landing gear) on the only runway available so we disembarqued  and re-loaded after a wrecker pulled the other plane off the runway and the runway was cleaned of debris.  The crash was not Delta's fault but if it had been on time, it could have left before the accident."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Montana to Alaska,"Having flown over a million miles with Delta I have always been treated with respect from everyone from the Ticket counter, gate to the flight crews. The service has always been consistant and good."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Basic Services,"We travelled on a Boeing 737-800. The plane was very basic. It had no modern amenities.  Entertainment is offered through an app. But there is no power supply available on the plane, so if you plan on using your phone, bring a reserve power supply.Staff seemed as though they were being inconvenienced by our being there.  I found them to be blunt and curt with their interactions with the passengers. On a 5 hour flight, there was no snacks offered; only drinks, and only once during the flight. By the time they got to us, there was nothing substantial available to purchase.This happened on both flights to and from."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Enjoyable Flight,There was plenty of leg room plus I liked that the armrests on the aisle seats lifted up for easier accessing of sear..
Date of travel: February 2020,50,GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE,"We experienced extraordinary customer service on this flight from San Diego to Detroit.  As my 68 year old husband struggled to get off the plane with his luggage and cane, the pilot offered him her arm to step off and carried his luggage all the way from the plane to the terminal.It has been our experience that Delta makes it easier for people with disabilities to get the appropriate seats they need, etc."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Never flying Delta again,"Got to Cancun airport super early. Found out last minute that Delta flight was delayed due to mechanical failure. Even though flight was delayed the process was confusing. My boarding ticket said one time and one gate, the airports monitors said something completely different. Only thing I liked was the tvs everyone has on their chairs. I am never flying delta again because their last minute delayed flight made me miss my connecting flight and delta didn't do anything to help. Even though they didn't even arrive at the time they were supposed to arrive at. I was stranded at the airport for a bit until  I could figure out how I was going to get from Florida to North Carolina. Their customer service team didn't help at all. Delta said it wasn't their fault for me missing my connecting flight when in fact it was. I would highly recommend not flying delta because I talked to a few of the airport workers and they all said Delta was almost always late or delayed. Delta doesn't even follow their own policies."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,flight attendance were very mindful of travelers and very attentive to our needs.,"Every thing was fine. food could  have been better. all though i received an e-mail regarding my preference for lunch and breakfast on return flight, still not to my liking."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,COZUMEL,"GREAT TRIP Airline was great  Good  Flight all was good great Crew  Smooth flight , Connection to Cozumel was the better flight and wonderful Crew!"
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Our Last Leg,"I am a frequent flyer with Delta.  Our most recent trip was to Costa Rica.  The flight there was great as was the flight back where we had a connection in Los Angeles.  This flight was not at all like the others.  The plane was filthy, the sevice was mediocre, and several of the flight attendents were crusty with very snotty attitudes.  I pay alot for first class and expected better service.  As a customer I also expected to be treated with way more respect.  It was not a good experience."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Flight to San Diego by Delta,"Everything went seamless....From checking in with children & luggage, the movies were great!   Service & smooth flights."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Smooth Flight,"This was a combination trip of business & leisure.  First of all, this trip was set up in the spare of the moment, therefore, I couldn't plan anything my company told me to get a seat on the next flight.  Having said that, the only seat available was in first class and I had to fly from Phoenix, AZ, to Atlanta, GA then to San Juan Puerto Rico.  Unquestionably, it was the best smooth flying going and returning, the service that I received from Delta staring with the Sky Mile lounge, was excellent as well as the flights itself.  Delta's attention to detail and comfort was on point, to say the least."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great flight to Jamaica,"Our experience with Delta was great. From customer service to the flight crew,they exceeded our expectations and they were high to begin with."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Superb customer service,"This flight was completely overshadowed by the fact that my wife was taken I'll during the flight. The cabin crew could not have been better, they moved her to a staff jump seat at the rear of the plane, supplied her with oxygen and made sure she had someone with her all the time."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Always On Time,I take the 6am flight and it's always on time and many times arrives early. I've never had any problems.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,No issues with Delta,"Fly delta a lot, good prices and you get one carry on and a personal item for free. Free messaging is nice too."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Great flight!,"Great flight. Seats were comfortable; staff was fantastic. In-flight entertainment options are good. I would definitely recommend Delta. It's been a while since I've flown them since I moved away from their more heavily serviced routes, but it really is one of the better airlines that I've flown. Good experience overall."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Interesting differences on legs of flight,"This was our return flight home from Hawaii.  The flight from Honolulu to LAX was overnight and was comfortable. Headphones and blankets (sealed in plastic) were distributed, so with the headphones in, blanket on and wifi connected, all at no additional cost, I was able to rest.  The surprising part of the trip home came when we were on the flight from LAX to Nashville, except for the blanket everything else was offered for a fee.  Blankets were not offered. I was confused by the airline offering the same service but sometimes it was free and sometimes it was not. I was on an exit row, leg room was great, I would say average in a standard row."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,One of the worst...,The worst food I have ever eaten on a flight =-- totally unedible.  . Walk from gate at JFK to baggage pickup was way too long.  Took a good ten minutes.  Everyone was complaining.  I will do everything possible not to book a Delta flight.
Date of travel: March 2020,30,Flight to Nashville,"The terminal was very uncomfortable and devoid of basic amenities (how about outlets to charge cell phones). Seats were uncomfortable and terminal was generally dirty and unkempt. Once on the plane the crew, both flight and cabin, were very good. Given the lack of food options at the terminal any snack would be welcome but a bag of almonds was less than desirable. Good thing it was a short flight. Aircraft was neat and flight crew kept us updated on arrival time. Airport at Nashville BNA was fine with quick luggage pickup."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,"Excellent, always on time and the best schedule for Europe.","I used to travel to Europe for Business with another US Airline, then 12 years ago I start using Delta because of their Itineraries and convenience.  As of today I don’t have any complaints and use Delta for Personal and Business trips."
Date of travel: May 2019,30,"the flight was long and the palne was not clean, service was ok, but I feel asleep as soon as we were in the air.","flight was long, it arrived ahead of schedule, so that made up for the plane not being clean and the poor service"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,"Richmond, VA - a great airport","I had meetings in central and northern Virginia, and opted to avoid the larger airport and selected Richmond, VA instead. What a great experience. Being from Atlanta and typically dealing with very large airports, it was a welcome treat to land, walk directly to my rental car on the airport property; same benefit with the return. Quick and easy. As always, it was a great Delta flight and flight crew - with the added benefit of a really pleasant, smaller airport. Thanks Richmond!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Comfort Plus to Tokyo and Back -- Great flights!,"My wife and i recently flew RT from Minneapolis to Tokyo [Haneda airport] on Delta's Comfort Plus seating [I guess that would be considered Premium Economy, per the menu options offered on Tripadvisor].  In any case Comfort Plus was a modest upcharge on top of the basic economy class, but WELL WORTH IT!  Why?  First, you get a few extra inches in seat pitch, which matters a LOT to me at 6' 3 inches.  I've had three other international flights in the past year, and the space on Delta's Comfort Plus is a significant plus factor.  [One of those flights -- a miserably cramped seat just BEHIND the exit row....UGH!...was on a prominent international carrier based out of Frankfurt.  SEHR enttäuschend --- a great disappointment!]The entertainment system offered on Delta is top-notch, with dozens of current and older films and TV series loaded on each invidividual seat screen; plus game play if you like....although in fairness, I think these advanced entertainment packages are becoming more standard on int'l flights.Finally, the professional quality of the flight crew to and from Tokyo was first-rate.  We loved the caring, pampering service, and enjoyed the courtesy and conversatoin of the crew.  We can't recall flights that were more comfortable, and dare we say, FUN, than with Delta.  Cheers to Linda and Renee!Last point: take note of the Haneda [Tokyo] destination.  Much closer (20 minutes) to downtown Tokyo than distant Narita [75 minutes], the sole international airport for years.  Try the HND connection!"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Great service on board,This was an unexpected surprise when on this trip the cabin crew was remarkably help. They came through the cabin twice to offer snacks and beverages. Plus another walk through with cups of water in between.  Really didn't expect that much as the flight was schedule to be three and half hours long.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Visit to family,Haven’t travelled delta for some time. It was a very pleasant trip - the food exceptionally good for airline  travel. Seats comfortable. We were lucky there were so few passengers sO we each could  have  4 seats so easy to get some sleep. Would travelDelta again
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Overall Good Experience,Flew round trip to South Carolina and back after a two week visit.  Delta flights were all on time except for one which was not due to any Delta issue but a destination was fogged in.  Had a one hour delay.  We still made our connection with an hour to spare.  All our flights landed on time or up to a half hour early with that one exception.  Overall a very good experience.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,ALWAYS COMFORTABLE,"I like the ease of knowing my seat ahead of time. The planes are always clean and the staff is very friendly. I love flying to Seattle and Spokane. Easy on, easy off"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Excellent Customer Service,"When a recent trip got me to the airport for the return home eight hours before my flight due to circumstances beyond my control, Delta customer service helped me get on an earlier flight in spite of my ticket class. The flight I was booked on was oversold, but the one leaving in 45 minutes had lots of empty seats. I helped Delta and they helped me - it might have cost them money if they had to pay someone to give up their seat on the later flight. The customer service rep understood my point, and got me on to the earlier flight just in time to board."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Fabulous Trip,"Everything was excellent. Flight attendants were friendly, cheerful & helpful. No turbulence round trip. Could not be better."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,"Non-stop to San Jose, Costa Rica","Delta is always our airline of choice.  I do appreciate the organized way of boarding and the fact that they work hard to have flights on time.  As with many other airlines, I believe they have sized down the regular economy seats beyond acceptable, so our flying is never a bargain."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Delta airlines just never Disapoint,"I fly back and forth to the states a lot. I always try to fly on Delta. The crew is super friendly and serviceminded, the cabins are updated (even in their old 767s) , the food is good ... I love this airline.When i say this i have also flown on all other airlines flying from europe and USA. Not even lufthansa comes close."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Exceeds my expectations,The in-flight  entertainment is such a bonus of flying with Delta. The free snacks are quite decent and the air stewards are very kind.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,As good as any,"Delta is working to make flying a) more accessible, b) less awful, and c) more expensive. You  now have three separate price levels in coach. Unless it's a transcon flight, go for the cheapest: it's all the same except for a little more legroom at the priciest level."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Flying Home,"Love flying with Delta, good service and no middle seat on the sides. They treated me with respect and everyone was very friendly."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Excellent airline,I mainly  fly Air Canada but chose Delta as it had a direct flight to Salt Lake from Toronto. Everything from check in and on board was excellent and a pleasant experience. The food was very good. I had their steak. I flew United from Toronto to San Francisco-Hawaii in Nov. and will never use them again. Have nothing good to say about United and all of my past Delta flights have been excellent over the years.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Flying Delta With No Fear,"I took the red eye today, from Orland to New York Laguardia Airport. Delta has been my go to airline lately. They are better organized at the gate. Excellent on rime performance; today we were at least 15 minutes early. The plane look well cleaned inside! The entire staff was very professional and helpful!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Weather related flight,Flight was on time. Arrived early in Atlanta. The cabin was clean. The flight attendants were very courteous and neatly dressed.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"Very smooth, 21 hour flight, managed to grab some sleep","Air France and Delta handled their respective  leg of journey excellently.  They had my special meals ready, and in flight entertainment was not too shabby.  The layover Charles DeGaulle airport was just right at two hours. Will definitely use this airline in the month of March. Will look for options to other cities in India from Raleigh Durham, NC."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Always professional,"Delta has consistently been the most reliable, professional, and safe airline that I have dealt with over the past 25 years.  Whether it's main cabin or first class the professionalism from check in to takeoff and arrival is consistently respectable.  The flights are rarely delayed and I feel like I can maintain some dignity and I am not just cattle.  Cabins are clean and the air seems clean and not humid or stagnant.  Seats are comfy.  The Cincinnati to Phoenix roundtrip direct flight is easy.  Never had significant problem with baggage claim.  Occasionally, my ""priority"" luggage comes off late instead of early but that's not usually more than a 5 minute difference."
Date of travel: August 2019,40,Anniversary Get Away,"This early morning flight was full. It was August and many families were getting in that last bit of vacation before school. But the weather was perfect, the flight was on time, and the passengers were happy. The cabin crew did a good job looking after all of us. We arrived with time to spare to get our luggage, rental car and out of town for a Smoky Mountain getaway."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Excellent Flights,"Very impressed with Delta-punctuality,excellent crew& meals served healthier than usual.Alcoholic beverage- good quality!Very comfortable flight"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Very impressed,Best transatlantic economy flight I have had. Decent sized seats. Lots of extras that you don't get on most economy flights. Have used BA and United in recent years. Hot towel and eye shades for first time in years and a welcome Bellini. Food was fine and snacks and extra drinks available at rear of cabin. It helped that flight was only 2/3rds full but staff made time for a chat. Put last BA flight to shame...
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Exceptional experience.,"I have Silver Medallion status as a result of using my Delta American Express card and using it for Delta purchases. I was first moved to Comfort Plus prior to the flight from Main Cabin 1, providing extra leg room. Then prior to boarding I was moved for First Class. It's a real treat for me and wonderful experience to receive this accommodation."
Date of travel: March 2020,30,Can't take anything for granted,"Flight was unilaterally changed from a pretty decent itinerary to one going through Atlanta (of course), substantially lengthening the travel time.Then the flight was cancelled, without even a hotel voucher, re-booked to the next day.Cabin staff was erratic (some really wonderful, others like the bossy aunt you used to hate)."
Date of travel: April 2019,50,MY FAV AIRLINE,I LOVE DELTA!! I have flown both first class and economy and I have nothing bad to say about either. Great staff and great experience overall
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Delta One is Excellent ,"My wife and I often fly to Southern California from our Boston area home. We like the Delta One BOS/LAX service and recommend it. This is Delta’s premium category with lay flat seating and those comfy pods and good infotainment. The food is much better than most and the flight crews are typically great. Not inexpensive, but reasonable for the level of service they provide. We dedicate our AmEx points to those flights for discounted fares and an occasional “free” one."
Date of travel: August 2019,20,Very Disappointed in Delta,"I usually fly economy but decided to treat myself to biz class over to Prague. The flight from LAX to JFK was fine. The JFK flight not so much. First, the seat that I had reserved was not given to me at the gate. It was a solo pod. Agent couldn't answer why this happened. The entertainment system in my ""new"" pod did not work AND the internet did not work. THIS IS NOT BUSINESS CLASS service. I spent $2500 for those seats. I had to write twice to the Delta CEO to get any response. It was some BS letter, sent with a Delta flight certificate for $200. I will NOT be flying Delta any time soon."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Worst service ever,"FCO was the worst airport I’ve ever been at. Disorganized, no directions, security doesn’t exist. We waited in line to check bags for 2 hours, as there was no employees working at the time we were told to arrive (3:30 for a 6:20am flight). Once we checked bags, we were told they were checked through to Miami. We changed planes in Atlanta, and a passenger overhead me tell my family that the bags were checked through to Miami. Luckily, that passenger informed me that we had to retrieve our bags in Atlanta and physical hand them to the attendant in Atlanta, or we would never see them again. We literally had to take the bags off the cart, wheel then across the hall, and put them on a conveyor belt (yes an attendant is watching). Bottom line, FCO is terrible, security there is a joke, the employees don’t care, and double check where your bags end up."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Very Accommodating Service,"We used to fly United, but a few years ago we switched to Delta due to very poor customer service on and off the plain.  Delta's crews are very accommodating to our needs and always polite."
Date of travel: November 2019,20,flying with dogs,Usually i would give Delta 5 stars. This trip was different. On the Atlanta to Detroit part of the journey 2 people got on the airplane with their 80+ pound dogs. Clearly the airline did not charge the couple for extra seats as the other passengers in first class had to make room for these dogs(although well behaved) to lay down.  These 2 selfish passengers took advantage of the others in first class and the airline went along with it  For shame
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Happy Oldies,This was an excellent flight. Cabin crew very helpful and professional. Lots of space and leg room and the food was especially nice.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,50th anniversary,"Nice flight, no trouble, we are older, wore support hose and took baby aspirin before flight, very wise,needed help to gate between flights, just ask when you get off plane, seating was tight but tolerable, professional!"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Family connections,Flights where on time and I always find staff friendly and helpful. Only thing I find a problem is that as a six foot tall person the MD88 from Atlanta to Toronto was so tight that the seat in front dug into my knees. I always pay for a seat but find it very costly to  have to upgrade to premium seating in order to have room to sit.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Flight Attendants were fantastic,"Delta Airlines is the Best Airlines, Friendly and Professional from the time you check in till you get off the flight! Very impressed with the Flight Crews"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Excellent Flight,This was an excellent flight! The flight crew was friendly and professional and the first class experience was awesome as always....keep up the good work Delta!
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Roman Holiday,"I have only flown Delta Airline when going to Europe as they have a number of flights out of Baton Rouge that connect to international flights from Atlantq.  Our flights have always been on time, staff are friendly and helpful and bags have only been late one time.  The only problem is their co-share partners service is not always as good as Delta."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,J Kelly nyc,"They were fantastic both ways , food was great & service was top notch . Highly recommended 👌🏻Would fly with them again anytime"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Comfortable flight,"Comfortable flight , friendly crew members and good inflight entertainment. Great value for money. I will definitely be travelling with them again"
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Arrogant and Mediocre Airline,"I have some experience with DL before in economy that wasn't that great... but this one it was pretentious and arrogant attitude by the on board crew and the airport employees, mostly at ATL. NO LOUNGE use  and I was flying internationally to LIR (different from AA and UA that access to lounge is granted flying in J) I mentioned that to the guy at the ATL lounge and he said "" we don't compare to those airlines""  now I understand, they are even worst than AA and UA. I flew AA from MIA and it was fantastic service, great meal that you can order since you make the reservation, Flagship Lounge use at MIA, so corteous and helpful crew and employees at the airport.. WHAT A DIFFERENCE from the arrogant mediocre DELTA"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Excellent timely trip,As always Delta performed   On time and good service.  Ample connection time and even stayed in same concourse in Atlanta.  Wish they had more than one daily flight to Eagle Co.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Empty Flight,We were retiring from a 16 day in southeast Asia and this was our flight back to the states.  The plane was less than  1/3 full due to health concerns.  The flight was great the service exceptional.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Quick flight arrived 30 minutes early,"I travel between CVG and EWR quite frequently and it's always a direct flight.  I flew on 3-5-20 and left CVG at 5:37pm and was supposed to arrive at 7:47 and I got to the gate in EWR at 7:11pm.  Flying into EWR is usually delayed and is never on time, this time it was the exception.  I always fly Delta and I'm usually very happy with the results, they're very friendly and I'll continue to fly Delta exclusively."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Small plane from SNA to SEA...and it was great.,"The plane was a regional jet (2x2 in the main cabin).  The flight was comfortable, smooth and easy.  I'd definitely recommend the flight."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Comfortable Flight,Out going flights were Economy+ and were both on time.  Return flights were First Class due to a great upgrade option.  Flight was behind schedule leaving SJO-ATL which caused a n issue with our bag making our connecting flight.  Our bags didn't show up at our destination until the next day.  Overall the flight was great value and comfortable
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Delta meets my expectations,"Delta continues to provided professional and personal feeling service.  The aircraft appears clean (as can be with quick turn arounds).  However, the other airlines on non-stops never meet our expectations.  Same this time from Atlanta to Halifax"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Excellent Service and Favorite Airline,"We recently switched miles programs from United to Delta, and our only regret is not doing this sooner. The quality of the airplanes and general service is far superior on Delta. The planes seem newer and better maintained, the flight attendants are friendlier and, best of all, we seem to be earning rewards at a much faster pace. Case in point, we were able to use miles to upgrade to business class on our recent flight from Boston to Heathrow. We were seated in the bulkhead of the business class cabin, which previously has involved exposure to more noise from the galley area. We were slightly concerned about this, as it was an overnight flight and we really wanted to sleep. The cabin crew were so professional and quiet, so we didn't really notice much noise from the galley. This was a Delta One flight so we had the lay flat seats and a retractable privacy wall. The seat was comfortable, the entertainment screen was huge and the meals were delicious. A big perk was that we received a special card right before we landed which we could present at a special expedited customs line. This was a huge help, as it saved a ton of time and hassle having to go through the large regular line. Highly recommend Delta and, of course, Delta One."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,First family trip and my daughters (6 years old) first flight,"I chose delta for our first family trip and my daughters first flight. Pre-flight the Captain gave a little talk about how the airline avoids turbulence which was interesting. I like that in first class you can get a drink before takeoff. During the flight the attendants took some extra time and effort to make a crown of cookies, with a delta flight pin, to celebrate a child first flight (there were 2 on my flight.) I love Delta's in-flight entertainment, they have a great selection (my daughter was entertained for the whole flight.) The food/snack selection has a good variety with some healthy choices. They also let my daughter have an extra snack when she ask for one."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,non stop boston to cancun,on time great flight no problems...always fly non stop to cancun because if there is astop returning to us need to get bags off plane and lug them to immigration and reboard
Date of travel: February 2020,40,What’s To Say About an Airline,"We have been fling Delta exclusively for 15 years. That is about to end. Every year we go to Key West and have to change in Atlanta, a huge airport. Every year we have to go from the middle or end of a concourse to the middle or end of another concourse. It is always fraught. It is a long trek. I recently found that another competitive airline flies directly three times a day from Newark to Key West and return. Guess who I am flying with next.Each year I asked Delta for a direct flight in my survey. Never have I received a rely.So, I wish I could say it’s been nice Delta but I can’t. But I can say goodby."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,DL Connection really has it going well,"The Delta Connection has vastly improved over the years.  The cabin crew and cockpit crew could not be nicer.  The snack basket makes for a very modest in-flight food service but it's bottomless and served with a smile.  And, the aircraft have been super-duper clean."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Best flight experience!,"Using points I upgraded to Comfort +, and was not disappointed with the upgrade at all!  More leg room and drinks during the flight made it a nice experience.  Flight left and arrived on time, and the level of customer service was excellent.  Will be flying Delta as much as possible."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"Excellent service, all top class and super easy, non stop from Los Angeles to Costa Rica in 5 or so easy hours!",Our non stop flight to Costa Rica from LA was a breeze. I have to say after that experience I’ll definitely be choosing Delta more often!
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Very comfortable,"Comfortable, free drinks and food. Easy check-in in I’m Mexico City. Free delivery of bags forgotten in Atlanta customs."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Very Good,Thank you to the helpful flight attendants.  The pilots who delivered us smoothly and on time. We had plenty of food and drink. I appreciate Delta for always providing plenty of water!
Date of travel: March 2020,50,On time departure and arrival,Delta is doing a wonderful job of on time departure and arrival.  Flight attendants are generally courteous and helpful.  Exit row seats in economy are your best bet for comfort!
Date of travel: March 2020,30,Average business class level for a long haul trip,"Really funny and kind captain, saying hello to each passenger, one by one. Something I have never seen before.Travel bag pretty complete. The food was not the best I've had in business class, but it usually happens with almost all North American airlines, so it is not surprising. Well-stocked entertainment system with newly released movies (many of them in Latin American Spanish). One of the most remarkable things was the extraordinary well organised boarding process."
Date of travel: March 2020,30,Business Travel,"Delta needs to setup their sanitation between flights with this coronavirus epidemic going around.  it was apparent no one wiped anything down between flights out of Atlanta to San Antonio, TX.  Shame on you!!"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Only airline we will use,We have flown different airlines and Delta is what consider the best. On time- dependable- plenty of leg roo. We do not feel like cattle put into a pen. The attendants from Check in to on the flight are customer focused.  We flew Frontier once and never again - flew put of Detroit and the Check in was terrible - the clerks didn't care about the customers - everyone in the line was complaining - Fly Delta they value their customer
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Delta Flight,"8 hour flight to Ireland from Atlanta crammed into a sardine can. One member of our party is handicapped and Delta staff could not have been more kind and helpful on the ground.  Transportation through the airport, upgraded seating, pre-boarding but the flight was tough.  The passengers were packed into the plane like sardines.  The crew spent so much time distributing meals, snacks, blankets, pillows, hot towels, head phones, cookies etc. that they had little time for the passengers questions and needs."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Almost went,"An almost flight. Booked in February to fly in May, Houston to a conference at Palm Springs, CA. Just happened to go on line to Delta to update my profile to include my new ""known traveler"" id number. What do you know? My connecting flight in Salt Lake City was changed - scheduled to depart several hours before my flight from Houston landed. No notification from Delta - although they have phone, email, address, etc. Thank you, Delta. We won't be flying."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great flight,"Great service very friendly, helpful, and respectful. They know what to do in all situations, wish all airlines were like this"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Delta Comfort Class,"Our flight going out was very good, I really recommend Comfort class because you're in the front of the plane you have a little bit of extra room. On our return flight the stewardess that waited on us was rude and bordered on belligerent. I asked for a gin and tonic and she again got even ruder."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Delta has really kicked up its service! Thanks Delta!,I’ve been flying Delta regularly now for a year and am impressed by the overall increase in positive customer service from agents to flight attendants to pilots. On a flight one evening during inclement weather our pilot communicated extremely well while having to cut he for nearly 30 minutes before we were cleared to land. Upon decent all was good and we landed safely.
Date of travel: May 2019,30,"Flying Delta to Hiroshima, Japan.","The flight was not bad but being unable to fly into Kansai is a big issue.  Since there is only one way to get to Nagoya station from the airport you have to take a local train (meitetsu), it has little support for English speaking passengers.  It was very difficult for me to get a ticket, and I have been to Japan several times."
Date of travel: February 2020,20,"Overpriced, crowded",All together a greyhound bus is roomier and more comfortable.  I would like to see a video of passengers evacuating that airplane in an emergency.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Prefer to fly Delta,I have experienced that Delta does everything to be on time. This particular flight we landed into Atlanta 30 minutes earlier and my connecting flight was the next gate over. My luggage is handled so much better that other carriers. I will pay extra to fly Delta when I can.
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Heading home,This was our first trip on Delta in decades.  It was disappointing as compared to other airlines we’ve taken cross country. We flew out in 1st class-although aside from more leg room there wasn’t much 1st class in first class. Our homeward trip to SFO we flew economy.  The only selling point really was the non-stop flight.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Delta is by far my favorite airline,I always fly Delta and I always have the best experience. Delta's service is unmatched and their flights are always top notch. Their inflight entertainment via embedded touch screen is amazing. It makes those 3-6 hour flights manageable with the inflight movies/tv shows and games. The snacks are awesome and the beverages are always cold. They give you a second drink and dont make a stink about it like some other airlines might. The seats are comfortable and the attendants are professional and courteous!! Always fly Delta if you can. It's worth the 30-40 extra bucks.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Excellent.....AGAIN!,"I've come to expect great service from Delta, and they have surprised me on this trip.  I am handicapped, so I require a wheelchair to the gate.  What Delta has done is created a special check-in spot just for the handicapped.  You check-in and a wheelchair are provided at the same time.  Excellent idea!  I hope that this idea sticks around and is used in other airports that Delta flys to."
Date of travel: October 2019,10,Shared my seat with very large passenger,"I had a seat that the gentleman next to me was over half in the whole time. I discreetly asked to be moved up due to the discomfort of sitting next to this man as he was covering and sweating on my arm with his body while having his upper arms touching my chest half the time. I totally understand he is not comfortable either, but I left with a sweaty shirt from someone other than myself and was completely uncomfortable the whole time.I wish they would have let me move as I have seen happen on other carriers when seats are open like this instance. I am glad we have multiple approved carriers for our business travel as I have switched to them."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Normal flight,Normal fight. It was on time and not overbooked. Many seats were empty and the airplane was very comfortable.
Date of travel: April 2019,40,Pleasantly Surpised,I enjoyed my flight on Delta.  I would have given 5  but there was no in flight entertainment and I had to purchase the wifi and it takes forever to load.The crew was great.  The flight took off and landed on time we even got there a little early.  Will definitely fly delta again.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Germany Trip,I had a very pleasant experience flying Delta and then KLM in Amsterdam to Berlin.My itinerary had me going from Denver to Detroit and Detroit to Amsterdam and then on to Berlin. The seats were comfortable and the service was fantastic especially on the leg from Detroit to Amsterdam. Word of warning IF you fly thru Amsterdam it is a bear. I landed on one side of the airport and had to walk to the other side and it is a LONG walk. So Plan ahead if you take that route. They do have golf cart transportation but mine never showed.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Overall good flight,"for being a basic economy flight,  good service,  polite staff, the aircraft was clean on both legs of the trip. Boarding takes a long time with Delta having so many groups. Leg room was very tight, but that is to be expected."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Customer service is what Delta does,I fly between Tucson and Portland Maine a few times a year and have never had a bad experience with Delta. The customer service has always been excellent and as I am flying between smaller cities the whole airport experience is better.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Modern airplanes,"I absolutely love the entertainment on Delta.  You have your own private screen and are in charge of the media...be it hit movies, music, games, or watching your flight path.  Great way to pass the time."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Delta skies are friendly,"Our flight was reasonable.  However we didn't select our seats therefore 3 of the 4 flights we had, we were stuck in the very back of the plane.  it was fine, but not ideal.  Everything went pretty smooth for the most part.  No complaints."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Smoothest Trip to Florida,"I have flown many times to Gainesville FL to see my parents, and most of the time it is stressful and not an easy trip to navigate. For the first time though, I booked from Flint MI to Gainesville FL, normally start in Detroit MI. Delta from Flint was marvelous! The helpers were so friendly and the gates were so much closer together! This was the most stress free flight I have taken!"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Flight from Nashville to Orlando was great.,"I travel a lot with Delta.  I got most of my points with them, so I fight with them for points and friendliness.  As a retired military, I get on first and they allow you to move to different seats (if available).  With free WiFi, I can enjoy texting, etc.I'm flying to Italy in the summer with Delta Vacations and they did a get job in booking that trip.Enjoy!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,They provide a high level of service.  They are more on time than other airlines,"It was a basic ticket.  The steward was friendly.   They served their cookies and gave earphones out so you could watch movies.  There was adequate room, but no extra..."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Delta,The flight as fine. It is that the airlines these days are not really concerned about comfort and more on how many people on one flight they can get. Fortunately on thus trip there and back were good people and which made the flight more enjoyable. Seems like the late flights are better. People seem to be more relaxed.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,"On time, clean, great attention and service by crew","Flight was full, but on time and crew gave great service.  Smooth ride with good updates by pilots.  We fly Delta regularly and believe they are committed to those they serve--us their passengers!"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Great London Flight,"Wonderful staff, Great flight with great service ! Comfortable seating and leg room throughout the plane. Excellent headrest entertainment systems. Delta made it a very comfortable and enjoyable experience."
Date of travel: March 2020,30,Bathrooms on a plane,"Normally, I love Delta Airlines.... but the three star review is a protest for their use of the Airbus design with the lavatory in the center of the plane.  I understand the inclination... conventional wisdom would dictate that a lavatory in the center the plane would be more convenient for everyone on the flight.  However, that conventional wisdom would ignore the fact that the world is full of jerks.  It would ignore the fact, that there are some people who would go to that convenient lavatory and drop the mother of all duces in the first half hour of a 4 hour flight.Some people hate their fellow man. Some people just want to watch the world burn.  Delta's use of this particular Airbus design allows the worst among us to completely ruin the flight experience of 30 of their fellow passengers with nothing but the stink of their bowels.  You may think I'm overreacting... but I tell you... I literally just experienced the nightmare you are already envisioning. Not 30 minutes into the flight, some traveling fiend with a belly full of what could only be hell itself, absolutely destroyed that humble lavatory...  as the door swung open onto the sealed, pressurized cabin of travelers trapped at standard cruising altitude, the stench could only be described as terror inducing... it literally roused me from an early flight slumber and dragged me into the hell which would be my companion for the rest of the flight...  It would not matter if my tray table was up, or If my seat was in the upright position... I was doomed.  The smell Harassed at least five rows of passengers... While the closest unfortunate bystander had watering eyes and had to fight the urge to use the conveniently located vomit bags in the seat back in front of them.  In short, it was a a single serving package of punishment for those who failed to pay for preferred seating.I write this review having survived the experience.... sitting far enough away from the splash zone of this exhibition of nature and technology run amok, to implore Delta airlines to think about the safety and serenity of their passengers when choosing a design for an airplane.  There are monsters among us who care nothing for their fellow passengers... and one can only hope that the company upon which we place so much collective trust would protect us from those who would seek to harm us."
Date of travel: December 2019,30,"Suitable, not special","Typically I fly Southwest domestically however recently have found that Delta economy on some routes is comparable or better, so I opted to give them a try. The boarding process seems poorly thought out to me, I think they could do it more efficiently, but it wasn't bad. Service on the plane was decent, riding in economy you don't expect a lot but it was a bit below the level of service you could expect on Southwest. Overall it was an OK flight experience - nothing really to turn me off of flying Delta, but also nothing to motivate me to choose them over another carrier. I'd fly them again if their fare was the cheapest. Wouldn't pay extra money to fly with them though - since Southwest has no change or cancellation fees it's almost always a better option."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Cruise,Flew Delta to Florida to get on a cruise ship. Staff were friendly. Safe flight (uneventful) Used an online travel agent to book flight and cruise lines.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Delta flights are awesome!,"Love flying Delta, we had a late flight, with that being said in the peak of sick season, they allowed everyone to move after seats were determined. So I in return did not have to sit next to the person that was coughing all over the place! Thank you delta for taking our health in consideration! Will definitely be flying more with your airlines! Plus the wifi!"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Organized and Efficient Delta,"Delta has a wonderful phone app that works very well from checking in, to getting notifications for flights boarding, etc.  It works seamlessly.  Another shout out to Delta, this was a rebooked flight from one that was to have occurred in September and due to Hurricanes approaching Florida, Delta waived all change fees etc.  When available, Delta is for sure my go to airline.  It still offers service."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Delta,"Easy check in, flight at origin on time, connecting flight delayed a little, good service. A class above United and American. Recommend Delta and will use again."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,On time and friendly staff,The flight left on time with great service on board. The business class offered fully flat beds. We had one stop in Atlanta which was also on time when headed to Palm Springs. Delta offers a lounge with their business class service which was also quite convenient. Will fly delta again.
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Delta flight 56 slc to ams,"I love Delta and everything about them.  The 9 hour flight screwed up my back for days however. The last few hours I just couldn't get comfortable.  Not big - I'm 5'7"" and slender. Otherwise it was a smooth flight with great flight attendants."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Best flight in a long time,"Best flight-boarded on time, good service, arrived early.  No delays, that is my complaint about American. Pleasant flight attendants.  I had a TV screen on my first flight, not on the return, which was a little disappointing."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,smooth pleasent ride,I do not care for flying.  This flight was smooth and pleasent. -   The inflight movies are such a nice way to pass the time.  Cabin crew was professional.  Only setback was on return flight my bag was to big to go in overhead bin so I was told to check it.  I was not charged an additional fee to check the baggage.
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Spokane to Boston,"We flew from Spokane to Salt Lake and then on to Boston. Both flights arrived 20 minutes ahead of schedule.Although I don't appreciate Delta's new policy that choosing a seat requires extra payment, I do appreciate timely departure and arrival.Free movies on the second flight helped to pass the time."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Good Flight to Puerto Vallarta,"Seats were comfortable, service was friendly and good.  Easy on and off.  My only complaint is people abusing the system.  Delta pre-boarded ""people who need extra time"".  The line was long and was 80% people over 65 who were walking and moving just fine and top of that all pulling and carrying baggage.  They just wanted on the plane first.  Three people who were in line actually moved very slow or were using canes or other walking devices.  They deserved to be in this line. This abuse needs to be corrected just like people abusing the pet policy.  I am over 65 so not just complaining about old people."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,The best service ever!,"I had a roundup flight to Montgomery for business,my flight was executed with no hitches. My flight home was delayed, but I was sent a text hours in advance. Once in the air, my flight was excellent, the pilot moved us above the turbulence and we actually made up 20 mins due to winds. Definitely one of,if not the smoothest landing I've ever had.  I look forward to flying with them again soon."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Loyal Delta Customer,This was a great flight.  We connected through LAX.  Everything ran on time.  Great crews on both flights.  No luggage issues.  Thanks Delta!
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Just great service,As always great customer service. They actually seem to enjoy their work. Always a smile and how are are you today! Excellent food and beverage. On time!!!
Date of travel: March 2020,30,"They try really hard, but...","I had three stops. The leg to Salt Lake was pretty uneventful. I had  5 hour layover in Salt Lake and was nabbed by people promoting the Delta American Express Card in the airport. They said I could use the members club if I signed up. The lounge was so full there was no place to sit, and they wanted $39 to enter. You would have to eat and drink a bunch to make that right.The got on my plane for the next leg, to LA. They were having bad weather there so we went into a holding pattern. After a bit the pilot came on and said we needed to go to Las Vegas to fuel up!!! Ok, so they held the flight to San Jose because there were several people on board making that connection. When we got off the flight in LA the pilot gave a little talk about being kind, and suggested we do a random act of kindness for a stranger!The plane to San Jose was so old, there was caulking all over the bathroom plugging cracks!!! Come on, that was not a cheep flight!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,SD to Vegas,"I flew from Madison, WI through MSP to Sioux Falls, SD then back to MSP and finally to Las Vegas, NV before returning to Madison. Flying Comfort Plus was well worth the upgrade!"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,If you can get thru Atlanta then youve got it made,"Delta is consistently a good carrier so long as you don't get stuck in or going thru Atlanta. Good service, nice folks and so long as there are no weather delays, it works for your everyday travel."
Date of travel: May 2019,50,Spain to Portugal,"Clean, flight attendants went out of their way to assist.Food okay.  Several attendants engaged in conversation with guest and gave they positive feedback to help enjoy your vacation"
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Best service for handicapped person,"My husband is handicapped and Delta was excellent in dealing with our needs. The only problem was the long time between flights in Minneapolis,3.5hours. Other than that no complaints"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,"GREAT SERVICE, COMPANY, EMPLOYEES, ETC","took a delta flight from atlanta to cancun with no issues.  the plane was full, so there wasn't much to do buy sir in your seat and be comfortable.   The flight attendants were helpful, responsive, and delivered the service we expected."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,"Madison, WI to San Diego, CA","As always, the cabin was clean and the flight attendants were very friendly. The in-flight entertainment and services were excellent."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,DELTA PUT US IN A SPECIAL CATEGORY SUCH THAT WE WERE IN SEATS RIGHT BEHIND FIRST CLASS AND THEY GAVE US  SPECIAL EAR PLU,On the way up to Boston we had a  143 MPH tail wind so we were going over 600 MPH.  Made the flight in two and a half hours.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Flight to Vegas,"As always, I had a great flight with Delta! No problems at all. Flight attendants were very nice and flight was smooth. I like when the captain makes announcements over the PA system. I always find it hard to understand them, because of the noise of the planes. I end up understanding most of what being said. Wish they could work out a better system when your 35,000 feet in the air.But all in all, from take off to landing it all went great! Thanks Delta 👏👏👏👏"
Date of travel: April 2019,50,Great Flight,Flight was great both ways. We left Boston on time and arrived in Orlando on time. Everyone was friendly.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Delta is our favorite airline of choice,"There was actually a time years ago that we had ""broken up"" with Delta.  There were too many issues and none were handled appropriately.  We forgave and forgot and started trying them out about 4 years ago.  They are now my preferred airline of choice and I find the service to be wonderful.  There's always a chance for delays when you travel but how issues are handled can make a world of difference.  We haven't experienced many issues with Delta but when we have, the communication has been wonderful."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Easy flight,"Such an easy flight using Delta from Atl to Grand Cayman as every seat has a screen. On the way down I watched  the movie, Judy and on the way back Parasite. It filled the time! Thank you Delta!"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Trip to Denver,Delta provided excellent service between MSP and DEN. The trip was on time and the crew was friendly and professional.
Date of travel: December 2019,20,Terrible connection experience,We left Boston on time. Landed in Atlanta late. Had to run(and tram) from the end of one terminal to the end of another. I had considered using wheelchair help as I am in my 70s and have serious back issues but thought our connection time was sufficient. One of our party ran to gate for connection and they could see me coming/limping down the concourse as fast as I could but the gate agent said he would give our sears to standby passengers if I were not at the gate in 15 seconds. I made it but barely and strained my back.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,SLC to MSN,"A perfect, uneventful flight!  I prefer non-stop flights when available and this one worked out great.  The flight attendants were accommodating and every aspect of the flight was uneventful, just the way I like it!"
Date of travel: July 2019,30,At least it was direct,These children sized seats were acceptable for minutes but became uncomfortable on a 4 1/2 hour flight. However it seems that delta is one of the few direct flights from Detroit to Seattle.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Delta arrives on time,"Take the morning flight because it is less crowded.The airplane itself was clean inside but leg room is very limited in economy.The Flight Attendants were excellent, friendly and cooperative.The flight was smooth and arrived on time.Baggage was off loaded quickly."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Delta is usually pretty good.,"These flights were good, on time, and they upgraded me to a better seat in Economy Premium, which was unexpected but very nice.  I think they might have done this because I was in the very last seat of the plane.  Maybe for weight and balance purposes?   Who knows, but it was appreciated, and I'm grateful.   The gates were far away on the layover in Atlanta, which was strange,  and I had to take the tram to a different terminal.  It was a very short layover and this doesn't make sense at all.  Just the way it works out I guess.  Oveall I got lucky with these flights."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Delta is my #1 choice in airlines.,"I've had good experiences flying Delta,although I've flown on other international airlines that were also very good. On the flight I am referencing, the flight attendants were exceptionally professional and friendly. Their actions made the flight an enjoyable experience!"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,first trip on the new Airbus 350,"On this flight, the new Premium Select Class is offered. Again a litle step upwards compared to Econamy and Economy Plus.  More leg space, improved seat, better meal service. Premium Select will be my target for future flights."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Miami Wedding,Everybody was great.  Great service and polite service.  Comfortable space.  On time boarding and efficient exiting.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Delta Delivers,"We took our 2 (under 3) kids to Orlando, Fl. Delta was quick and efficient from check in, app use, the flight, the service, the snacks and even the baggage. No issues at all, except a bathroom malfunction that led to everyone using hand sanitizer wipes. It could’ve been worse. They also had an Orlando airport assistant get my wife’s lost shoes before they pre-boarded the next flight. Amazing! The flight back was just as good, if not better!"
Date of travel: September 2019,10,No room and terrible food for a 9 hour flight,Delta has done the most to make the long flights the most uncomfortable  by adding seats and taking away leg room. Sitting cramped like a sardine  is not my view a a comfortable flight
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Upgrade to First Class didn’t hurt,"This was a very good flight.  Other than some weather related turbulence at first, it was smooth.  Service was very good.  Food was good.  Flight was on time."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Genesis Open,"Great flight, crew, food, and comfort. Flight was in time with no issues. Captain communicated well with the passengers and crew. Very pleasant trip."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Enjoyed our trip on Delta,"Delta did a good job on two recent international flights. One to Barcelona and one from Rome to the US. Although the seating was cramped in Economy, it was better than a recent Alitalia flight. But most of all, we found delightful flight attendants, reasonable food and beverage service and ticketing help. Although one flight was late and we missed a connection, they helped to find a solution. I'd go back to Delta in a heartbeat."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,International flights,Was treated like a Queen . Service impeccable and updated and notifications were prompt and very helpful
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Albuquerque,Flight was uneventful.  Weather factored in being significantly delayed on the return trip.  Flight attendants provided ample snacks and beverages.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Direct flight with no problems,"We upgraded to the premium economy as my husband is over 6 feet tall and it was worth it.  The cost of upgrading varies, but on this flight to Mexico City, it was only $40.  Everything was as expected.  Our baggage arrived, the flights were quiet and our seat equipment all worked."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Love to Fly Delta,"Our flight was delayed because of an electrical problem.  The pilot and the flight attendants kept us updated throughout the wait. Because it took longer than expected, we were allowed to disembark and sit comfortably at the gate,  They continued to update us and apologized profusely to us for the delay. We fly Delta most of the time and this is our first delay."
Date of travel: April 2019,50,Best Airline!,"I have only flown Delta for years, and will continue to only fly Delta! The service, experienced personnel is the reason I fly Delta. People say they pay more with Delta, but I say you get what you pay for!"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Delta to Aruba,"Leg room very tight. JetBlue has much more leg room. Check In is chaotic. Just by Class, not rows. Fare was better than JetBlue this time."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Great Flight & Staff,"Very nice seats & very clean, Delta has taken extra steps ! Attendants very friendly & attentive. Only one thing my screen in 38B did not work well touch screen was not user friendly! Needs to be checked out."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Trip to Europe,"The flights and all connections were on time or early, the staff at the terminals were all friendly and helpful and all flight attendants were exceptional"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Consistent high marks!,"I fly a lot for work and I can choose any airline but I always pick Delta Airlines. My coworkers complain about Southwest, American, and United either about the ""cattle call"" or grumpy employees. I'm sure Delta employees have their bad days too but they never reflect it to me with my numerous interactions. Delta is worth a few bucks more than Southwest and a great value compared to United and American. No other U.S. airline can beat Delta in my experience."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great Flight,"Even though it was a long flight, this airline has the whole process down which made the flight go fast!"
Date of travel: March 2020,20,Too pricey!,The whole flying experience is way overpriced and overrated! They pack everyone in as tightly as possible and charge whatever they feel like. And you can forget about a refund even if you can’t make your expensive flight! There are all these fees and other charges! How many bags do you have? Oh that’s an additional fee! What day and time do you want to fly? Oh you said last minute? Oh that’s going to be extra now that it’s a popular date!! I only fly as a last resort!
Date of travel: March 2020,50,I love Delta,"This company is one of the best I know, they usually are on time.I love the app and all information with it's very easy to be on right gate all the time.The people are very nice and helful (except Atlanta)."
Date of travel: October 2019,30,A long cramped flight,"This was a very long flight. On a good note we were given nice meals, snacks and drinks. Wine with dinner was nice. We also had free movies.  The not so good, we fly often and this was the most cramped seats we have ever encountered! We were actually told by flight attendants that if we drop something to ring a flight attendant to pick it up. There is no way anyone could bend over in the seat.  Coming home we flew air Canada ,much nicer!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Nice Flight,"Our flights were very good each way. We really enjoy Delta's back-of-the-eat video monitors to watch movies, TV shows, etc. Be sure to bring your ear buds. This certainly helps make the trip go by much faster. The crews were very good each direction. Delta is still providing free pop and snacks. The only complaint I have involves the McCarran Airport for signage to Uber/Lyft areas. Signage is horrible on where to catch these rides!"
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Delta is remaining one of my favorites but...,"I really like Delta. The plane seems well maintained. They have the service during the flight. They have good communication. However, be prepared to haves your hand bag checked suddenly instead of come inside the plane with it and you will discover it at the plane entrance. The last two flights I had, at the plane entrance I was informed the storages are completely full and I needed to check my hand bag. The last one was with 60 empty seats and what? All the storages full? The crew really don’t know how to handle with non-polite people that brings inside more than 2 item, put everything (personal item and bags) inside the storage instead of under their seats. The crew only stay looking as “I don’t know what to do” or “it’s not my problem” until the storages be full even with 60 empty seats. The crew instead of be at entrance saying “welcome. How are you?” They should be spread through the corridor helping people to use only the storages above their seats and guiding to put the personal item under the seat. If someone else is using more than this two places, this person should be have his hand bag checked to learn and not the people that are not even inside the plane. If I payed for a seat I should be able to put my hand bag above it and not other person. It’s totally non-respectful be asked at the plane entrance if I have batteries, jewelry, electronics in my hand bag because it needs suddenly to be checked because there is no more room for it. And if the answer is “yes, there are jewelry.”? Do I need to stop the entrance to open and reorganize my hand bag? Because people is not polite and don’t follow the rules and the crew does not know how to handle with it? These really makes me upset. The flight started and I hadn’t received my confirmation number of my checked hand bag, I could not know if it was really put inside. I received only after during the flight. This control of what people brings inside and where they storage should be better controlled by the crew."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Best Airline to Travel in my Opinon,"I always like flying delta, great selection of entertainment, professional agents, free wifi was plus and was able to text on whatsapp the entire trip."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Good trip with Delta,"All flights with Delta worked very well, plane crew worked really hard to make sure we were well taken care of during the flight. Was not overly implressed with Air China, i did not consider them a very good partner."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Always take travel insurance,"Here TO NO FAULT of Delta whatsoever, my arrival in Fort Lauderdale was delayed over two hours. It was a freaky wind storm where there were consistent winds well over 35 kn for several hours. Air traffic control at LaGuardia had to limit arrivals/departures to only one runway due to the extreme wind conditions. I was not connecting with anything in Fort Lauderdale to create a problem. If I was connecting with a transcontinental flight and I was over two hours late I could’ve easily missed a connection and possibly lost out on a vacation. A great example of why travel insurance is necessary on crucial vacation schedules."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Love Comfort +,Flight attendants went out of their way to help me find my airpods! Was lost in my seat but great attitudes by all involved- they didn’t seem to care i was the last person leaving the plane.  Great customer service.
Date of travel: April 2019,50,"Left on time, arrived on time. What more can one ask for","All I'm looking for in a flight is safety, on time departure and on time arrival. Ten, twenty, even 70 years ago, I would have looked for much more. Today, just get me their safely; that's all I ask."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Review of Delta Air Lines,We normally use Delta when flying from Oklahoma to Florida to board our cruises out of Florida.  Price is always important as it is the second largest expense item in our cruise budget.
Date of travel: August 2019,50,On the road again,"I fly back and forth from Quitó Ecuador to Wichita Kansas about once a year. I have flown on other airlines only to have them loose my luggage, miss connecting flights (of the same Airline) not to mention smaller seat sizes because they want to get more people into a their VW Bug (airplane) then everyone else. I know everyone has their own Opinions and Preferences regarding everything but I find, if enough people are willing to write an inelegant review on a restaurant, hotel or airline then it behooves me to take that into consideration. Delta has had a bad reputation in the past, of which they earned, but as of late they are back doing business quite professionally, on time and with as few problems as possible."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Fly Delta or don't fly,"Delta is the best airline to fly to Mexico.  On time, good service, friendly staff.  But now is not the time to fly!!!"
Date of travel: January 2020,40,air conditioning broken,"We were loaded on the small aircraft and it was very hot outside and hotter inside the plane.  The flight attendant was called in and was late.  The air conditioner motor that is in the tail of the plane was inoperable and we had engine problems as well.  The Pilot came on and apologized for everything that was happening, but we were sweating so bad, people were fanning themselves.  They should have at least offered water.  It was about 45 minutes of sitting and sweating.  Terrible!"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,They made it right,"After a 7 day cruise we were ready to get home we had been at the airport for 3 hours already when our flight encountered a mechanicalFailure the plane was for 200+ people and not in the US states, so after much struggle from Delta to get us to Atlanta they had to fly another plane large enough to us 3 more hours and a new crew after many hours we finally made it to Atlanta at 4:30am Delta gave us both 16,500 air miles plus reimbursed us for food! Not ideal travel situation but they worked hard to make it right!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Delta Columbus to Key West,"We have flown Delta through Atlanta to Key West in February for the past 11 years. Only twice did we have delays that caused stand by issues due to weather. That is the risk you take that time of year! Part of the adventure. We are skymiles people and have the American Express Delta credit card which allows access to the Delta Sky Clubs. This has made the Atlanta layovers very enjoyable for sure!  Complimentary food and beverage, comfortable seating, wifi, etc. Pretty much exclusive Delta customers. Even used them to fly to Australia. Same wonderful experience."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,It was great and convenient.,It was great from check-in and boarding. There was 2nd line right after Delta One. The service inflight was very much the same as Delta One.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,It's tough to be good during the holidays,"With the hustle and bustle of the holidays, it can be difficult to provide good service - but Delta - both on the ground and in the air - provided very good service.  Only complaint was that the gate was far, far, far, far away from check in, but counter agent 'warned' me and called for a 'ride' to ease my concerns.  On both legs of the trip - it seemed I was destined to visit extreme ends of the airport."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,ON time flights with Delta,The flight was on time. The food was excellent. On load and off load were rapid and there were no issues with the bags which included skis.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,I love Delta for all my travel,I love flying Delta because the people are all really nice and I don't ever really have problems with them. The only issue I had was my flight from Raleigh to Newark and really it's a First World Problem. The airplane is older so it does not have monitors and the seats feel old and worn. Hopefully this plane will be switched out soon with one of the recent purchases .
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Great Flight Sydney to LAX,This was the first time I flew Delta between LAX and Sydney and it was great. I usually fly their partner Virgin Australia. I changed my return flight and VA was full so I went with Delta. The staff was attentive and food better than VA. I was upgraded to Delta Comfort so had a bit more space than economy however the plane was not full so plenty of people in economy were stretched out sleeping across 3 seats. One of my pet peeves is how gross the bathroom gets on a long flight. This flight had the cleanest restroom I have ever seen on a flight. Obviously the crew tidied up periodically. Even cleaner than my final leg home to NY on another flight that was only 5 hours. I hope to return to beautiful Australia again and when I do it is very likely that I will fly Delta.
Date of travel: July 2019,40,Atl to London,We sat in the front row of coach in a Premium Economy seat. I strongly urge anyone on long flights to spend the extra money. well worth it.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Great New Movies/ Comfort Only,"Non Stop , on time, smooth Flying and we only fly Comfort Class. Otherwise crowed.We are building points for a big trip.

Date of travel: March 2020,50,"On time, excellent service and comfortable","I couldn't have been happier with the service, comfort and prepared meal. The flight attendants were attentive and friendly. Great flight."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,How to handle a breakdown of airplane,Got to Airport in San Jose and Delta had to cancel the flight due to a mechanical issue.  Gave everyone a Hotel Room and Vouchers for Dinner and arranged alternate transportation for the next day.  In my case they only needed to drive me back to my condo and pick me up the next day.  They made a difficult process very east.
Date of travel: April 2019,50,Such a great airline!,"I've always used Delta Airlines for all my travels and it never disappoints! The staff is super friendly, very smooth flying and never any technical or other issues. Definitely recommend flying Delta!"
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Delta needs to clean their planes,"Round trip from Atlanta to Cleveland with my brother.  His fold down tray had stains and food all over it.  On the way back, napkins and other trash in the seat pockets in front of us.  Is this day of fear with Covid-19, one would think they would attempt to make the plane as clean as possible."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Air travel,"Our RT flight was a pleasure. The flight crew were professional, it was on time, the landings were smooth and our baggage arrived safely. We will fly Delta whenever we can and the price is right."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,No wait!,"Delta is always on time if not early.  Everyone was boarded efficiently and quickly, but before that the request to check baggage was made well in advance.  We left 30 minutes early and arrived at Salt Lake City 45 minutes earlier than scheduled!"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Best airlines,"First time ever flying Delta Airlines.Class above for Price, cleanliness, organization, comfort. I was pleasantly surprised how much above other airlines I have used.  Definitely will use them in future whenever possible.  Thank you Drlta for being above the rest and making my trip so easy."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Good Customer service,"Whether you fly first class or coach Delta has good customer service while flying. A large selection of movies, series, tv shows,  games available to everyone with headphones free or in coach $2 if you need to purchase headphones. Descent food and snack selection.I much prefer Delta over United, I will choose them everytine."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,We had a great flight,The flight was on time both departures and on arrivals.  The staff was friendly and the plane was comfortable. There was sufficient overhead storage for our carry on luggage. Our plane also  had one of the better TV/Music systems compared to other airlines- loved that the volume controls and headphone jacks were near the tv screen instead of on the armrest.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great service,The flight left on time and arrived early.  The flight attendants provided great service and we very friendly.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Delta to and from,Great to and from on Delta Air Lines. Great service and attention to detail. I always choose delta as they were just rated #1 airline of the year.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Use Delta all the time,Delta Airlines is the way to go. Like their organized boarding system.  Most of our trips are booked at Delta. Flights are always on time. Airport Personnel and flight attendants are  kind and helpful.  Airplane and Terminal   are clean.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Best Service I have had in a Long Time,"I was very pleased with my two flights to Yeager Airport. First of all, in Houston check-in and baggage check is so much better than the other airline choices. Delta does use a Kiosk for check-in but their App makes the Kiosk unnecessary. The baggage check was handled at the counter by Delta not like the other Airlines who make you print your own baggage tags, place the labels on by yourself and then haul them to another location to check them in. One smooth procedure to check-in and check bags with Delta. Both of my flights were not only on time but ahead of schedule! The service on the plane is a better experience than the other airlines. Also, Delta's hub is Atlanta. The other choices have you going through Chicago, which is horrible or Charlotte, NC with short connection times. Atlanta airport does a great job of moving you from one terminal to the next via the Train Plane. Delta has connection times that allow you to make your connection and usually grab a quick sandwich between flights. I would rather have an hour and half between flights than a quick 25-30 minutes to de-plane, change terminals (usually a long distance) and board the next flight.The service on-board the plane was very good and professional. I will have to return to WV soon and have already decided to fly on DELTA.I highly recommend Delta and will fly with them in the future."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Managed an emergency well,A sick passenger required an emergency landing in San Antonio but the crew managed the whole situation pretty well
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Best service ever.,"Last Tuesday 3/3/20 I returned to the USA from Australia. I have to say that the African American flight attendant I had was the best. Customer service was 10/10. From take off to landing, she smiled, she gave eye contact, she made conversation with passengers, she showed concern for the sick passenger in front of me. I didn’t get her name but I was absolutely impressed with her and needed to share it.  I hope Delta recognizes her for her hard work in keeping the passengers safe and comfortable. She even thanked us for flying with “DELTA” as she handed out chocolates. I hope she’s on my next flight back to Australia next month."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Nice short hop over.  Atlanta to North Eleluthra Bahamas,"A very nice little flight.  There is more information to share about the ELH airport than the actual flight.  Delta departure is super easy, and they do use facial recognition software so be ready for that.  I think it helps with the return back to US.  It is a fairly quick flight, and leaves on time.  We checked in at the domestic terminal, and then took the lower sub train to the international terminal.At landing, it is a small building that hold the incoming and the outgoing together with the same staff checking all persons.  Everyone is friendly and doing their best to get you on your vacation quickly.On the return be sure to arrive back two hours early to allow for the  process, they need it, and they will turn you away if you are late.  good luck and have fun@nickellfamiyltravel"
Date of travel: February 2020,20,old plane uncomfortable seats,"I use this flight a lot to and from Atlanta/Toronto. The plane is ancient,seats uncomfortable. It is an MD-88. We left the gate then were told  there was some maintenance issue. This took  over an hour to get cleared for takeoff. Interesting that instead of delaying the flight (ie we could have waited in the terminal), we got on the plane 'assuming' it was on time. Then we had to de-ice in Atlanta.The pilot was able to make up more than 15 minutes on our flight.Staff polite etc. they are always fine. Given 1 beverage 3.5 hrs. Seats are really terrible. My back was sore for days after. Usually this flight is ok but the plane is crappy and should be out of service. No entertainment, wifi failed etc."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Super nice,This previous dusty US airline has really cleaned up nicely and is now provide super service and comfort
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Return flight to NYC from WPB: uneventful and that's the way I like it!,"We enjoyed efficient service, on time arrival (aided by headwinds) and a totally uneventful flight. The staff were professional and efficient. As long as I arrive in one piece I am happy."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,The Only Way To Fly!,"Hands down Delta Air Lines is the best airlines!  Quality, professional flight staff, early arrivals and the pilots and dispatch provide the best service in the skies!  I know that when I chose Delta, I've chosen well!!!"
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Delta Airlines is awful,"Worst customer service EVER!! They would rather make no money on an upgrade on seats then taking a minimal fee for AMEX Delta Sky Miles members willingness to pay a minimal fee. We were told the CFO of Delta would rather take nothing and leave seats empty then take a minimal upgrade fee from a Delta Comfort Sky Miles customer. Additionally the woman at gate B38 at JFK around 6:50 PM on Sunday 3/8/2020 said the reason Delta is #1 is because of this policy made by the CFO.  Interesting fact, Delta is not #1 but #56, makes sense now.I’m canceling my all three of my AMEX cards as soon as we land and NEVER flying Delta again. I will be having my company revise our travel policy to exclude Delta from all travel."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Italy to JFK,"We recently flew from Italy to JFK. We upgraded our seats for more leg room since it was a 9 1/2 hour flight. They really have everything set for passengers. Cocktails, dinner, nap, breakfast and your own personal tv to watch a variety of movies, shows, play games etc. The flight was quicker then I expected."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,A consistently good experience,"I'm likely a bit biased given that I travel on Delta frequently for business, so I do have the opportunity of several free upgrades, but that aside, since I also fly on multiple  other airlines from time to time I definitelyI find Delta's  overall reliability and quality of  service to exceed each one of the other main airlines time and again."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Delta is the best!,"Always on time and if they aren't, it doesn't matter.  A delayed flight for aircraft maintenance is more important than anything to me.  Prompt, professional, the best, in my opinion.  Now, if they would just make their frequent flyer mile redemption a bit more affordable I would be happy.  Other credit card airline redemption is much less than Delta."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,"Good flight, microscopic bathrooms","Premium economy on Delta is always a pretty pleasant experience.  Friendly crew, good service on board, and the airplane was fairly clean.  The one BIG issue we have with Delta is that they've shrunk the bathrooms in coach almost to the point of extinction.  Of course, they did this to provide more room for more seats and, therefore, more revenue.  I am 6' 1"" at 220 lbs and I felt like I was being smushed into a UPS shipping box."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Great service,"Another great surprise, such lovely people, the crew were just great, service overall perfect.  Good snack service and beverages and were always coming round with  water. In flight had good programme but I personally did not watch.  The bathrooms were serviced regularly and very clean."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,nice flight to brunswick ga.,"very nice flight to Atlanta, spending time at delta sky miles very nice, makes flying more enjoyable, free drinks and snacks. nice flight into brunswick, rented car at airport for drive to st. siamons  island!"
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Great Flight,"Crew was very nice, helpful and polite. Complimentary snacks and beverage were great. Would definitely fly with them again."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Way to Go,Flights to and from were all good. Flight attendants were pleasant and helpful. First class attendant made sure passengers were well attended to. Only concern was the departing the plane was slow and a bit cumbersome.
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Ok flight on old equipment,"Flight was fine and landed a few minutes early. Planes were on the old side, MD80, MD90, and newer  Boeing B717.Planes had seating 2 seats one side, 3 seats other side."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,winter getaway,The flight left on time and arrived early into New Orleans. Fight was full but had great service from flight attendants. They came around with drinks and a snack. Then they came around again with coffee and water.
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Second portion of our flight home in New York from winter vacation in Florida,Very nice flight from Charlotte North Carolina on our way home from winter vacation in Florida. Passengers were loaded very nicely and plane was very clean. Flight attendants were very professional and flight was very good. Will definitely go back and fly Delta Airlines again.
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Late departure & No entertainment system,"When one has a favorite airline.....one always likes to fly Delta! Our flight to Atlanta was delayed as PDX had only one de iced truck, they’re second de iced truck was broken down. So our plane had to wait it’s turn , which caused an hour delay . Once we were able to be airborne, the entertainment systems did not work the entire 5 hour flight.....big bummer as Delta has fabulous entertainment on board.our pilot did try to make up the lost time, which was very nice."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Inexcusably Late Departure,"Delta has always been a favorite airline of mine. However this flight  was delayed because the cleaning crew had not cleaned the aircraft! Always upon deplaning, the cleaning crew is on board working efficiently to tidy the plane. We were delayed by one hour because the plane had not been cleaned! The waiting area was overflowing with passengers waiting to board . This is totally in excusable.  Every passengers plans were ruined by this lack of this common procedure being completed  in a timely manner."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Delta whenever I can from now on,"Three flights in one day - Vancouver to Seattle - left late but the pilot drove it like he stole it - made up half the lost time.  This made for a tight connection but we made it to the next one - Seattle to Atlanta on a B767 - wow!  The individual travel pods make all the difference in the world.  They call it Delta One and it is wonderful.  This is the only way to fly.  Dedicated flight crew, actual hot meals, drinks to order, and very personable FA's.  The three FA's  were always on top of your needs and were willing to go out of their way to ensure you were informed, comfortable, and enjoying the flight.The next leg from Atlanta to Fort Lauderdale on a B757 was pretty good but a little less over the top than Delta One service.  The crew on this flight were humorous and made the two hour flight feel very short.  Just snacks  and drinks but with the same attentive service on all Delta flights so far."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Delta flight on winter vacation in Florida,Very nice experience. Airport was very clean and wait line was not bad. Flight attendants were very professional and flight was very good. Will definitely use Delta again.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Very nice flight on Delta airlines,"I took a flight from Los Angeles (LAX) to New York (JFK) with Delta Airlines premium economy class.At LAX entire Terminal 2 was given to Delta Airlines.It was very crowded and the gates at the very end are so cramped and noisy.Delta flies Boing 767-300 planes from Lax to NYC.This plane was 2 aisled so called wide body jet but actually it was really narrow and very very old.The seats are comfortable and lots of leg room at Premium Economy. Seating is 2-3-2 configured but economy is the same with less leg room.Flight attendants are very kind and smiling all the time.My shocking discovery is their fast and efficient inflight services.1st one is hot and cold beverages with your choice of delicious cold pastrami sandwich and fruit and cheese plate. Sandwich come with grapes and small square of dark chocolate.2 nd service is just snack tray. Your choices are cookies chips, popcorn or fresh fruits. Impressive.3rd service is beverages and your choice of snacks.For a big surprise all food and beverage service announcements were done by the captain pilot. Flight was arrived 1/2 an hour early. Original arrival was 902 pm but arrived at 820 pm. Impressive again.I recommend Delta from LAX to JFK to everyone."
Date of travel: May 2019,40,I always try to fly Delta!,"A trip to Hawaii was most enjoyable and the ride was great. A bit long, but well worth the effort. The crew was very nice and helpful."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great airline and flight,Comfy with more leg room than expected.  Flight delayed returning to Atlanta but pilot made up most of the time.
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Avoid First Exit Row Seats,"sat in exit row seats 18d and the video sucks and flight crew can run the cart into your seat, will avoid those seats in future"
Date of travel: March 2020,10,Lost my luggage- terrible customer care-they did not care,"Check-in/Security - Very quick- only 2 people in front of me- airport fairly quiet-had to go through a security check- they checked what countries I had visited in the last few weeks  because of the Coronavirus. Timings- Left on time- landed on timeComfort - Fine- the legroom was OK and the seats recline just about the minimum acceptable amount to allow you to sleep without your head falling forward !Food -Not Great -I had pre ordered the Vegetarian options- however the quality was not good Entertainment  -A good range of movies Etc- although it broke down mid flight and they had to turn it off for 30 mins-Crew -Very friendly and helpfulPassport Control -Quick and easy-Baggage Reclaim - A Nightmare- they lost my luggage. They showed NO interest, were of no help and demonstrated terrible customer care."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Excellent!,"Best airline for service, flight attendants, city pairs, etc. Had a flight interruption due to Corona and they assisted. FYI other airlines like AMERICAN did not. Will not make the ""AMERICAN AIRLINES MISTAKE"" again."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,"Food on the first leg,great. second, not so great",Food and service from Rome to NY was excellent. From NY to LAX not so much.Value was good. I think the plane on the 2nd leg could have been a little cleaner but overall OK.
Date of travel: January 2020,40,The flights were on time.,"I flew with a friend.  She had a Delta American Express card, so we didn't have to pay for our luggage.  That was a plus.  The flights were on time.  They were full of course.  The service was good."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Excellent service,On our recent trip to Thailand we flew Delta airlines. I have never flown with them on an international flight before. I highly recommend them. They have a great selection of inflight entertainment (428 movies to choose from). They have a great In flight menu to choose your meals from too. Very professional in flight crew as well. Delta is going to be my new go to for international flights.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Delta for easy travel,"The airport terminal was easy to navigate, offered free live entertainment (piano), a delightful artistic fountain and had an excellent selection of restaurants and shops. Oh, and most importantly, the restrooms were clean."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Bathroom closets,"We like Delta because we find they leave and arrive on time. However, their bathrooms are broom closet size. They do not sanitize their planes (my tray was dirty). And the MOST annoying thing on airlines is when they load the plane front to back. That may have been fine when planes were a decent size. But now the aisles are barely big enough to walk down so people get slapped with bags as passengers go past them. It would make far more sense for airlines to load planes from the back to the front."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Commuter Flight,"I stopped flying Delta in 2015 when it was increasingly challenging to fly on a less than desirable airline due to delays and baggage losses. I resumed by experience with Delta in 2019 when I needed to get to another location quickly and Delta was the only airline that could give me a straight flight. I found the staff more attentive and professional and the planes better maintained. Most recently, I flew on a commuter flight and found it uneventful with a team of wonderful professionals. Thanks Delta for your improved service."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great Service and Comfortable Flight,"We flew Delta back to the US from Paris (one of four segments on a flight that originated in Cape Town, SA.  We found the Delta/Air France Terminal at CDG to be very pleasant and easy to manipulate.  Our flight, while delayed about 30 minutes for a minor mechanical issue, was very good overall.  The Purser and Flight Attendants were excellent and provided great service.  We were concerned about the short connection time we would have in Detroit for an onward flight but were assured that we would have no problems and that was indeed the case.  Clearing immigration and customs using Global Entry was the easiest I have ever experienced and we made it from the arrival gate to our departure gate at the other end of the Detroit terminal in under 30 minutes.  Overall, it was a great flight!"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Our first choice for flying.,We always fly Delta. Always have a good experience. Service is beat. Flight attendants are always pleasant.
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Damaged Luggage,"I have flown with Delta as my airline of choice for most of my travel for the last 10 years.  The service is generally quite good.  On this particular trip from Maui to Detroit, we had a layover in Salt Lake City.  At the time we booked, we had a bit over an hour between flights.  Subsequently, Delta changed the flight times and we were forced to change to a new flight with a 4 hour layover - Not Fun!  Furthermore, when we got home, I noticed that one of the suitcases was broken plus the contents inside were wet - most likely, the luggage was left out in the rain in Salt Lake City.  When I contacted Delta, they said that I didn't report the incident within the 24 hour time period and they will not take any responsibility for any damage.  Even a small token of responsibility would have satisfied me.  However, I will be glad to replace my luggage at my own expense but I will also replace my airline of choice for future flights.  Sorry Delta - this is not the service level I expected!!!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Winter Getaway,We had a layover in Atlanta on the way there and on Minneapolis on the way back.  It was a very good flight both ways with no delays!
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Delta Airlines,"Most staff we encountered were great!!! Check ins were fast and staff was very pleasant.  The problems are the women who have to search people ie ms Walters had horrible attitude, no home training and almost knocked me over.  Had a back brace on with letter from dr, she called it a waist trainer, wowwww, she tried to act like she didn't when I called her out, smh.  Other than that great experience with everyone else, be careful though, you can wind up spinning a lot of money on those layovers."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"every effort for being on time, courteous, best web site for travel","Trip was smooth sailing, outstanding service, flight attendants very attentive, and importantly..on time. I have traveled with Delta airlines for a long time. This airline appears to be very hard working with ""getting it right"" including their new snappy uniforms! I have also noticed that speaking over the intercom has improved with simple, necessary, and straight forward language. I applaud Delta for achieving a high level of performance."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Completely different experiences on outward journey to return,"We traveled to New York for school half term. The cabin crew on the way there were superb, really friendly and helpful. Before travelling home I had developed cellulitis, I spoke at the airport to various staff to ask if it was possible to be either seated where I could lie down or they could accommodate me to have my leg raised. The gate staff did offer me another seat but it was opposite the toilet which meant that my leg would’ve got banged if I’d had it in the gangway. I spoke to the cabin crew and the Purser and to be honest they couldn’t have cared less, I explained that if I could have my leg raised I may be able to avoid hospitalisation on my return to England. They literally did nothing, no support whatsoever and consequently when I landed in England we went straight to Bournemouth hospital where I remained on IV antibiotics for five days. I must stress that this might have happened regardless of the outcome of my request on the plane but I was highly disappointed with cabin crews response to my request. We were led to believe that Delta was a caring and considerate airline and that was our experience on the way there, however the journey home was totally the opposite of that. I have since tried to feed this back to Delta just so that they’re aware and have ended up with emails from risk management as if I’m trying to sue them which is totally and utterly ridiculous I just wanted to give them some feedback"
Date of travel: May 2019,50,My go-to airline,Terrific thunderstorms in Pittsburgh and the airport was closed. So we were late leaving. The ground crews and onboard crew were wonderful. They did everything possible to get us to Atlanta on time. They kept us updated often on our progress and connecting flights. Everyone I came in contact with at Delta was so friendly and helpful. If I have a choice of carriers I will choose Delta every time.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Above and beyond,"I just saw a Delta employee sprint through the terminal in Houston to search for an elderly lady who was about to miss her flight, while yelling, ""Just give me two minutes!"" The passenger boarded just in time! I'm not even flying Delta today, but next time I will."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Always have great service!,"I fly 4-5 times a year and I haven't had a bad experience in a really long time. No mechanical delays, cancellations. Great employees everywhere I go!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Vegas thru LA,"I didn't want to fly thru LAX, but it was the fastest route.  The trip down was good, and although we had to do a terminal transfer by shuttle bus, made the flight in plenty of time.  The way back I was still on a cane and Delta agent opened the special needs line for me.  I took it as a sign, and received an escort to the gate.  The gentleman who took me was wonderful.  Plane was running a little behind pulling away, but the pilot made up the lost time and we arrived early.  Great because we had a tight interim period.  Rebecca met our plane, got me to a bathroom, on the shuttle first that was there and made the gate quickly.  I was able to board on time and within minutes of arrival.  She definitely got the job done.  I love flying Delta, service excellence, safe planes, great pilots and occasionally, upgrades, two on this trip to First Class."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Adult getaway,"Although we were in the cheap seats, we had a good flight with great service. Left a little late, but arrived on time."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Highly recommended,"I Highly recommend it, the best company, excellent in customer service. Booked flight through FriendzTravel , thought I had purchase full cancellation insurance, only to find out it was only valid for 24-hour cancellation. FriendzTravel told me I had to email customer service and that there would be a $50 off the top fee to cancel the seats and the rest of the refund would have to be reviewed before credit could be issued. The flight was with Delta who had charged me for the tickets. So I called Delta and explained the medical reason for having to cancel and in just over a week, Delta gave me a full refund. FriendzTravel made my work easy. I recommend to book tickets through Friendztravel.com or call 1-844-382-5066. but of course, I must Thank Delta! I will now be reading the fine print closer when paying for cancellation insurance with any flight company."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Good flight,Airport is small and easily accessible.  TSA line was short and no problem.  Airline took off on time and went to Atlanta   layover was couple hours which can be expected for limited connections to Wichita KS
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great Service From Both The Flight Attendants and Ground Crew !,"I had a great experience with Delta Airlines , from the friendly and extremely helpful ground crew to the flight attendants . I had been totally messed up by my previous flight 'KENYA AIRWAYS, but Delta Guys really helped me out to the max and ensured that I arrived my destination happy ! The food aboard delta was also great , lots of refreshments !! Thanks guys ! You turned my previous Kenya Airways gloomy and dark travel into a bright Delta Experience !!Will fly with this airline over and over again without a flinch .!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Excellent service happy crew,"Flight was on time. A very happy crew who could not do enough and all done with a smile. Food was excellent. Not too keen on the pizza but that is personal taste. In all a pleasant experience,"
Date of travel: April 2019,20,Don’t bother with delta,Was booked on another flight with a different airline ; anyway we ended up on delta as they put a couple of different airlines all on to the delta flight ; I wasn’t impressed with this airline at all ; would of preferred the airline I booked with : only godsend was that our flight was late at night so I did sleep a fair bit of the flight : I think delta seemed like a big budget airline and would probably be alright for a short flight but not international flights
Date of travel: March 2020,50,"Great flight, great food, great crew","As always, Delta First Class did not disappoint!  One of the most friendly crews I have had!  Chicken Salad was fresh and great tasting, the red wine excellent."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Vacation,Multiple flights with delta for our vacation! Travelled with 2 young kids. They airline and employees were helpful and patient! Awesome ppl! Will def fly with them again!
Date of travel: January 2020,30,trip to Costa Rica,Flights were fine. If you buy basic tickets you do not get to pick where you sit on the plane. If you are traveling with someone you may not be sitting together.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Flying,This was a nice comfy flight with on board free entertainment. Love their cookies with beverages. The only problem is Deltas terminal seems so far away at large airports. You walk a long way to get to where your going.
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Talk About cramped,The plane while it was big looking on the outside sure packed in alot of passengers. The seats were very close together and tight. Felt like we was packed in like sardines.  Made my first flying experience almost my last.  Plane was very hot and like I said no leg room. If I go again it will be first class but that is basically just a bigger seat by a bit not real big. Didn't see anything classy about it except lil bigger seating and got to set in the front.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Wonderful experience,I was able to be in Premium class for a 11 hour flight to Korea out of Seattle  and then Delta One on the return 9. 5 hour return to Seattle both on an A 330 aircraft. The service and flight attendants were wonderful. The food was exceptional in both Delta one and the Coach.   There was plenty of room for my legs in Premium and of course over the top in the Delta One Suites.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Quality service,"I was very happy with my round trip service. The flights were on time, the service was great and I will fly delta as much as possible."
Date of travel: October 2019,10,What a difference three decades make!,"Wow! I used to think taking Delta Airlines was a privilege when I traveled home from college at Christmas or at the end of the school year. They always offered superb customer service, and I never once landed later than expected. Granted this was all 30 years ago and between 1988 to 1992. When I last flew on Delta Airlines for a business trip in October 2019, I felt more like I was on the equivalent of a Greyhound Bus.  Both legs of my departing flight were more than an hour late.  The first leg of my return flight out of Jacksonville was also an hour late due to a weather delay  The one time I needed my return flight to be detained because my transfer was late getting to the gate, that was the only time my connection left on time, meaning I missed my flight. Fortunately, by the grace of God and two helpful Delta gate employees, I was placed on another flight two hours later and did not suffer any additional costs. My days of considering Delta Airlines one of the premiere and upscale airlines are long gone. I am not sure if I will ever choose Delta as my first choice for travel again."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Fantastic airline,"Thoroughly enjoyed my flight to New York. First long haul flight, i was a bit anxious but they make you feel welcome from the start. As soon as the flight took off you get a welcome cocktail (if over 21) then you get a hot cloth to refresh. You get a pillow and a blanket, free earphones along with a sleep mask and earplugs. For dinner its a starter, main, side of bread roll and pudding. You can order free snacks and drinks all through the flight. After dinner the lights dim and its relax time.  Theres a wide choice of movies or tv series to watch on your own tv. Then after a few more hrs the lights go on, you get another hot cloth to refresh and you get a lighter snack and pudding again. Brilliant airline. Definitely recommend."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,First class service for economy price!,Just couldn’t fault the service from wonderful Delta crew when flying to Orlando this Feb. The personnel were patient and polite throughout the flight. Wouldn’t think twice about flying Delta on long haul flights- true professionals.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,It's their people,"If I could drive to Europe I'd go twice a year. Flying is what it is but Delta does everything it can to make it as nice as possible regardless of your status or cabin. The kindness and professionalism I've seen on this airline give me hope for the future of commerce and customer service in this world.Early for my flight, I was approached by an employee. I was at one of their workstations, the guy asked if I was going to ATL and advised I might want to get on the flight that was leaving now. Atlanta was getting some weather and everything would likely be more delayed as time went on. I took the advice.The bad news is my checked bag went on my scheduled flight, which was now 2hrs late, but here's the good news: The baggage services person I met with offered to grab my bag, call me when she had it and bring it to the curb so I didn't have to park!! – This would allow for the quick trip home that would now be impractical if I waited for the bag. I was headed out of town in the opposite direction of where I live. Traffic here is approaching LA badness and it would be the onset of rush hour by the time I got the suitcase. Everything worked out great because of Delta."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Ms.Nor Ros,"I had a great flight today,, good timing / flight Sched not that long flight ,only 2 hrs + lay over each time . 2x.Great seat, just lucky not to have anyone in the middle seat so got an extra space during the second segment of my flight  that took us 11 hours  plus.. flight 296  3/5/20. stomach is full the whole trip and lavatory is well kept.

Date of travel: February 2020,50,A refreshing journey,"My husband and I traveled from the Lehigh Valley (PA) to Sarasota on Friday, February 21, and returned on Monday evening, the 24th. We had a layover in Atlanta both times. All in, it was four flights on Delta. Every flight was very comfortable and relaxing. Every employee we encountered was friendly and courteous. On the flight from Atlanta to Allentown that Monday night, we flew through storms. The pilot somehow kept the flight very smooth. It was also reassuring to hear him come on the speaker from time to time to explain his request for keeping the seat belt signal on. I am not the most confident traveler, but every one of these flights helped my level of comfort and enjoyment of flying."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,First time would do again,"Many drive trips to HHI we didn’t have time to drive this time and decided to fly.  Everything was on time.  Flight to Atlanta connecting to HHI, just a great trip"
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Short haul flight - Refreshment on board :),This is my first time flying with Delta on a short haul flight.  I was delighted to learn that they are offering refreshment for free.  Also they provide pop soda for drinks. I was supposed to give a perfect score but did not because of their scheduling.  Toronto opens its sky at 6:30 am and the flight schedule was 6am.  So we have to wait for 30 mins before we were allowed to fly.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Long Haul Flight,"Delta One is by far the most enjoyable service class Delta offers.  On long-haul international flights, if you want to be well rested and relaxed upon your arrival, it's definitely worth the additional expense for Delta One."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,New Main Cabin Service,"This flight was on one of Delta's old 767's.  Leg room in premium economy was decent but the seats are uncomfortable and the video monitors were very tiny.  The crew was very efficient and most aspects of the new international service were good including the hot towel service, large bottle of water and food selection.  What I and my travel companion did not like was the overly sweet welcome drink that is mixed with sparkling wine.  Delta should dump this and return to a full beverage service before dinner."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Family,"Service and timeliness was AWESOME, baggage handling was fast and timely as well. All personnel connected to Delta were very responsive and helpful always with a smile willing to assist with any questions."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,"As usual, Delta was delayed and horrible customer service.","Absolutely awful customer service to top off delayed connecting flights and connecting flights scheduled way too closely together for Delta. I wasn't able to choose the connecting flights, BUT I was blamed for it by several customer service representatives along the way! It ate up a couple days on either side of our vacay. BOOOO. They have offered two $75 vouchers! HA! I'll never, ever, ever fly Delta again. I've filed a BBB complaint and will continue to file complaint after complaint until someone listens and remedies the situation. They shouldn't be allowed to conduct business this way."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great Flight ✈️,Omgosh!  I went for a memorial. I had to contact Delta two times for itinerary changes. Their customer service was fabulous. They made all my changes AND there was no extra fees!$!  Then we had a delay due to a mechanical issue and to my surprise there was no guessing or chatter about how long or anything. Why???  Delta let us all know what was going on every 10 minutes. We boarded and made up most the delay in the air. Great trip going and wonderful trip returning. I will be booking my flights with Delta and highly recommend everyone else does too.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,First time on Delta,"Having never flown Delta and not knowing exactly what to expect, we were pleasantly surprised to find out we were seated together. The plane wasn't full and we liked out seats. It was a bit turbulent for the first hour, so we missed out on a drink and snack. This was the weather's fault, so we were ok with it. The landing was a teeny bit bumpy, but was nothing real bad."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,UAL First Class,"Routine first class (food, service, leg room) etc. Was disappointed to learn that first class did not give access to the lounge. You had to pay to be a member. This cheapskate approach is different than most of the other airlines that we have flown ( British Air, ANA, Virgin Australia etc). It will definitely lead me to choose a different airline if there is one available to my destination."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Packed and small airplane,"The flight was full, but the airplane was small, and many carry on bags had to be checked in.  Otherwise, the rest of flight experience was just average with the small and oldish airplane."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,First Flight on Delta,"On November 5, 2019, I had the opportunity to fly on Delta Airlines for the first time. My original seat assignment was in the middle of the plane but I was upgraded closer to the front. This was a good expererience as it was my first time with the airline.I found the air hostesses to be professional and effecient in what they did and were helpful when called upon. The flight lasted for approximately one hour and was bumby for a signifcant amount of the time.Based on the experiences on the flight, I would travel with Delta Arlines again in the future."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Delta is a Favorite,Early departure. Early arrival and excellent service. So nice to have all your expectations met as planned!
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"On time, a bit crowded like other airlines, friendly","Every time we have flown Delta we have found everyone to be very friendly, accommodating, and genuinely caring.  The cabin was clean but the restrooms needed attention as the floors were dirty and smelly and one of the doors in front of the sink kept opening."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Round trip,"Flying out of Shreveport is s month, stress free experience, coupled with Delta- friendly service and great price for a round trip ticket. Delta is the only way I will fly."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Amazing flight attendant servive!,"Incredible service, and an early arrival. Lots of water walks and multiple drink runs. Many snack and food choices!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great Customer Service,Great customer service at the gate  (although MCO airport is insane!).  Nice new plane was great - nice to have a choice with snacks.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Perfect as usual,"Delta is my normal carrier because you know what to expect.  The flight was on time, we had no issues boarding and the flight landed 45 minutes earlier than scheduled.  The staff are always more than accommodating, and with children it is nice to have a little extra support"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Delta Flight Review,"Our flights were excellent for this trip! The staff was very pleasant and accommodating. The planes were all new planes and we were able to watch movies, listen to music, and track the flight on the tv screen. Staff handed out headphones to everyone that needed them."
Date of travel: January 2020,30,Aruba Flight,"We fly every January first class from Minneapolis, MN to Aruba.  We normally  gateway through Charlotte, Atlanta and Miami.  I found this non stop flight and booked at slightly higher prices than American Airlines.Non-stop first class flight from Minneapolis, MN to Aruba.  Cost was inline with other airlines.  Now same first class flights are not inline with other airlines.  Why Delta has now increased the flight by almost 100%.Original flight, on time, smooth and great.  Negative is no drink service until in the air. Then, we get to watch cabin attendants sit and talk while first class waits and waits and waits for first drink.Drink menu looked good but when you ask for scotch they were out.  First class service on this flight was not very good.  Food selections few and not very good."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Great flight and crew,Fabulous service and attention to detail by a great group of professionals.  It was actually a pleasure to be greeted by friendly folks at the gates with on time service.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,HERMAN,"Great Service,Great Airline! I've been with this airline, Since they were called ""NORTHWEST AIRLINES"" !!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Easy flight,"Easy flight, great service. Flight was direct Aruba from Atlanta. Flights were on time. All were full."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,"Newer airplanes, nicer employees","We've found that Delta aircraft and service have exceeded JetBlue and certainly all other American operated airlines. Their purchase, ticketing, terminals, boarding, and in-flight experiences are much better. I really enjoy their in-flight entertainment options.  Pricing is good especially if you buy as soon as prices drop on their website or if you monitor the ups and downs and can be flexible with dates/times of travel. ALWAYS buy on their site so that you can purchase upgrades. Check third party websites but buy on DELTA site."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Late takeoff,The original plane had issues so we were late departing. Paid for comfort seats I couldn’t use  my tray as the seat in front of me would move quickly up and down as the passenger shifted in their seat. Screen for watching movies was small as compared to the plane we took from Columbus to Atlanta.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Both flights were on time!,"Delta staff run a clean operation. I had to get a seat assignment for both flights and had no problem, The plane was clean, the staff pleasant and cordial. Altogether, the price of the flight and experience was great."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,"New plane, comfortable seats","It was a newer plane and full flight.  I had a window seat and was worried about the leg room but was pleasantly surprised that there was good space.  The food options were okay, nothing blew me away.  The sound system did have to be rebooted a couple times, but overall the quality was decent."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Impeccable,"First trans-Atlantic flight for me, had booked with Virgin but outward bound flight was with Delta. Impeccable experience from start to finish. Smart, helpful, friendly, courteous staff. Wonderful food with great choice, generous drinks, large entertainment choices. Cannot think of anything negative to say- will most definitely choose to fly with them again."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Off to Vegas,"This trip required a change of planes in Detroit.  Snow delayed everything in Rochester.  But we managed to get to Detroit in time to race to the connection.   Everything was going fine on the flight to Vegas until a passenger got quite ill and required a Dr., oxygen, and lots of flight crew attention.  Thankfully we all made it OK."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,A little let down,I don’t like how the seating arrangement was on this particular flight I set 10 rolls from my husband and we actually exchanged  our seats so other people could sit together.. so many people on this flight were sitting without their other .. and it took an hour for the flight attendants to hand out the ear pods ..
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Delta flight,"It was cool in Florida on our last day, so we decided to go to the airport early and possibly catch one of the earlier flights.  We were surprised that we were asked to pay $75 each to change our flight to fly earlier that day.  We decided to pay the fee and they were able to get us seat assignments close to where they were on our later flight and even got the two of us together.  Nice flight that boarded quickly and the pilot got us there 30 minutes early!"
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Worst flight in many years,"After a choppy weather-related delay into our intermediate Atlanta stopover, we found the flight into Hilton Head was delayed by 2 hours.  Fog had held the incoming flight on the ground.  On boarding, the pilot forewarned us the ride would be very rough, but the ground visibility was now 1 mile...    En route however the fog had rolled back into the airport.  The pilot took two landing passes but failed to find visuals each time - unsettling for passengers as the plane sprints back to altitude.  At midnight we diverted to Savannah and then had to be given taxis for 45 miles to our Hilton Head destination.    Airport there closed tight, of course.    We will NEVER try to fly into SC low country again in winter, as the day's moist heat and night's cool makes this airport all but unusable."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"Great Flights as always, by Delta","Delta is the best. Comfortable seats, free in flight movies and shows, nice attendants and free beverages and snacks."
Date of travel: March 2020,40,Delta Comfort + row 13,"This flight left on time and arrive a bit early.  The flight attendants are very kind and helpful.  At the gate it is usually very hectic as people crowd near the entrance.  Once on board things calm down and you can settle in and watch a movie.  We sat in row 13 which has plenty of leg room as it the emergency exit in the Airbus 321.  Delta Comfort + has bananna's, Kind Bars and almonds all very good for you.  Wish they could add a few more healthy options.  I do tend to eat the cookies.  :)"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Delta Comfort + Almost perfect,"Upgraded to Delta + for $44 each way.  This gets you quicker boarding and free spirits and wine.  Snacks are so so and think Delta can do better.  The banana, Kind Bars, Almonds are very delicious wish there could be more healthy snacks.   Prior to flight Delta is pretty good at keeping you up to date on the flight as are the pilots once on board.  The boarding process needs some work.  A lot of confusion and people crowding the gates.  Gate agents 90% of the time say your name while scanning your pass.  Once on board it is easy to find overhead space.  The bathrooms were very clean and so was the cabin.  We sat in row 12 in Delta Comfort + so we had very good leg room.  Flight arrived early."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Flying with Delta Air Lines,"We flew with Delta as part of a Love Holidays trip to New York in Feb 2020 & from check in to arrival the service it was without fault. The in-flight attendants, entertainment & food was great and even the luggage handling has to be praised as our bags were waiting for us when we cleared customs. No hanging around at all. Top marks & highly recommended."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Several Delta Flights as good as can be,"Flew to and from mexico City .. once from LA , once from mexico City  Delta does an excellent job ... efficient ... thoughtful,  no long lines... made sure I had a wheelchair ."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Impressed with Delta Comfort International,"I travel internationally once or twice a year but have not had the opportunity to travel Delta until last week.  I flew Delta flight 119 Paris to Lax. I flew Delta Comfort seat (I believe 35G).   The price to upgrade to a comfort seat is pricey but it really is worth it. The extra space on an 11 hr flight really helps.  Included 2 meals and appetizer with first meal, drinks (wine & liquor) snacks through out the flight.  A small travel package in each seat that included sleep mask, ear plugs, one time use tooth paste and small tooth brush (nice touch).  Attendants were all so nice and the plane was clean. In flight entertainment movies good selection with new releases & old to choose from.  Flight was on time & when the plane had to be pulled back to another gate as we landed pilot let’s know exactly what was going on.  I really enjoyed my flight and was pleasantly surprised with Delta.  Would fly them again for sure."
Date of travel: March 2020,10,"Website is a trap! Pull up, pull up!","I had booked some decent seats when the Delta website temped me with a first class upgrade that lead to 5 hours of customer service hell and  some of the worst seats on the planes, not to mention a ton of stress."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Delayed flight causes 10 hour layover,"Leaving Tampa airport we sat on the runway for 2.5 hours. Delta said that the airport had shut down for whatever reason causing all planes to stay put. That being said I had a 2 hour layover at JFK...I had asked the flight attendant ahead of time if there was anyway I could make my connecting flight...she proceeded to tell me that I should be fine seeming how other Delta aircrafts can see when others are landing and what passengers are on certain plains. All being said she told me they would hold the plane. I got to my gate right at 12:30, leaving me 13 minutes to run through JFK all to have them shut the door in my face and not let me on. Next flight out to Burlington wasn’t for another 10 hours and they had no interest in accommodating me. Worst customer service."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"Needed airport wheelchair assistance in both Boston and Bermuda, and Delta was great!","First class to Bermuda is a short flight (1:45 in the air) but handled nicely by Delta. We needed wheelchair assistance in both Boston and Bermuda airports, and Delta provided great help! Flights were clean and on time, and the attendants always friendly. This is our twelfth flight to Bermuda in the past 5 years, and we plan to stick with Delta."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great employees,"From the moment we arrived at the airport until our final touchdown, every Delta employee we encountered was welcoming, pleasant, personable, friendly, and attentive to our needs/requests. One thing I did notice about the Delta counter staff and flight attendants:  if there was a request/ need that could not be met, each one explained clearly and pleasantly why it could not be honored, so there was no misunderstanding or negative interpretation of their response.  This was our first flight on Delta. We fly United 100% if the time, however, after this experience, Delta is our new go-to carrier."
Date of travel: August 2019,10,"Ranks amongst the Worst International Flights...Atlanta GA to Lagos, Nigeria is very ""Condescending""","Caveat: This review pertains only to this particular flight/route on Delta from USA to and from Nigeria. I have had fairly decent experience on Delta Airlines (same seat classification/category) from Beijing to Toronto earlier in the same year:This flight ranks amongst one of the worst International Flights in over fifty years of travelling around the globe. One cannot help but notice how the ""check-in"" counter staff members were so condescending, insolent and arrogant in their attitudes toward paying Customers. Is it simply because this is a flight to Nigeria (Africa)? I wonder!I have never experienced  Airlines employees ""begging"" for money from passengers seating and waiting in the lounge to board a plane onward to Africa! When asked, certain priggish and pompous Delta Airline flight -attendants rudely retorted stating that asking for donations to help ""poor and helpless"" Americans is the norm in USA... Wrong!It is Pitiful to witness how low America has sunk!To worsen the situation, the In-flight service was so disgusting words alone simply cannot do justice. We started off by boarding and ""Old"" dilapidated aircraft with a past-due date, ready to be recycled in the junkyard! The poor quality of food and drinks served on board, defective entertainment units in more than three (3) seat rows within my vicinity (my seat included), dirty washrooms...Just Appalling! Delta Airlines is not treating Nigerians (Africans) Right, and this attitude is Wrong especially at such and altitude!I refuse to ever fly Delta Airlines to Africa, never again...NEVER!!!The catch is in the ""direct flight""...but do not be deceived. You will be ""uncomfortable"" for almost 12 hours while feeling directly in hell up above.PS: I wrote to Delta and only for them to insult my intelligence with 5,000 bonus points as a ""pacifier""...Jokers!"
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Horrible!,"We made our reservations 11 months in advance and paid for Delta Comfort.  The morning of our flight we received a text that we had been moved from row 10 in Delta Comfort to row 32, the next to the last row in the plane!  We were basically told ""too bad, so sad"" by the agent on the phone.  When I asked to take the survey at the end of the call, she put me on hold for over 5 minutes.  I never got to answer the survey.  THEN we get to the airport and they call us up to the reservation stand. ""Good news, we have you seats in Comfort"" . When it was time to board we found out this wasn't true.  Only one seat available in Comfort.  We were told by the agent to ""GET UP AGAINST THE WALL!""  Treated like criminals.  We were promised Delta vouchers, Gift Cards and a refund for being down-graded.  Have not received a thing!THERE IS A CHOICE - DON'T FLY DELTA AGAIN!!!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,First with Delta,"On time departure, excellent inflight service, on time arrival.  A little disappointed that the short flight had the movie screens and the long flight did not. Nevertheless, I had GoGo inflight and used my own device to watch movies and tv.  All in all Delta delivered!"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Good flight,"The seats are small and there is no way around that, but the food wasn't bad and the ice cream was a real treat.  You can charge any device and there was a large selection of movies and TV series to keep anyone busy.  Until Scotty comes up with a workable transporter, this is the best way to travel."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,"Finally, Smooth Domestic Travelling!","My flight was from Richmond's Byrd International Airport to San Francisco International Airport with a stopover in Atlanta's Hartfield-Jackson International Airport. *First Leg of Flight*The first leg of the flight was a small plane with no TVs, but they definitely compensated that with the amazing WiFi which allows you to text your family and friends from the sky at great speeds. If you are a T-Mobile customer, you will be able to use the WiFi for other purposes such as browsing and watching videos. The seat itself was a really comfortable seat and the flight was very clean. The service was great on this leg of this flight. *Second Leg of Flight*This part of the flight was amazing as well because it included the best features of the previous leg plus the entertainment factor. The service was amazing, the cleanliness of the airplane itself was very clean, and the entertainment options were practically endless. The seats were also very comfortable on this part of the flight. In conclusion, if you were to take a flight with Delta, you won't be let down whatsoever. It was an amazing flight and I would gladly recommend this flight to anyone of my family and/or friends."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Needs to improve!,"Just got back, Feb 29 from a month long trip to Dubai...and Maldives....booked round trip, business class with Delta, Atlanta to Dubai, flew out on Jan 29... left Atlanta on KLM, service very good, seats..video good.....food not so good. On the return flight, Dubai to Paris on Air France, plan had been remodeled, great video..service...seats and food! From Paris to Atlanta on Delta, Delta One business, not good...old small video screens, seats just ok, service was very good.... food was terrible! Terrible as in the main course, tried the steak..very tough..sent it back, then tried the chicken...dark meat with terrible seasoning.... so if you can use Air France! Best experience flying business class has been Qatar!!!"
Date of travel: March 2020,10,"Misplaced luggages, stinky plane ,poor customer service","Flew from Atlanta the plane smells stinky, the AC above me was super hot even the passengers  infront  of me complained at the stewardess.my table won’t close and while we were on our way out usually the crew would thank you,these 2 stewardess were seared infront of each other by the aisle and wouldn’t even thank or smoke at the passengers,I did say thank you,they never responded ignored me instead,I love delta and I always fly with them but this is the worst flight I ever flown and to make the experience most worst,our luggages were misplaced we were told to pick them up in the morning at 11am,imagine what a big inconvenience to us coz from flying we were exhausted then we wanted to stay in bed the whole day but did not happened coz we had to pick up the luggages from the airport, if we will let them deliver at our house it will be later in the afternoon, which I can’t take that coz I have presents that needs to be mailed out that day,"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Start of Vacation,"Good start to vacation, good check in and wonderful inflight staff. Will fly with you again when I travel later this year and again in February 2021"
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Not Handicapped accessible,"Normally I really like Delta but I couldn't believe when we walked out of the terminal at Kona and to the plane, that they had steps up to the entry.  If there were people in wheel chairs, they would have had to be carried up the steps.  I was behind a lady who had two canes and she could barely get up the steps.  My wife who has a bad knee took one step at a time and I could tell that she was in some pain."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Comfortable and On-Time Flights,"We opted for Business Class to get extra leg room and also storage. It was very comfortable and the flight attendants were extremely helpful. It was clear they wanted us to have a comfortable flight, especially considering the distance."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,36 hours in San Francisco,It doesn't matter how long I stay in San Francisco. I always leave vowing to return. The flights are quick so it's easy to commit to going back. Delta's first class service was fabulous. Thanks to my 360 traveling companion for making sure that we fly in style. And I don't mind waiting for my flight when I know that I can hang out in the Delta lounge. My only negative comment on the Delta lounges is when single travelers spread their stuff out on both sides of themselves so that only every other seat is available and people traveling together have to split up.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Flight to Punta Canha,"Glad we upgraded to premium economy! Nicer seats, snacks, drinks and quickly off the flight! The return to JFK was ahead of schedule. Only drawback is clearing customs coming home. It took close to an hour!"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Bad customer service - contradictory answers,"Summary:  Because of a passport issue, we were unable to travel on our booked flight, but were not told that until the day before the flight.  We were then told we could use the ticket up to a year, and the fee for changing the flight ($300 each) would be waived.  We then made 4 different calls to Delta about rescheduling, and each call contradicted the previous one.  We are now at risk of losing $1900.Contacted Delta	Date	Experience	March 17, 2019	We booked our flight to Prague, to leave Sept. 2 2019, and return Oct 1, 2019, and provided our passport numbers as requested.1	Sept 1, 2019	When we tried to check in online, we were told that one of our passports wasn’t valid. We called Delta and were told we couldn’t travel because the passport would expire only 2 weeks after our return, and 3 months were required.  This was the day before the flight – way too late to do anything about it.  When we asked if we could fly anyway, and take the chance that we could persuade Czech customs to allow us to enter the country, we were told that could only be done at the Check-In desk at the airport, and we had to go there.2	Sept 2, 2019	We spent $80 for a car to JFK, but the Check-in agent told us there were no exceptions, and we could not travel.  She gave us a corporate number to call.We called the number from the airport, and were told we could reschedule before March 17 2020, and travel before September 2020, and they would waive the #300 fee.  She was noting all this in our record, she said.We spent another $70 to get home.  And of course renewed the passport, which took several weeks.  Because of health issues, we couldn’t travel again until 2020.3	Feb 16, 2020	Reversed the information in call #2.We called Customer service to reschedule the flight for September 2020.  We were told:•	If it were a domestic flight, we could book before March 17 and travel before September.•	Because it was an international flight, we had to travel before March 17.This was the opposite of what we had been told previously.  She confirmed it with her supervisor, then gave us a corporate number to call.4	Feb 18, 2020	Reversed the information in call #3.We called the corporate number, and were told the information Customer Service had given us was incorrect. There was no information in our record from the call in September. The agent (Touriya) said:•	If it were a domestic flight, we had to book before March 17 and travel before March 17.•	Because it was an international flight, there was no requirement for the travel date, other than in 2020, but we had to book before March 17.She said repeatedly she was noting this in our record (we could hear her typing).  We should call the same corporate number again when we had decided the exact dates and flight.5	Feb 24, 2020	Reversed the information in call #4.We called the corporate number to change the flight.  The agent (Holly) said Touriya had given us wrong information, and there were no notations in our record:•	If it were a domestic flight, we had to book before March 17 but could travel later.•	Because it was an international flight, we had to book and travel before March 17.•	We asked if an exception could be made in the circumstances, and she contacted “her ticket agent,” who said the September dates were “too far out”, and we had to travel within 45 days – first she said commence before 45 days, then she said the travel had to be completed within 45 days – by May 1."
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Had not flown Delta for years; t was a pleasant surprise.,"Checkin, gate announcements, attitude of all employees, cleanliness of cabin--all excellent.  We usually fly Southwest (which we love) but they do not fly to Palm Springs so we booked Delta.  There are no nonstop flights available with any airline."
Date of travel: April 2019,50,Delta seems to have comprehended what people want in flying,Flying from a Delta hub is nice since the terminal is better situated and in Detroit you don't have to deal with all the crowds on the budget airlines. Complimentary TSA pre-check was awesome. In fight entertainment and service was excellent.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Best USA Carrier,"I love Delta. The ease of flying is nice with them. The flight attendants are courteous, the food is good, the service is excellent. I actually paid more for Delta because I refuse to fly on some other American carriers! Thank you, Delta!"
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Great Service,Delta airlines offers great service to its Customers.  I especially want to acknowledge Reese of RDU for her great customer service. She really helped my aging parents who were recently traveling to Nairobi through Paris. Kudos Delta airlines.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Amazing Flight Staff!,"I just wanted to thank Joelia (spelling may be incorrect) and Donald for making our Delta flight amazing!!! They were so positive, energetic, and hilarious; they definitely made the experience even more amazing. We had not flown Delta before this trip, but because of the amazing staff and great movies / entertainment, we will definitely be Delta passengers for life. Thank you again, Joelia and Donald!!"

Date of travel: February 2020,40,Comfort was good,Flew with a friend and both families with several children and nannies. We took most of the delta confort zone which was good since we had our own zone of the plane
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Overcharged by 5000 mileage points -,"I called reservations for this flight and bringing a puppy back. I was assured that the 27,000 points (5,000 high than my round trip ticket) would cover the puppy one way. Once I got to Newark, I was forced to buy a Ticket for $125 for the dog. I when thru 4 hrs of customer care and was told - sorry but no matter what the agent says when booking we can charge more. We apologize yet we will do nothing. I guess being lied to is ok with this Airline -   Beware."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Two Outstanding Delta Employees,The Gate Agent Jaime was one of the most professional and nicest persons  I have ever met. She helped my wife and I so beautifully.The flight attendant Jean on the leg from Atlanta to Hartford was terrific she made my wide wife and I feel at home and important customers. Well done Delta Airlines.
Date of travel: July 2019,30,Decent airline,Delta airline is a decent airline. It definitely doesn’t have the bells and whistle‘s like JetBlue but if you’re doing a short flight this can be your way to go. Not as pricey and has decent accommodations. However when I used Delta on my way back home from Charleston I was on a small aircraft with only two seats and had to sit in the back. Very noisy and uncomfortable. But That’s only because I had Economy and had to pick my seats later. But if you can’t afford JetBlue definitely Delta or is the way to go. Very accommodating.
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Flight to Research Investigator meeting,"This was flight 3 out of 4 I traveled this past weekend . All the flight were good as usual. But, the crew of Victoria,Nancy, and Brian were exceptional. The flight was full and we had a  slight incident during boarding and Victoria used her flawless Spanish  to correct the problem. We were able to take off and even landed 15 minutes early. Which helped me make my final flight to Birmingham. The flight crew of Delta 1465 were very good also. But, since the flight was only 20 minutes I didn't have a lot of time to interact with them. But, we also landed 15 minutes early also. So, Delta airlines crews 2127 and 1465 were excellent today for me."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Delta is the best airline!,Delta is amazing! We always have an amazing experience when we fly with them. The flight attendants are great!! I’ve seen them go out of there way several times to accommodate customers. We will always fly Delta❤️
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Hawaii,Overall the flight went well. Detroit to LAX then into Honolulu.   Plane was clean and service was good no issues.  Layover help with stretching legs
Date of travel: March 2020,50,Super Short Flight Aruba to Minneapolis!,Delta has a flight that goes from Aruba to Minneapolis direct in 6 hrs 11 minutes.  Last night they beat that time and it was 5 hrs 40 minutes.  What a fantastic flight!  We flew Delta Comfort which I highly recommend.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Fast Flight,This flight was very comfortable and very fast. 3.5 hours from take off till landing. Usual problems with Delta by boarding first class passengers first. These people stand in the isles talking causing traffic jams when the rest of the passengers board. They are so special that they do not set down until they feel like it. The other problem is that Delta does not enforce carry on baggage size and number. I have seen people  with three carry on bags with at least one of them being a regular sized suitcase. This is not fair to the people that play by the rules and pay the extra $30.00 to check a bag.
Date of travel: February 2020,10,allergy sufferers beware,"This was a flight on behalf of virgin and virgin were advised about my daughters nut allergy well before flying and they assured me it would be dealt with. Virgin were here at going out but delta didn’t seem to care. I advised as soon as we were seated, then advised another person when he asked about children’s food. And the. Adult menu came out and it had pecan nut salad and chicken pesto was another option. They still hadn’t announced (as other flights do) that there was a nut allergy person on board. I expressed my concerns again and was asked if I had epipens and if I did that I shouldn’t worry????? Then food service was on its way round and 2 pecan salad dishes came sliding off the trolley and scattered all around myself and daughter.   I couldn’t believe it. I then had to get on my hands and knees to finish cleaning up the nuts that the steward had left. I spent the next 6 hours worrying! Very poor service and nobody cared!"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Flight,"We boked a flt from boston to rome italy fort the 25 of feb 2020 but changed our flt to paris, due to the wide spread of the coronavirus in Italy. With some haggling, we did change our reservation (Boston to Paris return) we did loose our money on our Paris to rome."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Excellent Delta flight,"Our round trip flights to and from Detroit to Ft.Myers were pleasant. Price was reasonable, staff and service excellent."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Flying economy with style,"Since most of us are not wealthy, we're stuck to economy class and usually treated like garbage by cabin crew. However, that's not the case with Delta Airlines. They pamper you with attention, welcome cocktail, delicious meals, plenty of leg space, finest movies and TV shows. Cabin crew is as helpful and welcoming as possible. Next time, I'm flying Delta."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,"Code share Alitalia, awful experience.","Horrible experience on Alitalia, Delta codeshare.  Delta has no response.  I will never fly either of these airlines."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Nice flights,Delta is my go to airline.These flights lived up to their high standard.  They were on time and service was very good.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,In flight cabin crew was outstanding.,"The flight left early, which from JFK is a miracle in itself. The in-flight crew was outstanding and accommodating. The plot kept us informed well in advance of the impending turbulence that we encountered."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Perfect !!!,"Perfect! Nothing to say, by far the best company I've ever travelled with ! No delays, no loss of luggage (and yet we had 5 in the hold), very friendly cabin crew, very good food for the price (welcome cocktail, alcohol and soft drinks unlimited, starter, main course, dessert and many snacks). I recommend !!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,👍👍👍,"My first experience with Delta and I'm satisfied. Great on-board staff, good food, enough leg space. Everything was good."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"Smooth, on time flight as usual","Flight was  smooth, on time and comfortable.  My wife's wheelchair was waiting for us on the jetway as we deborded.  Checked bags came out promptly.  The best part is we paid for trip with frequent flyer miles."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Delta is Head’s and shoulders above United or American,"I hadn’t flown Delta in probably 10 years, mostly due to flight schedules. Wow, they have improved and the others have declined. I was impressed from the start - the plane was new and CLEAN, the staff were friendly and helpful - they came around frequently; nice selection of 4 snacks; WiFi and movies galore !! Right at your seat - current Oscar nominated movies. And Live TV. My experience on the other 2 airlines mentioned has been less than in all of the categories I listed above."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,they did a great job,"Delta did a great job getting us home after our original flight was delayed ,and even got our luggage rerouted so we would have it when we landed. It goes without saying the service  and condition of the plane were excellent"
Date of travel: February 2020,30,"They’ll get you there, sometime","Waited for flight and at last minute it was announced they brought the wrong plane to the ramp. That’s encouraging. Then had to wait for the right plane and took off late. No one knew what was going on, once in Atlanta the gate number changed 3 times. It’s just an unorganized mess."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Direct flights are awesome,Never had a bad experience on delta. Always pleasant crew! On time and early with this flight...rarely late!
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Pleasant Experience,Delta has become my new favorite airline. Smooth flights with short connecting times. Seats must be comfortable as my husband does not complain.
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Wasted 1200.00 to upgrade four seats,This the the biggest waste of money for 1 inch of leg room.  We were assigned seats across from the rest room are you fricken serious I paid 1200 dollars for the stink of crap.  Really free alcohol not when you are flying to hawaii.  Oh yah you can get Oreos sorry that is the most expensive Oreos I have ever bought.  Delta frankly your service sucks.  We never arrived on time to our destination but were told by staff that we did just because you say we were on time does not make it true.  How dumb do you think we are.   Also the 1st class it like economy class on American Airlines.  Delta your airlines really does suck.  Thanks for stealing my money and for not killing me.
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Bob,"Worst flight experience in 45yrs.  Had to search computer boards for seat assignments, no ticket provided.  TSA says “don’t touch bags” between flights, then says “empty your pockets into your bags”."
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Nothing has changed in 5 years since I flew this carrier,"I help someone who can’t speak English, has the tiny bag for under seat. Airline didn’t tell him  how to board. I’m in econ no frills class so I ask if he can board with me- and answer was yes- doing Deltas job as they should have clarified how he should board- then as boarding - agent says “can’t jump boarding class” The staff is as nasty as ever and I was Diamond for years because I HAD to fly them to get to my destination."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Smooth Sailing❤️ Safe flight,"Great staff at the Appleton INternational  Airport.  Smooth bag check and onTime departure. Flight crew was great! I love that Delta has partnered with Habitat for Humanity!!! It’s great to help out a noN-Profit!Our return trip was smooth and no problems, great flight crew and great ground crew. Thanks for keeping us safe❤️"
Date of travel: January 2020,30,Previously Known As Kamekaze Airlines.,"First the good.  The flight was on time. As for the rest, not so great. Our seats were in the row in front of the rest rooms.  Every time the door slammed, everything shook. Worse still, these seats don't recline but the ones in the row in front do recline. Food service?? It makes you wish that they returned to offering Animal Crackers. The usual baggage service. If you have two bags, one comes out quickly and the other is the last one to come out.  That's if you are lucky. Delta schedules from Fort Lauderdale are poor. I'll look for another choice next time."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Easy travel.,Non-stop both ways.  Everything was on time.  Made trip much easier.  Only problem was we couldn't get seat assignment until the gate opened.  We made the reservations about 6 months ahead.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Great flight,"Great flight service and totally on time on main flight and connecting flight. Return flight also on time. Both flights we had great customer service.  The only thing I would change is After first class , to load the plane from the back to the front."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,"Flight to Savannah, GA",The flight was on time with a stop in ATL. I have no complaints about the flight or the flight attendents. Just the lack of snacks on board!
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great customer service,"I just wanted to comment on the amazing customer service I received by Robert Jones in Atlanta. Rarely do you receive personal and exceptional customer service over the phone anymore, and it shouldn’t go unnoticed. I fly quite a bit and it is typically unremarkable. I ran into some issues with a flight voucher from a past trip that I couldn’t take, and Robert was extremely helpful and compassionate. Hopefully a supervisor of his sees this review because he should be commended for the great job that he does. Thanks Robert!"
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Where's the suitcases?,"The flight itself was fine, food was good, staff efficient and friendly.  The problem?  Our bags did not arrive in Paris with our flight.  We filled out the missing baggage claim at airport and advised them we were heading to London and gave the London Hotel address,  Despite numerous calls to Delta, they kept giving us conflicting info.  Evidently, the bags were in the control of Air France, one of Delta's ""business partners"" and they could not access the Air France bag system.  One bag arrived at our hotel  several days later, and the other was finally sent to the home address having been on a much better and longer vacation that we had,"
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Exit row volunteers after everyone seated!,"Our group of 4 paid for premium economy. After plane had loaded, they had to ask repeatedly for volunteers to move to exit row. Why do they just not make them available from the get go? Charging customers for something and then giving it away for free afterwards is not very good for customer satisfaction."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Nice flight,"Considering this was an overnight long haul flight it was brilliant . Staff were friendly and attentive. Bit of a rigmarole to actually get on the plane but once on could not fault service.  Food menu was great, lots of free snacks and drinks throughout the flight. In flight entertainment was endless much more choice than out flight out to NYC with virgin. Staff were brilliant with my son, bringing him Oreo cookies and making sure everyone is ok. Flight left jfk and landed in lhr at 6am , my son was very tired but cheered up when the lovely staff came round and gave the children a pair of pilot wings to pin on their tops!"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,"Easy, on time and good prices flight.","We used to take the same flight out of SFO for years. Then my husband retired and we moved to the Sierra Nevada mountains a year and a half ago. Now the closet major airport is in LA,a four hour drive I thought it would be a horrible e travel day. We decided to go down the night before and stay near the airport at the Crown Plaza, because they had a great fly/stay price. We left our car there for three weeks no  worries!  The flight was on time and arrived early  only 2 1/2 hour flight.  We arrived in PV refreshed and ready to  go out and have fun!  Delta treated us great, and we were able to upgrade for only $40 more per ticket!  I'd do it again."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Orlando to Detroit,We had a wonderful flight! We were moved to the exit seating with more leg room for us to stretch out and our flight attendant was absolutely lovely!
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Daytona,"Very nice flight, excellent service. The crew was friendly and helpful.  Even when there was a little turbulence, we had amazing care."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Had a good flight,The flight was good. I watched a movie on the planes screen without an issue. I didn't have any earbuds with me but they sold me a pair for $2 so not outrageous.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great flying with Delta!,"I love flying Delta airlines. They're friendly, courteous, willing and able to take care of all my needs."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Enjoy the friendly service,I am a regular/frequent flyer and have been on all the major airlines.  Delta has always treated me great and given the best service of all the airlines I’ve been on.  I will continue to use delta for all my travel needs.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Nice flight,"The fight was very comfortable , we had the opportunity to get the seats that we wanted, you can have some beveriage , snack for free that is great. Also you have the opportunity to watch movies, news or play games that is great when you don't want to use your cellphone. The flight attendance are very nice making your flight experience good."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Frequent Flyer Program Lousy,"We use there card with American Express and do lots of domestic flights as we support our military family in another city.  We try to save our miles for that overseas trip every so often.  Guess what, it is a nightmare to try to use your miles and get an upgrade.  They must limit the seats they allocate toward this as you can hardly find any.  The ask for a huge amount of miles.  We decided to use miles + cash and even that was unsatisfactory.  BTW, you usually have to wait for a call back of 30 to 60 minutes if you want to speak with anyone.  I was finally able to book something as I was frustrated.   It turned out the return flight was too early for us so the next day (much less than 24 hours) I called to cancel.  Any decent business would just cancel the ""pending"" charge on you card.  No, I have to wait for 7 to 10 days as I recall they said.  This might be good for their bottom line, but it certainly does not make them look like fair business people.  We are planning on redeeming the points for some outdated merchandise and getting rid of these expensive ""come on"" cards."
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Flight to Punta Cana,"Had a great flight expirience  using Delta to Get to Punta Cana , everything went smoothly on time , no issues with the Flights that would get 5 stars But . The one major issue we had was on the ground. We did have a piece of luggage that was damaged. TSA locked ripped off causing damage to buckle and a Pandora Bracelet stolen from the luggage , other items ransacked. Thta was disappointing since we have to have trust that our personal belongings will be safe and secure."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Flight to Vegas,"Selection of entertainment helped make the time in flight fly right by! Movies for adults and kids, TV shows and games offered free of charge! Seats were very comfortable! Check in at the airport was quick and easy. A great trip!"
Date of travel: February 2020,10,"Ghastly, horrible and never again","We had the misfortune of being booked with Delta on the penultimate leg of a hitherto problem free around the world trip. It all started well enough and then went downhill after that. We boarded the plane on time and were then told we would have a 15 minute delay while they fixed the parking brake. But they couldn’t and eventually had to disembark. But before that there were many announcements about another 20 minutes, another 15 minutes and so on. They then discovered they had no crew to fly the plane even if they could fix it and would have to wait until 6 am the following morning when in short succession it became 7am, 6.30am, 8am. All in all a nine hour delay. We were offered a hotel around 2/3 in the morning. As the flight was at 6 we plus most of the others stayed in the airport and were given thin flimsy covers. As it happened the flight was after 8 and not 6 so we could have gone. A total shambles and never again. One of the Delta employees was extremely rude and the replacement cabin staff were more interested in gossiping about the passengers and looked as if they had just rolled out of bed and definitely didn’t want to be on the flight.  On landing and taking off several seats were not checked to be in the upright positionWe shall be claiming compensation."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Delta Will Not Provide Doc on Flight Cancellation,We had to cancel our flights due to an auto accident & our insurance company requires documentation to show that we had cancelled the flight.  Despite no refund Delta refuses to provide a statement that we cancelled the flights.  We have spent hours waiting to speak to reps.  Their online system will not provide the data we require.  We have lost our money !!!
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Delta Will Not Provide Statement We Had Cancelled Flight,We had to cancel our flight due to a car accident.  We need evidence of that cancellation from Delta to provide to our insurance company for compensation.  Delta will not provide it.  Not a good company to deal with.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,First Class Baby,"All went great, all segments where early or onetime, flight attendants and flight crews did a great job, breakfast and dinner was rather tasty, no negative issues at all"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Delta is an amazing carrier,"Flew Delta from Amsterdam to Seattle and enjoyed the trip.  It’s a long trip and being it was the second leg of a very long journey, the seats started feeling tiring.  Hard to get comfortable in economy.  Food was good...I actually ate it.  Flight attendants were helpful and friendly."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Smooth Boarding and Flight,"Our flight boarded smoothly and on time.  We actually left a few minutes early.  Arrived on time in Miami, the wait for baggage was a little longer than we are accustomed to, but they had several flights arriving around the same time, so it was a bit busier than usual."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,I would not fly delta again! Fees are a Rip off,I would not fly delta again with the outrageous  fees they charge for baggage and to get an assigned seat. They hide the fact on their website that after 2 bags they can and will charge at least 150 for your third bag. To get a seat assignment fees are really crazy too basically I spend as much on baggage and seat assignments as I did for our tickets. This is why I continue to go southwest delta you suck.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Comfort plus worth it,"Easy, convenient, non stop, several options on time and using Delta American Express 1 suitcase is free. Good prices.  On time service."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Too many boarding groups,"The gates have a small divider for priority and all others. And , although priority has already boarded they want all other passengers to stand on the side farthest from the desk - which is silly. It looks ridiculous whether no one is standing there or not. In addition there are about 8 different groups called to board: 1-parents w/kids & needing assistance; 2-military; 3-priority; 4-not priority but before other groups; 5-not as important as #4; 6-main cabin 1; 7-main cabin 2; 8-anyone left over. Now, once you get on the plane, there are actually one 3 sections: 1st class, main-comfort (slightly bigger seats) and all others. The vast majority of the seats and passengers are main cabin. So, why not just call 3 groups: parents,  those needing assistance, military; 2-priority; 3- all others. I have flown many times and there are three groups which walk up when called and those are the three groups."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Amazong as Always,"As always, Delta exceeded our expectations for service, on-time travel, and amenities. We will continue to fly Delta as our preferred carrier."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Wonderful experience,My husband and I always are very pleased with Delta. It is the only airline we try to use in our travels.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Best airline for economy flying,Still allowed to have a purse and a carry on with Economy flight.  Cudos to Delta!!! Hope they don't change this as other airlines have.
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Dishonest to frequent flyers.,"After years of flying over 100 flights a year as a Diamond Medallion Member with Delta I am moving away.I remained very loyal to Delta to build status for their perks.What they do NOT tell you:You cannot upgrade to Business, Premium, or First class on any international flights!  You are allowed on other Airlines as a frequent flyer if seats are available.You can upgrade on regional flights if there are seats available, but over the past few years they have no clear reason for not upgrading you on regional flights to first class.  You can be #1 on the list to upgrade and be completely skipped over with no explanation.AND here is the worst... when you reach Higher status you are awarded perk choices like gift certificates, regional upgrades, and the highest coveted, global upgrades.  WHAT THEY DO NOT TELL YOU IS THAT YOU CANNOT BOOK GLOBAL UPGRADES DUE TO DELTA WANTING TO SELL ALL THEIR FIRST CLASS SEATS FIRST!   YOU CAN ONLY BE PUT ON A WAIT LIST ALL THE WAY UP TO THE DAY YOU FLY TO SEE IF THERE MAY BE A SEAT LEFTOVER AND THEN THEY WILL ALLOW YOU TO UTILIZE YOUR GLOBAL UPGRADE CERTIFICATE.  You are also not allowed to use Skymiles along with your Global Upgrade certificate which would allow you to cancel if your upgrade did not come through.  Therefore, you are stuck in a very uncomfortable seat for a very long flight.You remain loyal to a company only to have them scam you in the end.I moved from United to Delta due to on time performance, but I feel Delta is is pulling a bait and switch.  Switching airlines again."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,my review,i had a pleasant and uneventful flight from buffalo to chicago.   my connecting flight to san francisco was also pleasant and uneventful.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Best economy flight for years ,"Flew Delta from London to Atlanta then in to Orlando.   Best economy flight for years.  Same 767, but refurbished.  New in flight screens, comfy seats.  Best of all was the food and drink.  All complimentary with wines, spirits, Prosecco etc.  Regular and often with choices and if that was not enough, go to the galley at the back and get more snacks.  Attentive service and all on time or earlier."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Peace and Calm Experience,The ride was smooth and peaceful and the attendants were respectful and attentive.  The movies were excellent and the technology was perfect!!!
Date of travel: January 2020,50,On time and on schedule,"In the interest of full-disclosure I fly Delta a lot.  There are deals to be found, but when you add in all the extras, the costs are comparable.  I hate to be nickled and dimed to death on other airlines when you find a great deal and then have to go through a series of questions each adding an extra expense to your ticket, e.g., Did you want a seatbelt on your flight?  If yes, there's a $20 fee each way.  Did you want an oxygen mask in the event of a drop in cabin pressure?  If yes, there's a $20 fee each way.   With Delta the price is the price.  I do hold Silver Medallion status and thus get one bag free, but I don't have ridiculous fees tacked on to the airfare.  Moreover, Delta's service is prompt, punctual and professional.  They are my airline of choice."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Free movies,We got rerouted from Minneapolis to Atlanta. The thing that saved the extra 4 hour flight time was free movies. They had a wheelchair waiting for my Dad in Atlanta as our connection was super tight and he had a bad knee. That was appreciated.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,my review,i had a pleasant and uneventful flight from san francisco to chicago.   i changed planes in chicago.   my flight from chicago to buffalo was also pleasant and uneventful.  both flights were on time.
Date of travel: January 2020,30,Comfort plus was not worth it,"We flew comfort plus, the leg room was nice but the service was terrible. I thought we were supposed to get “extra snacks and alcohol”. We got neither.  I have flown comfort plus before and it was special, this flight was not. Probably just a bad flight crew. Will make me think before I fly delta again."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Delta continues to be the best choice,"Delta, Delta, Delta you continue to make my travel stress free when flying with you.Every one is extremely and genuinely friendly and accomadating.Delta is always one step ahead of the competition!!Always on time! Great connecting flights Thanks for hiring Great Employees."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Amazing airline,"Would highly recommend delta airlines , travelled with friends to New York Service was amazing to size of seats to flight attendants they made you feel at ease , friendly service was amazing Entertainment excellent"
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Delta Airlines used to suck but got improved,"Delta flights used to be delayed a lot and their planes outdated.  But my experience in the past 1-2 years has improved a lot, with better punctuality & updated fleets.  Also, another +ve part is that now I can feel a sense of accountability in their staff & attendants in keeping the flight on time, which certainly helps. In the past, they gave you a feeling that they didn't care that much."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Delta First Class To Puerto Rico,"Flew Delta to PR. First Class seats.   Service was very good. Staff friendly and attentive.  Priority check-in ,security and boarding was very smooth.  Flight going and returning home ahead of scheduled arrival time.  I generally fly only two airlines Delta is one of them."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Delta is better than United,"I am a long-time United Frequent Flyer, but Delta is definitely better than United.  In Comfort+ (Delta's name for Premier Economy)  alcoholic beverages are free, they come by with snacks at least twice on a 3 hour flight, the seats are very comfortable, and the entertainment system has a large number of choices."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Upgrades in economy to Bermuda not worth the money,"I have had issues with Delta in the past, but this flight was fine -- short and uneventful. On the way back our flight window was moved up and we arrived 20 minutes early. It's only a little more than 90 minutes in the air -- time for one pass of the drinks cart. So if you are paying for the main cabin plus with extra leg room and free drinks, it's not really necessary for this short hop -- and you will get only one ""free"" drink for your effort."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Unexpected Change with Great Ending,I arrived at the airport on time only to find out that my flight in the connecting city was being delayed. Delta already had options available for me that that would allow me to make an even better connection. It was better because it got me to San Diego nearly an hour earlier than I was expected. We arrived at 9:45 pm rather than nearly 11 pm
Date of travel: December 2019,50,NYC to Jacksonville Florida,Flight is pretty quick just over 2 hours.  Flight attendants are very friendly and attentive.  Great service while in flight.  Operated by Endeavor Air.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Orlando to New York City,"In one word... Efficient.Delta has high standards. Great entertainment center with screen on the back of the seat in front of you.  And this equipment (airplane) might be the cleanest inside, ever."
Date of travel: July 2019,50,Nice flight,"Check in was slow and it was not easy to find information about the flight, so I recommend to be early. I lost a lot of time during checking, the best would be to checking from home. Flight departed was on time, and the service was very good. Snacks are poor and always the same. Staff is very professional."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,JFK to LHR Great flight!,Boarding was very fast and on time departure.  Service is always enjoyable on the overseas flights.  Food and wine was very good.  Sat in row 17.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Flight 1097 from Orlando (MCO) to LGA NYC on time and early arrival!,"The return flight was as smooth as the original flight to Orlando.  We upgraded to Delta Comfort and were seated in row 11.  The upgrade comes with free wine, beer, alcohol and snacks.  Snacks cold be better."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Delta 1097 On time and Early Arrival,"Delta Comfort seat 11E, flight took off on time and we arrived early.  With Delta Comfort you board right behind 1st Class and you get free wine, beer and alcohol.  You also get snacks but I feel they could do better with the food portion the snacks are kind of cheap."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Norfolk to Atlanta to Austin—great!,Flights on time. Great service at checki-in’s and on board both flights. Even roomy in middle seat on both flights. On time all the way. Short layover in Atlanta but made it!
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Service with a smile,Leaving on a ice/snow storm morning. Delta came through and did NOT cancel the flight out of Albuquerque. Other airlines did cancel. Smooth sailing all the way!
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Delta is almost always a good experience in to and out of Detroit,"We try to fly Delta Comfort for any longer flights.  Boarding is better and the on board experience is a little nicer with more leg room.  However, service throughout the aircraft is generally good.  The flight attendants are almost always friendly and professional.The planes are clean, the seats are reasonably comfortable, and the snack selections are fine.  Nothing great, but fine.in today's world of flight travel, Delta consistently delivers a decent experience."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Servicing Small Towns,"I was pleased with the seat size and pitch, even though this was a small plane.  I wish the overhead bins had been slightly larger."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great experience,Seats were comfy. Free drinks and snacks. Check in was simple. I would recommend Delta to anyone looking for comfort over cheapest rate. The flight was on time. Baggage was ready when we got to baggage claim.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Vacation's over,Have flown Delta many times as we prefer to fly out of Detroit rather than Toronto.  This was a  straight through flight  and the check in was quick and smooth.  The only somewhat bad thing about it was it was an hour late leaving Miami.  Not sure why.  We did get a notice at about  12:20 pm that our 12:12 pm flight would not be leaving at that time.  Thought that was rather funny seeing it was already several minutes after we should have taken off.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Skip Comfort+,"My husband and I used to ALWAYS paid the extra cost for Comfort+ (aka Premium Economy) on Delta. Since we’ve been flying more frequently lately we’ve made the decision to fly economy and honestly have to say the upcharge for 2-3 extra inches of leg room (seat size & pitch are the same) is not worth it. Perhaps for someone who is very tall it would be, but we have found regular economy seats to be just fine for the 2-4 hour flights we’ve been on recently.  We’d rather save the money for a nice dinner at our destination!"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Direct flight from SLC to London Heathrow,"Delta has stepped UP their international game. The flight was comfortable, on time and the staff were incredibly pleasant and patient. They started off with hot towels for everyone and champagne for the adults and included free wine the rest of the evening. I ordered a special vegetarian meal which was well balanced and nutritious though who ever thinks serving lentils on a long plane ride is a great idea? Despite that it was very good. All in all maybe the most pleasant Delta experience I’ve had after many years of flying"
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Lost baggage and failure to give me promissed $200 gift card,"They said they would give me a discount card for inconvenience of losing baggage, they lied and caused me more hassle."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Forced to check carry on roller bags,"On a Delta flight back from a vacation my family of 4 was forced to check 3 of our roller bags. The gate agent said it was because the flight was full and the overhead bins didn’t have any room left. When we boarded the plane, there was still ample space for our carry-on bags there were several overhead bins that were nearly empty. I wouldn’t have had an issue checking our bags if they were too big or there really wasn’t any space left but I was very disappointed that we were forced to check them for no reason. Unfortunately, this caused us to have to dig into our bags and remove batteries and medications that could fly in the cargo area. Plus, waiting for the baggage resulted in being delayed leaving the airport and caused us to be late for an event. Delta, please be sure there is actually no room when you force people to check baggage."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great flight crew,"Our flight (550) was on time.  Plane was clean upon boarding, staff was very friendly, and flight was smooth."
Date of travel: January 2020,30,January 2020 Atlanta to Cancun,"Boarding started 45 minutes before take off and still the plane didn't leave on time. Flight ride was ok but arrived at Cancun late. Leg room was on this 737-900 is worse than the previous leg, flight, and we were sitting at an exit row. Delta is always changing seats or times or planes.. This flight has been the same for years. I would think Delta would have the time and seat thing figured out.  Also, quit blackening out seat and then a few days before take off. The seats open up for big money.  Let the seats be open from the beginning."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great trip to Miami and Keys,"Flew Delta from Boston to Miami with family for school vacation. Drove to Key Largo spent a couple days then Miami for a couple days then back to Boston. Both flight very booked but on time, crew was very accommodating. Would recommend and will fly again."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,February 2020 Cancun to Atlanta,"We have taken this flight several times and it is rarely on time. Several hours late at times. Boarding is never on time. Seems like Delta staff is confused many times. Delta is always changing something about seating, time, plane, etc."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Delta Airlines Terrific,"Flight attendants well trained, personable and efficiently performed duties as needed. Aircraft was clean. Gate times were on time. All in all, a wonderful experience."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Delta Service Unparallel,Very smooth and comfortable flight.  Flight attendants friendly and helpful. The temperature was also just right.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Excellent TATL flight,"Standard Economy on an A350-900HUGELY impressed with DL. Haven’t flown TATL with DL for a while, should do so more often…Aircraft nice and new, inseat power and large (10” ?) IFE screen, great selection of movies and TV. Handed out little kits with sleepmasks, earplugs and a moist wipe. Legroom was OK, recline reasonable. For some reason I found the seat not to be that comfortable (8 hour flight). Food was good. Service good."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,OK TATL,"Standard Economy on an A330-300.This was not as good a flight as the outgoing (on the newer airbus). Aircraft was not new, but clean. Seat was OK, legroom OK but recline limited. Food was OK, service OK. IFE OK, good selection, 8"" screen worked well.No power sockets."
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Freezing in Cabin,"Aging aircraft, reasonably clean though. Service reasonable overall - but two things killed it for me. They forced everyone in boarding main 3 and below to check trolleys. Not gate check - but check through to final destination. This shouldn't really happen - especially as when I boarded there was enough room for a dozen or so more trolleys....The cabin was freezing. Everyone took out jackets as we had cold air blowing out the vents the entire flight. Why ? nobody knows. Poorly done, Delta."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Mr terry walker,Purchased tickets for first class on plane A321 they call this first class I call it a first class rip off .tight quarters minimal leg room I think they should refund the first class ticket money and I will fly with another air line Will not recommend Delta or will I fly with them again if at all possible Terry. Very dissatisfied!!
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Delta is my favorite airline,"I like Delta airlines, the sits are very comfortable,  I flew with many different airlines like Lufthansa, Austria airlines, Airfrance,American airlines, Spirit and with all of them I had bad experiences but Delta, I like everything about Delta the comfortable sits a lot of space and the service,  I  only had one person that was rude and not willing to help on my trip back from Miami this Sunday February 23.20 it was a Male Spanish speaking person who totally ignored my issues and didn't even try to help me fixed. Then I asked for a manager and I was told to speak to a supervisor I think his name was Hamid or something similar I'm not exactly sure I know it star with H, he was my angel the day and totally was willing to help, my angel fixed the issue with my flight back to New York and totally made my day. What a difference from the first guy the absolutely didn't want to help, the guy probably worked before for Spirit airline he totally didn't belong to Delta where I had with everybody good experience but him. I definitely would fly Delta and would recommend to everyone and if there is any issues with your booking they will fixate like my Angel supervisor Hamid did,I don't know if this is his name but I wish to contact Delta directly and tell them how much the wonderful person help me and how much I love Delta after all my experience with them and especially him. I  do work in hotel as a Front office agent and today I recommended to so many people to fly Delta. And again good bless my angel for what he did for me and made me love Delta forever."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Great time but watch what you book.,"My wife and I booked our flight almost nine months in advance and received the times we requested.  Then about a month before leaving we received an update that our times had been changed.  Then within days, we received another update with yet another change.  Lucky for us we had plenty of time on our hands and could absorb the extra time given to us without affecting our plans.  We found the ground personnel and flight crew very nice and did not have any other problems."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great Airline,"Dependable, on-time airline.  We had a comfortable lay down seat, good food, lots of movies to choose from and good flight attendants."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,A frequent flyer's view of Delta Airlines,It was a full flight but boarding was efficient. The news is the food service has actually improved. From JFK to Milan and back to JFK the new service featured three courses with choices of appetizers and main and nice ice cream for desert. And the food tasted fresh and nice. I was amazed. I generally find Delta to be the best of the big US carriers overseas. Staff are helpful. This applies mostly to cabin staff and phone help. Really low marks for the phone service when things are busy. The call back offer without losing your place on line DOES NOT work. Mostly never get a call back. The company keeps saving money by cheap shots like no club access in many cities where there are no Delta Clubs even when they have reciprocal club agreements and one is a Delta Club member. Another example is the huge number of miles needed for oversea upgrades. I think one should get credit for money one spends on family and friends airline tickets towards medallion status.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,"Delta Flight to Cancun, Mexico","We boarded in an orderly manner and left pretty much on-time. Arrived in Atlanta to catch flight to Cancun,  Mexico. Our flight to Cancun left on-time and arrived fifteen minutes early. It was a delightful flight due to the Flight attendants being courteous and appeared happy we were on their flight. Service was really prompt and pleasent. There were screens to watch movies, TV programs or play games. This made the flight that much more enjoyable because the flight seemed to go by in a flash. Once through customs we found our bags had arrived as expected. Made for a very Happy trip."
Date of travel: January 2020,30,Ohio to Cabo,"This flight connected through ATL.  The layover was only 1hr each way.  The outbound from Dayton OH was delayed due to need to de-ice, which took 1 hour.  Seems that could have been taken care of more efficiently, This of course caused us to miss the connection to SJD.  We were fortunate enough to get the next flight out (standby) and arrived a few hours later than our original flight.The return flight left late, which they were able to make up the time and arrived ATL with 1 hour to get through customs, collect our bags and go back through security for the final leg.  We miraculously made it with only 5mins to spare.This flight should not be offered, the layover times need to be longer.  Delta should know this."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Great flights Terrible baggage handling,The checkin was handled well and despite the late arrival of the aircraft we arrived only 5 minutes late. The crew was welcoming and attentive.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great drinks and movies,"So the thing going for Delta is that they have free entertainment on certain trips of length or time. If they didn't have this, it would have been a miserable flight. The leg room is just awful. But, once again you are able to watch movies and enjoy a tasty alcoholic beverage. Which makes the flight just fly right by."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Reliable transportation,"Delta is always pretty well organized in my opinion and now they are offering lower ticket prices through their basic economy ticket.  You don't select a seat at the time of purchase, but when you check-in (up to 24 hours before the flight).  I was able to select the same seat at check-in, that I would normally have chosen and saved myself a substantial sum (about $125)."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Direct flight,A great direct flight. Flight arrived early and left on time both ways. I watched two movies each way and they were recent Oscar winners. It was great. They provided a sand which meal both ways.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,The Best US Airline,We always have the best experience on Delta flights. They have great customer service and the flying experience is superior to any other US airline.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Good option to travel on Wednesday,"As I traveled on Wednesday, it was nice that flight was not full. Even when I had an economy class ticket, I wouldn't need to be seated at the rear of the plane as other times.I'd like to comment the variety of movies to watch is very wide."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,as expected,"As with all airlines, they are out to grab every nickle and dime, and little concern onthe Economy Comfort of the flying public.  Minimal leg room and narrow seat makes ita challenge for anyone with a weight problem.  Fortunately, I am ok on the weight thing, but saw a man could not fit into the seat.  Really, he could not fit his butt in the seat.  Only solution is some congressional oversight.  I do not like the government involved in my daily life, but in this case, it is for sure the airlines will not make economy travel more comfortable."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Flight to Hawaii,"Traveling to Hawaii was on my bucket list for 10+ years. Well I finally did it. It was a great trip, the flight was loooonnnggggg….. to say the least.  On the way over we went from BWI to Atlanta and Atlanta to Hawaii. almost 9 1/2 hours on the plane from Atlanta to Hawaii. I would not do that again. Thank goodness it was a bigger airplane and you had 2 aisles to move about once you hit the 4+ hour mark.. Delta did provide sandwiches and snacks for the flight (more and more you get nothing when flying a couple hours, so we were pleasantly surprised) the flight crews were great. The flight home was split up much better, went from Hawaii to LA and LA to BWI. (different airline on the way home, will do a review on that one later)"
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Delta cannot be trusted,"When it comes to choosing an airline, I am sure many would agree with me that the biggest factor in this decision is trust. Trusting the airline to get you to your destination safely. Trusting them to take care of your luggage. Trusting them to provide you with accurate information with anything regarding your travels. I have trusted Delta Airlines for a very long time. I am even a Delta SkyMiles member, as I had planned on being a customer of theirs for a very long time. But I am afraid to say that that trust has reached its demise after today. Today, I flew to Dallas for a business trip that included a golf outing. I was particularly excited about this golf outing, as I had just bought a brand new $300 club that I was very eager to try. However, the club did not come in the mail before I had to ship the rest of my clubs out via a 3rd party service. I immediately called Delta to see if bringing a single golf club onto the plane was possible. I was very doubtful that this would be allowed, but I thought it would be worth making a phone call just to make sure.When I called Delta’s baggage support line, the man who answered the phone told me in complete confidence that it would not be an issue. I even made sure to ask if I would have any trouble getting it through security. He assured me that it would be fine and that I could store the club in the planes closet or just hold it with me in my seat. This information made me very happy and reinforced the high quality of service and excellence that I believed Delta Airlines provided to all their passengers.When I arrived at the airport, I went to check in a bag. While I was at the counter, 3 women were standing there as one of them was checking in my bag. Not one of them noticed the golf club I was carrying and recommended that I checked it in. But why would they? They were probably just as clueless of the rules and regulations as the man I spoke with on the phone. I got to the front of security with 30 minutes until my flight was supposed to leave when one of the officers told me that I was not allowed to bring my club through. I assured him that I spoke with Delta and they said it was ok. It turns out that all sporting equipment must be checked in, no matter how small it may be. I sprinted back to the check in desk to try and check the club in, but it was too late to do so. I even tried to go store it, but the crew was switching shifts and would not be open for another 15 minutes. I did not have 15 minutes. Long story short, I was forced to throw away a brand new $300 golf club because of the false information that I was provided by Deltas clueless support team and the lack of awareness of their check-in team. If I can’t even trust Delta to provide me simple information about the rules and regulations of my travels, how am I supposed to trust them with my safety? It is safe to say that I will never be flying Delta again and I hope that my story will show others that Delta cannot be trusted."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Old plane,For a flight out of the country it was a very outdated plane. Tv in first class about the size of an iPhone.  Service and food was fine
Date of travel: February 2020,50,My Go To Airline,"Personally I prefer Delta above all other airlines. The flight crews are always so friendly and making traveling easier. Delano at the counter for SLC Airport was great, even gave us a 10% off coupon to one of the Airport restaurants since we had a long wait for our flight. Will continue to travel with Delta!"
Date of travel: January 2020,30,Flight,"Flight was okay, a little delay getting into runway. Snacks were lacking and unappetizing. Selections wre not as expected. Attendents seemed to become less polite as flight went on."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Delta is a third rate airline,"If you want poor service, delayed or cancelled flights, non-friendly crew and general disorganization then I highly recommend Delta.  We’ve flown almost every carrier to and from Hawaii and Delta is hands down the worst IMO.  After pushing our 11PM red-eye back to 3:15 AM, they still couldn’t get their act in order and were still on the tarmac at 4AM.  Old aircraft on a long leg was very substandard.  Last time I will ever fly Delta."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great flights,Comfortable seats. Polite and friendly service. Good food service. Good coffee! Very good selection of movies and t.v. shows to watch. Pillow and blanket waiting for everyone at each seat. Ear buds offered to all at no extra charge. Flight turned out to be shorter than expected! Would definitely fly with them again.
Date of travel: January 2020,40,OK,"This was an OK flight. Not great, not bad. about 3 and a half hours over the gulf of Mexico. Delta quite reasonably believe that on a medium flight like this you don't need much. We didn't get it."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,When to fly first class,If you plan to travel with your wife and have a relaxing flight with no hassles of crowed airplanes.    You pay the extra and fly first class      I usually fly delta comfort or first classIt’s worth the money.    On long trips.     Short trips not so much .    Save your money for the long trips.    But delta comfort booked  early.  Reasonable   Is nice
Date of travel: July 2019,50,Excellent customer service,"I’d been flying with Delta Airlines. They are the best airline for me that’s why every time I travel to the Philippines, I choose Delta. Modern aircraft, wide space for your legs, good food and very nice flight attendants."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great direct flight to San Diego from Detroit,Very friendly flight attendants.  Great in flight entertainment in the seatback.  Free texting on WIFI.  I would definitely recommend Delta as an airline.  Landed slightly ahead of schedule.
Date of travel: December 2019,10,"They DON’T love to fly, and it shows",My husband and I had our flights booked in June for our December trip and splurged for first class.  Imagine our surprise when we start board and noticed we were separated and my husband was sitting back in comfort plus and they did not tell us when we checked in.    I questioned it at the gate and was lied to and told the plane was smaller (it wasn’t).   They refused to move me with my husband and the man sitting beside me told me his flight had been booked several months prior as well.   So they obviously double booked our first class seat.   We still haven’t gotten a refund for the price difference but when I have called was assured we had received it.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Sure Slept Well!,"Sleeping in the most comfortable ""pods"" I've been in, really made an extremely long day and a half enjoyable. The food was also delicious. We flew through Paris, where we had a lengthy layover. That was NOT so much fun. But the flights were fabulous."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Delta is Consistent,"I fly Delta often, I find them consistent, courteous, and reliable. I fly 1-2 hour flights mostly. The equipment is good, not always the cleanest, but ok. The service and staff are great."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Surprisingly pleasant with afew hiccups,"Aircraft was modern, seats were comfortable. We were told as a family there is no gaurentee we would be sat together but surprisingly we were (as their policy states no children under 16 is to be separated from their parents). The food is tasty enough. No children menu available- this has to be requested in advance. Although booked through Virgin, the flight was operated by delta and you can only check in 24 hours before departure online. Only small bags were included in the basic economy flight. Any larger suitcases to check in costs an extra £45 return per person. When we flew back from JFK they wanted to charge an additional $57 per suitcase to check in as we needed to provide proof. Apparently none of this information was located on their US system. We managed to show credit card statements so go out of paying for this. The aircrew flying out was ‘off’, seemed that they didn’t want to be there or serve you. The crew flying back was great. Overall good value for money, modern planes and would use again."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Tips for Delta out of Atlanta,I have found that First class is always easy and comfortable on Delta and it helps that its a non-stop flight.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Comforting,"Again, super service with SKY Club, checking in late and taking my worries away in getting my bagged check and me checked in 30 minutes prior to the flight!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Delta makes flying easier,"Delta takes the worry out of traveling. ON time departures, excellent service & fantastic communication allows for this ... thanks you, Delta.Also, through AMEX, visiting the Sky Club (especially in Atlanta) lends for a nice relaxing treat between flights!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Always a great flight,"Delta always provides good service. The Delta pilots always do a superb job, with smooth flights and expert landings. The in-cabin crew are efficient and kind."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"On time departure, early arrival and luggage waiting for us within 15 minutes","Delta is our airline of choice flying from Detroit to Florida.  We often have pre clearance to start our experience in a very positive way.  Staff on board are always friendly.  I can't remember a delayed flight nor a late arrival.  Best of all, luggage always seems to be there before we get to the carousel, less than 15 minutes."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Mexican vacation,"On the way to Mexico, the luggage drop off agent was business-like, but not friendly.The wi-fi didn't work very well as per usual, but everything else was just fine, and as expected.On the return trip, while the luggage drop off agent, Maricruz, was totally wonderful, the  logistics around the flight itself could have been much better. First, we had to wait in the jetway for the pilots to arrive and board. Once they'd passed us and gotten aboard we started moving a bit.  Why had they started boarding before this if we can't enter the plane til then?  The next backup was also in the jetway as there were 2 officers asking us the traditional questions about luggage at the plane end of the jetway, causing a second backup. Why wasn't this done before we entered the jetway? Seemed like no one there had ever learned how to conduct the boarding process....During the flight, the wi-fi was so-so, and the DISH live TV feed was often not available.   Opportunity for improvement of the choices:  carry MSNBC since Fox and CNN are on. (Thanks!)After arriving home, our luggage took 40 minutes to come out. The priority luggage didn't come out until about a half hour into the process, and after 2 other batches of luggage had come through.  Usually our luggage is waiting for us when we get to the carousels. That time can be critical, especially if you're on a connecting flight. That's one of the problems that business and first class flyers count on."
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Rude staff that didn’t seem to take their job seriously. ,"Flew with Delta because it was the cheapest way to get from Orlando to Manchester (UK) but I really wouldn’t choose to fly with them again. Staff lied about there being room for bags in the overhead lockers when there were at least 10 empty. Staff didn’t take the passenger nearby to me seriously who had a severe peanut allergy and they continued to serve peanuts despite being asked multiple times not to because his chest was tightening just from the nearby consumption. The gates were absolute mayhem at Orlando airport - Delta ground staff continuously talking over each other, queues combining with other queues and really unfriendly staff. Really recommend Delta as an airline unless desperate."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Delta Flight 208 From JFK to Edinburgh,"We departed almost two hours late; told they changed aircraft service. Fortunately, one of those late hours was made up with a tailwind. We were surprised that the dinner served was actually tasty; an expectation we long ago gave up on."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Delta Select Premium,"I took Delta Select Premium going to and from the U.S. to Asia, specifically ATL to ICN and ICN to DTW on the return. Highly recommend this class of service. You get early boarding, lots more knee room, better meal service (linens!) and more attention. It is worth the  few hundred $$ extra, still much cheaper than Business. Ok, so you don't get flat bed, but there's enough recline to sleep somewhat comfortably."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Excellent flight,"Excellent service,  professional Minneapolis based crew The flight attendant knew everyone by name + was very good in attending to our comfort"
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Awful,"While I have traveled with Delta for the majority of my trips, I can say I will not again. I recently traveled TDY, and on my trip home my bags were sent to a completely different state and marked as if they were someone else’s bags which caused the issue. The agent at the desk was so focused on getting me to sign up for the Delta airlines card since I was military that she marked my bags incorrectly. After waiting 30 mins for my bags to arrive at the baggage claim I was told there was no bags left. Waiting another 30 minutes to find out the issue, I was told my bags were currently on a flight to Tampa. It was till almost 10 o’clock pm the following day that I was told I could come pick up my bags. The same exactly issue happened to my boyfriend two days prior. No compensation or offers to make anything right. Don’t travel unless your bags are carry’s on."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Terrible service,"I took a multi-city trip with delta, 4 flights total and all of them were delayed, I miss my connections. Very disappointed."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Heathrow to JFK,Probably the best flight I have ever been on. Despite being in basic economy there was plenty of legroom. We were each issued with a programme and menu outlining what to expect throughout the flight and this was kicked off with a peach cocktail. The food was for an airline good and the staff were really nice. We didn’t experience any delays and I would definitely use this airline again.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Below usual standard,In flight entertainment was not operating. Made for a long trip. Kids were screaming most of the way.  Delayed for maintenance issues. Seats were good and service was excellent.
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Bad seats coming back.  Horrible.  Had to sit forward entire time because the row behind us was an exit row.,"Thru expedia could not get seats together. Could not upgrade, horrible seating. Thank goodness I didn't have anyone large next to me.  Barely room to keep in my own seat. They requested we keep our coats in our lap?  Seriously???"
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Los Angeles to Memphis  Delta Airlines,This was a basic flight very old plane so comfort low hostesses were nice plane inside outdated seats uncomfortable This flight delayed 2 hours lucky our driver waited for us alround  very average flight.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Vacation to Paradise,The flight to and from Tampa was good. Both flights had kids that stunk and were loud. I prefer to not be surrounded by kids seeing I don't have any but you can't so it is what it is. The entertainment was great!
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Loved that it was a direct flight,"Loved that it was a direct flight. The outgoing flight was great.  Flight attendants were wonderful, gate personnel were great, return flight however, flight attendants were not in the best of moods. Makes for a tough 5 hour flight."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Good experience in Comfort+,"Solid service from Boston to Orlando and back.  We were able to upgrade to Comfort+ using points so we were able to enjoy the Comfort+ benefits: early boarding, more leg room, and slightly better snacks.  All the seats on the flight had good entertainment (lots of Disney+ movie options) and free messaging via wifi.  The flights were on time and service was rendered as expected.  The plane was clean.  The snacks were good.  Overall we were happy with the flights!"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,The only airline we fly,I love the new reconfiguration of the Boeing 767-400. I like the fact that I can have privacy just by sliding up a partition. Very comfortable and the food and drinks are always delicious.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Come fly the friendly skies!!!,"Great service on Delta. My preferred airline b/c of their overall package. Friendly staff, accommodating and courteous. Highly recommend Delta who is looking to switch to a new airline"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Service delivered as expected,We used Delta for a two leg flight from Toronto to San Juan Porto Rico via Atlanta Georgia and return and found the service met our full expectations. It was basic service but the flight crew were pleasant and looked after us well.   On board entertainment was non-existent  on the leg from Toronto to Atlanta but was available from Atlanta to San Juan.
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Delta lost my gate-checked bag on a 30 min. flight,"I have flown with Delta air lines for over 15 years, for national and international travel. My experience on February 14th was by far the worst experience i have ever had, due to the fact that my gate-checked bag was lost/stolen. According to Delta baggage claim at MDW, my bag was scanned on carousel 3, but never came up on the carousel. I am highly disappointed in the way this matter has been handled on Delta's end from the rep at MDW baggage claim. I unfortunately did not get her name, however she recorded my information on a torn piece of paper and never input the claim into the computer system upon my arrival at MDW and noticing my bag was gone. I had over 10 pairs of clothes and at least 6 pairs of shoes to wear over the all star weekend while I was in Chicago. It is very unfortunate that all of my belongings are gone and I had to shop while in Chicago for things to wear. I had tons of valuables in my suitcase and it is taking me longer than anticipated to make my claim through the Delta claims website becuase I notice something else that is missing from my closet or jewelry bag each day. This experience has made me question Deltas reliability and values."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Awful customer service and time management,Delta's criminal mismanagement of time and resources lead to a flight that was delayed by two hours. This led me to miss my connecting flight through their partner Air France when I landed adding another 5 hours added to the delay. At no point did they try and assist me with making my flight in a reasonable time frame. Awful customer service and abysmal logistics.
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Never seen the way a person was treated by captain and crew ,My son and I was the first Two to board the plane. We sit in the row with 3 seats on the left side. I am watching for the third person to come to sit with us. I see a tall person get on he had on a blue blazer it look almost the same as the staff. I see him talking to the staff he on his cellphone and then he try’s to get the flight attention to take his credit card and was told no and to go to his seat. By know the door to the plane was closed. This tall man walks to where we are sitting and my son ask him are you sitting with us he said yes. We got up so he could get in to the Windo seat. We begin to talk about that I was trying to get the delta app to work on my iPhone to look at the movie playing on this flight. He tell me that he was having trouble with the app to he was going to trie to upgrade his seat he had ask the gate person if they had any first class open she told him yes we do so he explained to me that it’s a little cheaper if you do it when you get on the plane but he was having trouble with the Delta app so he asked the flight attendant to change is card . She told him no for him to go to his seat. He was not happy but he said I not going to worry about it . So my son and I get up to let him get in and we take off . After we get the all clear to use the bathroom he tell us I need to be leet out so we all get up to let him out . He explained that he will be making more trips to the restroom in the 3 1/2 hour flight did we want to change seats that he would be okay with it so we did we put him on the end . He has a beer and we have the best time just talking about life and our kids. Even time a flight attendant walks by his seat they bump in to then they get mad at him for asking them to please open his beer in front of him . He told me I only as that so I know nothing was put in my beer. I told him in to days would you have to be careful . The flight attendant said wow as he put the beer down. The man receiving the beer did not say anything . We get about 20 minutes before we land in Houston and 2 flight attendant and a man walk up to the man and tell him the captain wants to speak with we land and walked off . He looked at me and said did I do anything wrong. I told him not that I seen . We go to Exit the plane The captain is waiting on the walkway going at the airport. The man stopped and said I was told you wanted to speak to me. The cabinets are not going to make a federal case out of this. The man says what are you talking about the captain Replied I want to see your ID. The man asked him what for. The captain said OK you don’t wanna work with me start walking fast at the walkway yelling at the gate Attendant call security call the police I am here now the captain tells the man you stand right here and wait.The man told him I have to go to the restroom the captain replies what you’re going to wet your self He said no sir I’m going to the bathroom I’ll be right back. About that time adult to supervise arrived the captain is telling him his story of what this man supposedly did which was a lie because I pre-boarded the plane I seen everything that happened. I in inform the supervisor that what the captain is saying is not true so the captain says just drop it let it go so at that point. We ask are we being detained are we free to go yes you’re free to go. Along the way into the Houston airport we pass a Houston police officer for some reason you’re being detained again we explain to the officer everything is happened already once. Another officer shows that we explained everything to him also the police off and he’s like what’s the problem the captain can’t come up with one And we explain to the police officer they told us we could go the supervisor Live and said that they never said that but I have it all on  video recording .I’ve never seen a person treated that way by Delta in all my years of flying with them . This captain was trying to get this man in trouble for nothing. I will make it a point not to fly Delta and tell others how bad my trip was
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Wedding,"This flight was truly an extension of our trip abroad. The entire Delta staff were kind, attentive, and very helpful. The food was delicious and after a wonderful trip the previous 2 weeks, we were tired and the flight, food, staff made us feel like we were in 1st class!!!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Nothing négative to say,"Planes on schedule, personnel attentive and helpful, free  meals on board, embedded screens in seats to enjoy movies ( no need of personal tablet), I dis not change m’y mind that Delta is the #1 north American airline company."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Horrible Experience,"My baggage was 6 days late, I landed on the 22nd of December and didn’t get my baggage till the 28th. My Christmas and my Vacation with family was just ruined. I had to book a hotel by the city waiting for my baggage to come only to find out that it’s not coming till after Christmas because of the holiday. When I finally got my baggage, it was cracked and broken. I contacted Delta to try to get some form of compensation only to get emails saying that nothing can be done and because the airline was Tarom Airlines I need to contact them. But at the end of the day, I booked my flight on the Delta website. I paid extra for the baggage insurance and they couldn’t even compensate for that either. It’s just so frustrating because Delta isn’t cheap, and you pay the extra money because of the name Delta has. You expect a better customer service to be provided and just overall a better experience. That’s the only reason I chose them. Instead, I was left in the dust and given no compensation. Just a sorry for the inconsistency and the inconvenience. Just really bad overall experience."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,First class,What an awesome experience. Delta did a first class job getting my wife and me to our favorite destination. Treated very well. Go Delta!
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Very comfortable flight!,"Ordered a vegetarian meal as we didn't want the two other choices(hamburger or curry chicken). Weren't sure what we were going to get but it wound up being a great corn polenta with fruit salad,regular salad, roll and butter! If a meal will be served, check out your choices ahead of time to avoid meals less pleasing. Cabin crew were very professional yet friendly. Great flight! Nice job Delta."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Pleasantly surprised!,The Atlantic flight was excellent. The service outstanding and the price really reasonable.As well all the staff I encountered was very professional.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Quito flight,41/2 to 5 hr flight time. Perfect timing because otherwise we would have had a 8 hr flight. Delta airlines is getting better all the time.
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Rough Flight into Syracuse NY,"A rough flight into Syracuse NY. The winds were rough but the arrival into Syracuse was even worse. When we arrived at our gate after being almost two hours late getting out of Atlanta GA, we could not leave the plane because the gate mechanics failed. After waiting almost an hour, we were informed that the gate could not move. It was frozen. So they had to move the plane to another hopefully working gate. This delay cost us amost another two hour delay before we could get off the plane."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Underpromised and overdelivered!,"Very fast flight to New York City. It was supposed to take 2 hrs, but we actually arrived already after a bit more than an hour. I really liked the economy+ seats, too. It was a great experience once again. Will chose Delta next time as well!"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Liked the food service,"Appreciated leaving and arriving early. Liked all the food, snacks and drinks that  were offered throughout the long flight. One flight attendant was super nice and friendly with everyone. The other flight attendant seemed tired and a bit impatient while serving everyone."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Delta delivery for us!,"Delta delivery for my my family of 5 including me. It was a nice smooth flight, before that, we were able to travel with one backpack and one suitcase. were never one time bothered or ask how heavy was our suitcase. I paid a little extra to seat all together with my daughters but not much. During those 3 hours, we have excellent TLC care: we have drinks first, then dinner, then we had free internet including movies, shows, and TV. All these in front of our seat. The flight attendant provided the ear plugs at no cost. I watched the movie ""La LLorona"" it was pretty amazing. I will absolutely  flight Delta airlines again and again."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Delta Airlines Rocks !,"My husband and I like to travel a couple times a year , the  airline that we love the most is Delta Airlines. Our long flights to Africa and Rome are made bearable because of the service and attitude  of the flight crew . Their attention to making your flying experience a great one is very much appreciated. Bye the way,  the meals and snacks served on the international flights are so delicious and plentiful . I love you Delta !"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,better than driving,Nice and smooth. On time which is always a plus. We did have a small issue with a hurricane but they flew us around it.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Friendly Flyer,Our Flight was great. We arrived on time going to Jamaica and Was ahead to time returning. The staff was friendly and very helpful
Date of travel: February 2020,40,LAARNG,"Flight from NO to Springfield was great.  When I had to rebook, the flight I got was already booked and the only seats available were in first class.  I was able to board first and get settled in.  Flight was uneventful except for slight delays that had me arrive just before midnight."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Delta service has a ways to go,"I flew from Buffalo to Atlantic to connect with my flight to Palm Springs.  I found the customer service to be adequate on my first flight.  However when I got to Atlanta I found unfriendly staff at the gate, and a disorganized boarding where the front of the plane was loaded first creating bottlenecks in the aisle for people in the back of the plane.  Adding to this was the chief flight attendant loudly and gratingly announcing over the speakers for passengers to clear the aisles.  Why not load the back first?"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Round trip Boston to Detroit,"Everything went well.  No delays. Service was good. On time both ways. No issues, or problems. Aircraft was clean."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Delta flight,We were pleasantly surprised at the comfort of the plane and the service from the flight crew. We would use Delta again for future flights
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Weather delays not Delta's fault - they rose to the occasion by keeping passengers well informed.,Flight was uneventful despite the weather.  They made up time on the northbound flight so we weren't as late as otherwise might have been.  Crew excellent as usual.
Date of travel: February 2020,20,In Flight Porn??,"The boarding process was insane.  Like a black Friday crowd waiting for Walmart to open.  Gate attendant stopped a child with a service dog after his family had gone down the jetway and made him panic.  the poor kid couldn't understand the gate agents accent.  Once we were in flight, the in flight entertainment gave the option of asian soft porn, which my neighbor gladly enjoyed.  Twice.  The lavatory smelled of vomit and the flight attendants seemed to be very put out by getting anyone beverages.  Especially when they forgot to give the lady across from me her water and was asked for it again.  This was a disappointing flight in general but the whole porn thing was nauseating."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Flight to Raleigh - Not bad,The original flight home was delayed 5 hours and I was lucky enough to get the last seat on an earlier flight. I got home only 2 hours later than I originally was expecting.
Date of travel: February 2020,30,LHR-ATL Delta Comfort+ Daytime Flight,"Comfort + seat 32C on a Boeing 767-400 daytime flight with 11:00UK depart and 16:00 USA arrival. Comfort + gets you priority boarding, dedicated overhead bin, extra legroom (3-4"") and 50% more recline. Don't be fooled as despite the premium price this is NOT Premium Economy.Seat was just good enough for a 9+ hour flight with 17.9"" width (same as economy) and extra legroom of 35"" compared to 31-32 economy.  IFE was good and the selection more than adequate for the most discerning of Film or Series viewers. FAs were efficient and the drinks okay, food selection very good.Try and avoid economy seats B, E and F as these have the IFE boxes under and that restricts legroom.  The 767 is showing its age compared to the new Dreamliner and A350s and that would be reason enough to be selective on which flight to choose.Overall better than some (BA!!) but not good enough to justify the Comfort+ premium pricing. Comfort+ is marketed so that Premium Economy searches will show these seats (Kayak and Skyscanner don't recognise the difference) when they really are a long way from such and are more akin to standard economy with more legroom and a drink.  I took a return flight with Virgin Atlantic in Premium Economy and the seat difference is huge, be careful when booking!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Delta Flight,Been flying with Delta for several years consistently now. Many flight options available. And good rates depending on origin / destination. advance purchase will also save money.
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Another crappy flight,"The return journey - another terrible flight with Delta.  Cramped seats. 1 glass of water and a granola bar.  Flight departure delayed by nearly 2 hours for a computer problem that needed fixing before our oceanic flight great that they got it fixed and we were good to go, but the delays had serious knock on effects for passengers with booked close connections.  Knowing our flight had arrived and we were expediting our passengers of the plane to make their Delta connections - the flights departed without the passengers.  One flight left over 50 passengers behind - all needing to be rebooked.  These flights were only marginally better than Ryan Air!  Not impressed for the prices paid for these flights!"
Date of travel: February 2020,10,What a flight,"We were booked with Virgin from LHR to LAX in Premium Economy.  The service and seating were fabulous.  LAX to OGG was booked as a co share with Delta and Oh my goodness what a contrast.  Cabin crew - there was on chap who was absolutely lovely - friendly, chatty and generally attentive, sadly the rest were complete polar opposites.  The seating was so uncomfortable and very narrow.  On a planned 6 hr flight we were given a few beverages and a couple of snacks. They were nice snacks, don’t get me wrong but a proper brunch would have been nicer.  Overall will never fly Delta again - our experience was not what I would call Comfort+.  Not even comfort"
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Totally deltas fault - no pilots for flight ,I am diamond medallion with delta and have always bragged about their service ...until 2/13/2020 !  I have to fly from Gsp to phl to pick up my 6 yr old grand daughter and fly her directly back to Charlotte for visitation reasons.  I allow at least 3hrs in between flights. I have done this many many times with no problem  on feb 13 my first flight was delayed due to no pilots available on delta which delayed 2 1/2 hrs causing me to miss my connection from Atlanta to Philly.  Therefore missing my 5 pm  American flight to Charlotte. I lost 558 dollars because we couldn’t make it.  On top of that we had to be rebooked with delta (was not American Airlines fault) to Raleigh 3 hrs from our original destination   Delta charged me 43000 miles to book my grand daughters flight and 278 dollars to book my flight.  Then we had to get rental Car in Raleigh and drive the 3 hrs   It was totally deltas fault.  Not weather not mechanical but no pilots!!!   It is early enough in the year for me to switch to another airline to make loyalty status.  I am soooo disappointed !!!
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Delta is the best,"Flying United, the worst airline in the world, always reminds me of how amazing Delta is. I love Delta. They clearly value employees who are human, smart, and kind, and their customer service genuinely reflects that. They are real people helping real people. Thank you, Delta!"
Date of travel: September 2019,20,First Class Rip-off,"Departing from JFK on an international flight so got to the airport couple of hours early and checked in.  Had plenty of time so went to first class lounge for some coffee.  Would you believe that we were denied admittance to lounge because, even though flying first class, lounge was only for ""international first class"".  When I pointed out that destination was Vancouver, I was informed that Delta does not consider Canada and Mexico international!!  (By the way, same stupid rationale on return from Calgary.)  Somehow, when accepting our substantial fare for these tickets, Delta's people never mentioned their unique definition of ""international"".Well, Delta, you saved the cost of two cups of coffee but you can take me off your ""satisfied customer"" list.  Even better, take me off your customer list as well."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Direct to and From Cancun,"This is a non-stop from Indianapolis to Cancun.  There is now a website to fill out your Mexican tourist form which makes entering Mexico so much easier.  If you are entering Mexico Friday, Saturday, or Sunday, expect long lines at Immigration."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Much better than the rest.,"Like all flights these days, it was fully booked. Like all flights, people bring too many carry-on bags that make boarding difficult. After everyone was seated, everything went smoothly and the staff was very helpful. And we took off right on time."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Wonderful in every way,"If a 16 hour flight can be perfect, then this was it.  We booked premium economy and it was worth every cent for space, service, a little better food, and especially roominess of the seat.  The plane was on time and even a little early.  Lots of good movies to pass the time.  Best of all was the terrific service we received from the crew (a big shout out to Sherry and Paula who have been flying together for 25 years!). They helped a sick friend who was unable to board, and then they carefully attended to us and everyone else with grace and good humor— not easy on a flight this long.  We arrived not too worse for the wear.  I flew Qatar just 3 weeks before and Delta its you hands down!  Thanks for everything!"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,"Good, problemfree flight","Flew from Tampa to JFK as part of a Virgin booking, in Tampa's Premium Economy equivalent.  Boarding was good as were the seats and leg room.  The plane was clean and the crew friendly and efficient.  We left on time and landed on time.  Have  flown with Delta before and this flight was quite up to their standards."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Delta is my go to airline,"Being a Delta Platinum Medallion flyer helped, but I didn't anticipate the entire family being upgraded to first class on an international flight. Delta came through in flying colors."
Date of travel: January 2020,30,Just So So....,"The best thing about the flight was the flight crew/flight attendants. They did a first class job, great service and attention throughout the flight. The food was also very good. Entertainment was so so.We had heard a lot about the new Delta One service on Delta Airlines and were very much looking forward to being able to fully recline for sleeping during the 12 hour flight. Unfortunately the new seating was a disappointment. The cubbyholes that made up each seat felt cramped. The seats seemed hard and were not comfortable and the full recline was very disappointing. They did fully recline but it was very cramped. My feet were pinched and just never could find a comfortable position. While the seats have new features that make them attractive the sacrifices in comfort to accommodate the new features are not a good trade. Its obvious that Delta spent a lot of money in an effort to make improvements but their efforts I am afraid missed the mark. You would think that if your goal is to afford passengers the option to sleep laying down, then you would be absolutely certain that you are providing them with something comfortable to sleep on. Just to be fair, it may just have been me. I did see many of the other passengers sleeping, maybe I am just too use to my own bed."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,On time and attendants were absolutely wonderful!,"Wonderful flight we took off on time. Was a little concern about the snow and ice due to the incident that happen the day before my scheduled flight. All ended well and upon arriving in Kansas City, it was blue skies and very cold. No snow!!"
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Passengers are treated like mushrooms,This flight had mechanical problems that caused a delayed of about 2 hours. All the passengers were asked to deplane and all those with connecting flights were rebooked with no hotel or meal vouchers and multiple passengers having to stay overnight at Minneapolis. Then the passengers were asked to re-board the plane and then came another long delay of waiting for nearly 2 hours with no information . This airline crew treats its passengers like mushrooms keeping them in the dark even with delays on nearly 4 hours and missing connections . Terrible customer service !
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Short flight but excellent service,"Short flight from a very small airport to one of the busiest.  No problems leaving with no need for 2 hour arrival time.  However, for one who walks as slowly as I would have been better off to ask for a wheelchair as my trip to baggage had its ups and downs, tram ride, up an escalator, down an escalator, long walk to the baggage area and my bag was locked up by the time I arrived there.  On the return I had a wheelchair ride and it was a great improvement."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"Had my first class upgrade , Atl to MSP","As a million mile flier, I’ve seen it all the past 20 yrs. delta always in the lead. Helpful flight attendants, planes always clean. It’s a domestic cut above"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,"Great Experience, friendly attendants!",Great experience overal from the ticket counter all the way to the plane. Attendants are always friendly. Flights were smooth and on time.. actualy early for most of the trip! I fly with Delta most often and every time so far have had a great experience.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,On time and friendly service,The Comfort Plus class of service was wonderful.  Flight Attendants were friendly and helpful.  Flights were on time.  Planes were a little old and some movie selections didn't work.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"Safe flight, on time, great crew",Uneventful and safe. What more can one ask for? The flight crews were efficient and professional. Planes were clean. Snacks are good.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Love Delta Airlines,I always try to book my flights with Delta. They have decent sized seating for economy and meals aren't bad. Overseas flights are especially nice because all gratuities are included.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,great customer service; delays due to weather,more legroom than other airlines; flights delayed dueto weather but kept us informed adn gave us free snacks. Some baggage had to be moved due to people not following rules but overall great experience adn staff very pleasant and helpful.
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Easy flight,"I was a nice, easy flight. The planes have shrunk and the seating is crowded. There wasn't much difference between first class and economy."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Flight to New York 2012,Our flight from New Orleans Airport to New York was excellent. We did have a problem with the ground crew as we went to out side to check in and the attendant was very busy (he was working by himself) trying to get the luggage for a band checked in. He did finish that but instead of helping us he left the counter and brought the luggage to the loading belt. When he was leaving I told him we were running very close to our pre-boarding time and he told us to go inside to check in. He was rude and we did check inside the terminal where a Delta employee was so very helpful and professional. We got to our gate and the passengers  were on it and we got on the plane because they knew we checked in so they held the plane up and we got on and we took off on time. We always fly Delta to New York as we can get the flioght times we want and the flights are direct.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Christmas in Hawaii,"Delta airlines staff were courteous and empathetic. When my eleven year old got on board feeling rather sleepy and tired, the crew did everything to help her get her carryon on to the overhead storage, gave her a blanket right away and told her she was welcome to fall asleep as soon as the plane took off. Regardless of the fact that our daughter knew these things the crew member took the time to comfort na d reassure her. See you in the sky! Thanks for your hospitality"
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Flight our was wonderful. Desk agent on return spoiled the overall great experience.,"I fly a fair amount, not a mega miler, but at least monthly. This is the first time I have flown with Delta. The folks make the difference, and with the exception of the guy at the gate in Dallas, who was particularly rude and condescending. After a very short exchange with him, I sat down and let it go. BUT I could'nt so I walked up to him to see his name tag and he made a inappropriate comment about me to a coworker. I guess he didnt see my wife sitting nearby who heard what he said. I did not speak rudely, raise my voice or act disrespectfully in any manner. He did. If he was one of my employees he would have been disiplined.That being said, the rest of the folks were great. Happy, friendly and polite. Just as I am and want to be treated. One bad apple sure can spoil the whole barrel."
Date of travel: January 2020,30,I paid for Main (Select my seat) and was moved randomly (3 separate times),"I really do think Delta is a great airlines.  The service and in-flight amenities are very nice.  However, their passenger processing is lacking substantially.  On 3 separate occasions, I booked independently with a friend who booked independently as well.  We both PAID A PREMIUM to allow us to select our seats and choose to fly seated together.  In 3 separate instances a random seat change to either one or both of us occurred, to accommodate other parties that booked together (most likely less far enough in advance to afford seat availability needed for the whole party of travelers).  When my friend and I book together on the same reservation, we have never been split.  Yet, when we book independently, we are almost always split.  My thought is that since we APPEAR TO BE single passengers, Delta assumes it is acceptable to change our seats.  Why?  I could simply book a less expensive Basic Economy ticket and  then be understandably randomly seated. At least the inconvenience is less expensive.  This practice of re-assigning a person's premium reservation seat is so fraudulent!  If you PAY to pick a seat, then that seat should be honored. Why is it OK for Delta to inconvenience a single passenger reservation to meet the needs of anyone else if the single passenger paid for select seating privilege (I am not speaking with respect to meeting passengers with special needs; this was obviously not the case in my experiences).What should be a 5 star review is tainted by this PATTERN of behavior by Delta Airlines."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,January 2020 flight,Flew out of Los Angeles.  A bit of confusion if terminal 2 or terminal 3 since international.  Called Delta and they could not clarify.  Several months earlier traveled the same route and had gotten an email to check bags in terminal 2 but then walkor take their shuttle to terminal 3 for departure.  Since this time no email or phone clarification went straight to terminal 3 and it worked out fine.  Flight was on time both departing and returning.  Return flight was early arrival back to Los Angeles.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Loving Delta,The plane for my flight from Columbus was late getting to Columbus and subsequently was late getting into Detroit. I missed the connection in Detroit by a few minutes as I had to get from one corner of the B concourse to the opposite corner of the A concourse in about 5 minutes. I failed. The ladies at the help desk were very accommodating and put me on the next available flight thankfully. I enjoyed a leisurely lunch in the Detroit airport and a super smooth flight to Boston with a surprise upgrade.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Staff was Incredibly Pleasant,"Our flight was delayed a bit but once we were on the plane, it was a great experience. The flight attendants were excellent and the seats were comfortable."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Hassle free flight,"Although we had a gate change, it was only over one gate. The flight was on time. Flight attendants were very nice. Great selection movies and other viewing options. We arrived 20 minutes early. Great flight! The return flight was equally as good leaving on time and arriving about 5 minutes early. I fly Delta most of the time and have been very happy with their service."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,NICE AND EFFECTIVE,Crews were very nice and professional.  seats were very avg and legroom was lacking.but it was clean and very nice
Date of travel: February 2020,50,On time.  Smooth.  Consistent.,"I am a product of the Delta/NW merger.  I got my million miles shortly after the merger was completed.  Because of this and the fact that Delta owns MSP, i pretty much exclusively fly Delta.But, I do it because they are consistent.  Sure, not all employees are great, but I would say they are above average (based on conversations with friends flying other airlines).  Comfort + is what I remember Coach Class being when I was a kid.  Do I fault Delta for that?  No, we are to blame.  We wanted a Greyhound in the sky, and we got it by not agreeing to pay higher fares.  So now I pay a higher fare to get some leg room.  If i was a little smaller I would fly Economy.So, if you are looking for a limo ride and pampering, don't fly.  Not Delta, not American, not United. If you want a solid, consistent experience that is not overly frustrating, fly Delta."
Date of travel: January 2020,30,Good experience,"Food was good, space was tight, and customer service was sometimes curt.  Flight from Seoul to Hanoi, following our flight from RDU to Seoull was with Korean Air.  What an incredible difference.  Korean is an excellent 10 compared to Delta's 5."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Fly Delta frequently,I fly Delta Airlines frequently and always find my experience excellent. The flight attendants are always attentive and it's amazing that  they are in such good humor considering the number of passengers they need to take care of. It is unusual for the airline not to communicate with me about delays. We often land early rather than late. My recent flight from San Francisco to Detroit was comfortable and on time.  I usually do work on these flights and use go-go Internet. The Internet connections are usually good even though I find the service a bit expensive.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Delta Airlines--a pleasant surprise,"Every day people complain about the lack of customer service in the airline industry but Delta really went above our expectations. As soon as we arrived at the Delta check-in Panama City, we were met by friendly and courteous staff. It was an early morning flight and from there, until boarding, everything was easier than normal while traveling through American Customs. On the flight, the crew was a delight, and wait for it, the free meal was delicious. I chose a complimentary cheese tray, and we were constantly served drinks and snacks. It was a pleasure cruise. Thumbs up to the crew and airline"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,The Delta Difference,"I have flown a lot of airlines.  No one compares to Delta.  Their cabin crews are amazing.  Generous, helpful, compassionate and always available.  Aircraft was a 777.   Seats and bathrooms were spotless and kept that way.  Totally enjoyed both flights and the brief connection in LAX.  LAX though could sure use some better signage!"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Tampa Fl to Sydney Australia is a long flight!,"We flew both to and from on Delta and cannot complain about the service, the food or the flights.  It is a 13 and 1/2 hr flight  just to LAX from Sydney and another 5 hr one on to Tampa. We have flown 1st class to Europe twice, and since my husband can't lie all the way down because his shoulders are too wide, we decide to try Comfort One + for this trip. The problem with that is that the amount of space given for your feet to be raised is fine if you wear a size 7 shoe, but an 11 one doesn't fit comfortably at all.  He ended up not even using the foot rest.  I did but I'm only 5'2""!"
Date of travel: February 2020,20,First Class Not Worth The Cost,"I am an Elite member on another airline, but wanted to try Delta because it serves many of the key cities I need to visit on a regular basis.  I flew from SEA to SJC in First Class, but want impressed.  The staff was nice, but their was no designated attendant for our seating zone.  The first round of drinks were in plastic cups and the only food we were offered could have been purchased from a gas station’s mini-mart.   So I recommend travelers to save their money and just fly comfort or economy; or if you prefer excellent first class service then fly another airline."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Consistently good,"We were able to upgrade this flight to First Class using our air miles. Delta consistently does a good job of being on time, and providing friendly service. This flight was no different other than we had comfortable seats."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,"good flight,no extras","No issues, but very basic. 5 hour flight, no meal. I guess this is sadly the standard no,unless you travel internationally. I always thought that if a flight was more than 4 hours a meal was included."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Very helpful.,"I'll have to say, another great flight with Delta to New York.   Check in counter people were so helpful.  In LAX, I accidentally booked my sister's ticket under my last name instead of her married name.   They were so helpful and fixed the situation.   Flight attendants were great.   Flight on time.      Returning home, my sister had lost her wallet and they were very helpful getting us thru TSA (who were rude and a**holes).  Flight attendants weren't as friendly as the LAX crew (they seemed a lot younger, not as good with service).   Flight had to wait about 20 minutes for an available gate at LAX due to a previous flight with mechanical problems, but the captain kept us updated."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,"Safe, On Time, No Frills","Safe, on time departure and arrival but basic cabin service which cannot in any measure compare to most Asian or Middle Eastern airlines. So if you seek good meals, top class amenities and being pampered by the cabin crew, you had better choose some other airline"
Date of travel: August 2019,40,Good crew,"Everything was good. From booking my flight on line to the timelines of the flights. Not thrilled to pay for a checked bag, but that’s the way most airlines do it. All of my flights departed and arrived on time."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"Flight to LA awesome, to Hawaii - not so much","Brand new plane from NO to LA, more leg room and the entertainment system was on point! The flight from LA to Honolulu was ugh! I was told it's because there isn't much money in the flight from LA to Hawaii because most people use their miles so they use the older planes. I definitely found that to be true on my trip. The entertainment systems were spotty, most didn't work. I borrowed my husband's to watch a movie, ridiculous! Not as much leg room either."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,"Lukewarm Water, really???","My experience flying from Atlanta to Baltimore on Delta airlines was horrible! I paid extra for the comfort plus and all I got for that whole trip was one cup of lukewarm water. It wasn't even cold water! I realize I wasn't sitting in 1st class, but it was really difficult to sit there and drink my lukewarm water while the flight attendant in 1st class was serving them constantly!  At the end of the flight they had the nerve to ask us to take out our own trash.  I left mine. For one thing, the person that sat in my seat before me had left their own trash behind and nobody had bothered to pick it up before they boarded us. Clearly that person was served way more than lukewarm water. They were obviously served snacks and womine, which is what I kind of expected to receive myself. I did not expect lukewarm water. I will never fly Delta again!"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Return flight was delayed 25 minutes.  Made up time on the flight back.,Typical flight with no problems.  Seat entertainment helps the time pass.  Delta is always better than the economy lines.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,No problems in Business Class,"Recently remodeled 767 and everything worked.  Lay flat seat adequate enough. Didn't sample the Cerviche or Cheeseburger offered after a dinner in Lima and anyway a 1AM flight sleep is more important.  The flight we took was delayed to 1:15AM take off.  I have never seen a 767 boarded as fast.  Apparently if they didn't pull away from the gate by a certain time they would have had to wait several hours to leave.  But whatever, we arrived early in Atlanta, our bags waiting for us off the carousel after we cleared immigration with our Global Entry. Seamlessly onto our final destination of Minneapolis.   My wife required wheelchair assistance still recovering from a bad fall this past November.  It was promptly furnished in both Lima and Atlanta by Delta. By the way, the Lima airport is a madhouse with vast distances between  the check in counter and the gates and airline lounges.. Get there 3 hours in advance even if flying business class."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Comfort Plus Seats are worth it!,We upgraded to Comfort Plus and just that little bit of extra leg room was so nice!  The food service for this flight - approximately 6 hours is nothing but snacks and drinks.  Oh how I miss the good ole days!  The movie selection is quite good and I had no problems with my screen but my husband's would not turn off on the red eye flight and that was annoying.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,One of the best flights we have ever taken ...,"From the lounge, through Checkin, Security, boarding to the actual flight to Salt Lake City (and on to Palm Springs), this was up there with the best.  Excellent flight, arrived early, good instructions for our connecting flight all made a difference along with great movie choices, good seat area and good food.  The thing that really stood out for us were the cabin crew - they were outstanding from start to finish.  For Pat and her team (I think Erin or Erica? Who served us), nothing was too much trouble yet they managed to be unobtrusive at The same time.  So different from many other flights where the crew seem to find passengers an inconvenience.  They really seem to enjoy their roles and should be congratulated for outstanding customer service."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Airline boarding process,I am so disappointed with the delta air boarding process.  With so many different zoning one gets boarded at different times.  You may be in front seating and by the time you get boarded the luggage rake gets filled in by other passengers.  This is so unfair that the rake above your seating is already full when you get seated.  Delta needs to address this situation.  Otherwise it is a good airline to fly internationally.
Date of travel: February 2020,10,"Lies, Mechanical Issues, and More Lies","Tried to fly out of Grand Rapids on Feb. 13th to MSP and then to YYC.  Upon checking in, we were told our flight was delayed.  I asked if the flight was in-bound and the ticket agent assured us it was.  We then entered security.  3 hours later, we find out the plane was just leaving MSP and we had been lied to!  Needless to say, we missed out connection and were delayed by almost 24 hours for our ski vacation.  Fast forward to Friday, Feb. 14th in the morning, we check out Baggage Tracker for all 3 of us and it had different information, so we called Delta, waited 40 minutes to speak to someone and they assured us that one bag was in Winnipeg on the way to Calgary at 8:45AM and the other 2 bags were already in Calgary (which caused me to question how this could happen, when we missed the last filght.) I was told it was ""Expedited""  Our fights were not to Edmonton and then to YYC. Upon arriving at Edmonton and having a nice talk with security, they suggested I check baggage for our luggage, since it was illegal for delta to forward luggage internationally without us.  I could not believe it.  ALL 3 BAGS arrived in Edmonton....I'm really glad security was so great, because we were ready to jump on the next connection to YYC, since our luggage was ""Already There..""  Another Great DELTA LIE!!!  I asked how to get compensated for our 3 pre-paid lift tickets, and our room and was told just send delta a note and they will make it right.  Well, so much for this.  I Haven't received any communication regarding righting the  wrong.  I wish we had an easier way of dealing with airlines, expecially when they post record earnings...."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Had gluten free snacks,I was so happy that Delta offers gluten free snacks- Kind bars and GF almonds.  Usually I have to take my own. Nice surprise
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Great Flight experience,I recently flew Delta on a Regional Jet from Tampa to Raleigh.  It was an early morning flight.  The Gate staff were friendly and helpful.  We boarded on time and loaded the full flight. The only downside was This jet had smaller storage bins than normal so most wheeled bags had to be gate checked.  The seats in Comfort+ were nice as was the extra legroom.  Flight arrived early and off to work I went.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,nice experience,"The service offered was good, we even got special meals (GF and veg).The food quality is not very good, but as for every airline.Entertainment videos are good, teh seats are ok.The tray table was dirty when I unfolded it, that meansd that cleaness was superficial in between flights.The airhostess were in Y class were not always very kind but in general all was good."
Date of travel: January 2020,30,As expected,"Generally good. A bit of a weather related delay on flight home but better to be safe than sorry. One leg of flight 2-3hrs had no entertainment available,bummer. Crews on flights were professional and attempted to be friendly. Baggage policy sucks as well as seat selection,boarding and change of plans. Overall class average for domestic airlines. Oh, and cost was a bit higher than competitors too."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Flight 648 SLC to DFW always works for me!,"This flight is very convenient timing-wise, and the Airbus 200 is a very comfortable aircraft. Lunch selection vary, but are usually good. I had the Ham Sandwich, which turned out to be a heated entrée and tasted nice."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,"Clean, friendly staff, on time","Excellent airline.  Staff was friendly and professional, plane was clean, flights on time.Very satisfied."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Love the friendly and respectful flight attendants.,"Delta is doing a great job prioritizing customer service. These days, many flight attendants are entitled, rude and short, as if they know you're trapped on the plane and nothing they do matters. But Delta flight attendants make an effort to be friendly, personable and respectful to customers, even though I know their bigger purpose is passenger safety. They're still the face of the airline and it is important they are welcoming and kind."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Way better than Frontier!,"Even though this was a low-cost seat for me on Delta, there was no problem with the carry-on bag. The people working at Delta from the check in to the gate and on the plane itself were all really nice and super friendly."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Flying through the storm,"Our roundtrip flights departed and arrived on time, despite a bumpy ride on all legs, due to stormy weather.  The cockpit crew was terrific, and even pleasant.  The only 'problem' was that the stewards were asked to suspend beverage service because of the rowdy weather, but as problems go, it was no big deal."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Freezing in Flight,"Love to travel! This wasn’t the best flight. Very cold on the plane. Several passengers in economy asked for throws/blankets. We were told there weren’t any available. First Class passengers had 2 throws/blankets each. Delta should plan accordingly. This isn’t a reflection of the Pilot’s skills~excellent take off, landing... #feltlikealowerdecktitanicpassenger"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Superb experience!!!,Delta always makes one feel very special and part of the family.  We flew from HNL to ATL on a redeye and were treated like royalty.  Will definitely fly again!!!
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Cayman flight,Both ends of the trip we’re phenomenal. Staff was exceptional.  We didn’t experience any problems. Flights left and arrived on time on both ends.
Date of travel: February 2020,10,See a down-word trend,"I have been a loyal customer of Delta.  But this flight was a nightmare.  My friends and I flew to Cozumel.  I knew that it would be pretty awful because it was a cheap red eye.  However, the flight attendants from SLC to Atlanta were really nasty and abrupt.  You can;t tell them that on the flight because they would probably push you out the door at the end. They were not helpful.I was previously on a Delta flight in November from Paris to JFK.  The same thing was true and on this flight the plane was downright dirty.  I am sad.  I liked Delta and since I live in SLC it is easy to get a flight but I am going to lose a little of my loyalty for nicer treatment and a clean environment.One specific example:  we were in the back of the plane so we were last for service.  My friend asked for the full can of Diet Coke.  The flight attendant made a snotty remark and so I asked for the full can too.  She did not give me a cup or any ice and was really snotty.  It is not like we were making them short of refreshments!  I did not ask for a snack as I would probably get a paper cut from her throwing it at me."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Overall good flights,Overall good roundtrip flights. Couldnt get drinks on return flight due to turbulence. Flight attendants were friendly and courteous on flights
Date of travel: June 2019,10,Mileage being Stolen,"So we've been a Delta Skymiles member for decades and have miles gained from both International and Domestic flights. I was planning on using them for Hotel or something and was just informed after a 40 minute hold that I am unable to use them unless I purchase their expensive Delta American Express Credit Card. Wow - so basically they are taking your miles and holding them hostage until you purchase their Credit card with an Annual Fee that you Don't need. They don't seem to mind if you Purchase the tickets with any other card - funny how that works right? I have a couple Domestic vacations and an International trip planned this year and will no longer fly this airline. Overseas trips are better on foreign airlines anyway - better service, prices, and amenities. Even the Delta agent agreed she disagreed with this. so much for Customer service - reconsider this corporate american airline. So much for all those tax breaks dripping down to the middle and lower classes."
Date of travel: February 2020,20,The benefits are few - for $300 go business,"Normally I fly Delta Comfort. I pay a few extra dollars to board early and it was a small price. Premium Select just rolled out on international flights and is between business and comfort so I decided to give it a try. Unlike comfort when you pay a couple hundred dollars more this service was over $1k difference. In fact some flights I viewed the difference between premium select and business as only a few hundred dollars. The seats are bigger but the footrests are useless. The tv screens and on board entertainment is more movies, more channels. I was disappointed. I was able to go in priority security line at JFK but not eligible for Delta Lounge. Premium had it’s own cabin with 2 seat configuration (6 per row). They gave the same toilets kits but a better set of headphones. Same cheap blankets and pillows. I don’t see the value. Save your money and go with comfort or spend the extra few hundred and fly business and get a bed, lounge privélevens, security priority."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Safe flight,"I fly this particular route ALOT and I have no idea why this time the trip was longer, especially with decent weather and no delays! I love the snacks, but the flight attendants were not that friendly. I also HATE that earplugs are no longer free!! I would rather watch movies during a 5.5 hour flight than eat snacks. Even though I appreciate the snacks, charging me for flimsy earplugs sucks. The seats are decent and the other passengers weren’t as irritating on this flight as others! The landing was very rough, but both pilots stayed until everyone deplaned to say have a good day and thanks, I loved that and truly appreciate them for getting me home safe!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Amazing overall,"Pros:* Flight attendants were friendly and cheerful* Food and drinks were very tasty and frequently offered* Lay flat seat is comfortable and perfect for catching some Zs* Delta One private suite is very nice for resting and relaxing on long-haul from TokyoCons:* Minor issue: my suite door would not close; however, my wife’s door worked fine* Moderate issue: IFE was not working properly: passengers could only choose a small selection of Disney/Marvel movies (approximately 20 total) and main cabin reportedly had no sound whatsoever; this made for a somewhat boring flight since many passengers pass the time watching movies during long-haul flightsSummary:* Delta One suite on B777 from HND-MSP: Service and suite were top-notch. I look forward to flying Delta One long-haul again - hopefully with fully functioning IFE!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,My advice:  Fly Delta!,"The departure and arrival, USA to Mexico and Mexico to USA   Both trips on time, no delays.   The service personnel were very pleasant, polite.  At least 40 popular movies offered in the comfort of your own seat.   The beverages and snacks were fresh.  Boarding and disembarking all very organized, managed quite well.  A pleasant ride!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Saftey First,"I hadn't traveled on Delta for sometime. I typically use American or Southwest. I was impressed with Delta overall. Planes were nice. The seats in Economy were decent. I liked the in-flight entertainment and info system. And the staff were pleasant and accommodating. There are a very limited number of flights across all airlines going in and out of Cozumel daily. Our flight on Delta leaving Cozumel to Atlanta was supposed to leave at 2:50pm. About 45 minutes before then it was announced that there was a maintenance issue and the flight was delayed until 5:00pm. As time went on, the departure time kept getting pushed back further and further. It was finally announced that the plane could not be repaired within a reasonable amount of time and that a replacement plane was being flown from Atlanta to Cozumel specially to pick us up. Due to the long wait, Delta had all us passengers picked up at the Cozumel airport and taken over to an all-inclusive resort for food and free drinks for several hours. We greatly appreciated that as it really helped the wait time go by. Long story short, we did not get into Atlanta until after 1am. Most everyone onboard the flight missed their connecting flights, including me and my party. Delta had staff waiting on us in Atlanta to answer questions and rebooked flights. They paid for everyone who needed it a room at a hotel at the airport since many connecting flights were hours away. They put me and my party up at a new trendy (and I'm sure expensive) hotel at no charge. We opted to take an 11:30am flight on to Nashville then that morning. That gave us plenty of time to get some good rest.In summary, Delta did everything that they could under the circumstances without sacrificing our safety and while also addressing the needs and comfort of it's passengers. I truly appreciated that."
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Flight Delay,"We were returning home from a vacation.  We were due to land in Minneapolis around 9:30 PM but because of a broken part, we were delayed and did not take off until around 10:00 PM arriving home a little after 1:30 AM.  Unfortunately, maintenance in Fort Lauderdale did not have a replacement part so we had to wait for an arriving flight from Detroit which ultimately flew us home.  Luckily, the plane was the same configuration as our original plane so reticketing was not necessary.  The crew did an excellent job under the circumstances."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Top Notch,All of the crew and Delta workers were amazing and had no idea who was in what class before we boarded the plane. There was kindness to each person who interacted with the Delta staff! Even the people who didn't have assigned seats were treated graciously and respectfully.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Great Flight - Horrible Check-In Process,"Flight itself was fantastic.  Excellent service from the hot towel before dinner, to the light breakfast.  Plane was in good condition. But the check-in process at the Santiago, Chile airport was terrible.  Everyone arrived 3 hours early, so really long lines with no line control.  People were cutting the line and defying the other people who called them out on it.  There were not enough employees to check passengers in, weigh luggage and create luggage tags (the kiosks did not create luggage tags).  We've flown all over the world and never had this bad of check-in. Would have rated the experience ""excellent"" if check-in was better."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Winter vacation to Costa Rica,Our flights both going to Liberia and returning to Nashville could not have gone more smoothly.  Each of the legs left on time and several arrived early at the various destinations.  The staff on the flights was excellent.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,A Very Nice  TransAtlantic Flight    Nice Crew,"We flew last week from the states to London.   There is a new  sort of  menu-plan which is very nice  -   more options.  And there was a  starter cocktail  - part of the menu.  I am sure this makes more work for the flight crew,  but they were very attentive and  friendly.  I would recommend flying on Delta."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Generous seats in economy,"Nice entertainment center was free on seat back, seats were generous, extra bathroom mid-plane, captain kept us informed of turbulence"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,"Finally, an A350 experience!","I've flown Delta Airlines across the Atlantic many times, but I'd never had the good fortune of flying on their new A350. I'm a huge aviation buff, and I've wanted to get on board this aircraft. The plane is often compared to Boeing's Dreamliner, and I can see some similarities. Overall, though, the Dreamliner is the superior experience, in my opinion. Still, I enjoyed Delta's A350. It was comfortable and the economy product on Delta has improved significantly in recent years. The meal I had in coach was probably the best coach meal I've ever had on an airplane. It was delicious! And I heard other passengers around me commenting in agreement. The one drawback was the flight attendants assigned to my section of the plane. They acted like they had a dozen other places they'd rather be. They were checked-out and seemed put out to serve passengers. But overall, I still trust and enjoy Delta, and this fllight allowed me to check off another aircraft type from my list."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Delta is good most times,Delta is usually our go to airline and they reward us with good service and flights on time.  The may have just dropped the ball this time. Our return trip from Zurich to Atlanta was rerouted to Amsterdam and we had to make another connection to get home to Jackson. At first they had wanted to route us through New York and back home 8 hours late for trip from Atlanta to Jackson. We both had wheelchairs and the attends were great. However Delta did forget my husband's salt free meal when they rerouted us. Plane was comfortable and service was good. Flight attended tried very hard to put something together for my husband to eat.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Dependable,"This is one of the best routes to get to Europe from the midwest. You can travel in the afternoon and get to Amsterdam very early morning or a late evening flight and get there late morning. It's comfortable. It's quick (especially go with tail winds). The service is great. Food is always so so on DELTA but I stick with them because of Skymiles. I also like their ""global"" attitude. DELTA also flies Minneapolis to Paris. It's also a good flight but the Paris airport is harder to navigate than the Amsterdam airport."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Nice crew and excellent ammenities,"The greatest feature is the on board free wi-fi, specially in long flights.Good entertainment system and food options."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,COS TO EWN,"The pilots, attendants  and aircraft were all outstanding on this flight home from Colorado Springs.  We were in Comfort Class and it was worth every penny.  Extra leg room and attention from the attendants.  We love Delta Airlines!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Delta Suites is a Way to Fly,This is my preferred way to fly to Korea and Japan. Delta Suites offers privacy and allows for a good sleep. The only negative on the flight is the fact that Delta insists on serving dinner at the beginning of this flight departing at 0:50. On after-midnight Air France and KLM flights I took they allow you to sleep.
Date of travel: February 2020,30,cheap in more ways than price,"Not a fun trip.  Cabo to Seattle with a 3.5 hour layover in LA.  Customs was not courteous or efficient.  Took two hours to get through their gauntlet and back into the terminal!  Only food provided in-flight was a granola bar, almond, or crackers."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Delta the American Way,Fly Business if you have the option to do so. The service is typically American. You you would have had to have flown Asian and/or Middle Eastern airlines to understand the distinction.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,A potentially catastrophic day turned bearable,"With a cold front moving in from the west, our flight from JAX through ATL to PHL was delayed three times. Actually, we were ""automagically"" moved from one flight to the next as flights were delayed or canceled being informed all along by texts and emails. The gate attendant at JAX was amazing as she handled all the questions and frustrated passengers with aplomb; a true professional. With all the chaos of the day, in the end, I got a seat with extra leg room I paid for on the MD90. And our luggage was there in PHL, having arrived on an earlier flight, I assume. Kudos to Delta!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Delta was great!,"This round trip flight was great and Delta was very helpful with particular arrangements on these flights.  We went from INDIANAPOLIS to Atlanta and changed planes for the last leg to Bonaire.  Same thing for the round trip, in reverse.    Everything went perfectly."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Delta Airlines made me enjoy flying,Delta Airlines made me want to fly again. It was such a comfortable flight and the inflight entertainment was top notch. The service was great!
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Refund,I booked a ticket with Delta and I had some trouble with changing it. Clyde at the John Wayne Airport Delta desk helped me with my ticket. He is very professional and friendly. He even stayed over time to help me. If it was not for him I would probably not give another go.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Overwhelmed,"Being celiac and having to fly for 14.5 hs from Detroit to Korea I was a little nervous. Connector flight to Detroit was cramped. Boarded in Detroit and was happy to see pillow, blanket, slippers and ear phones for movies, had requested gluten free meals and got all three of them. Staff were nice and provided drinks as well."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Give Delta Some Love,"I'm a long-time traveler of Delta (and Northwest before the merger) and have come to appreciate the steady rounds of improvement throughout the airline over time. This particular flight out of Minneapolis went smoothly and arrived on time.However, the CUN airport experience was another matter. Delta Flight #499 is scheduled to land at 3:15 Eastern Time, along with seemingly every other airlines direct-to-partyland flight. Consequently, the airport was jam-packed with couples, families and extended families. What a zoo (although not as bad as Puerto Vallarta). We eventually funneled down into immigration control: a large room with 32 manned passport stations. The hamster lines were so packed that we couldn't even figure out where to stand in line, and there was certainly no one around trying to make order of the chaos. After 20 minutes I scouted to the right and found an entrance, but it took us almost 2 hours from deplaning to get through immigration. Fortunately, by that time our luggage was sitting to the side off the carousel, and the pass through Customs was very quick. From there, we eventually found our shuttle company. From deplaning to getting to the shuttle took 2 hours and 15 minutes -- not fun when you're traveling with a 3-year old and 15-month old who missed their naps."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Good on time flight!,"Most importantly, flight left right on time and arrived smoothly at destination.  Short flight from New Orleans to New York, about 3-1/2 hours.  Crew was fine and served in a timely fashion, just the usual no frills soft drinks and coffee and snacks.  Premium economy afforded a little more leg room for my husband, who is tall.  I am a pretty big fan of Delta, they usually come through!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Enjoyed the flight very much.,"Had a good experience with flight.   Crew very nice and very good selection of movies.  On the way home flight was delayed by an hour and half, but not their fault.  Was weather conditions.  They did a very good job keeping me notified of status through text, and even offered to change my flight for a later time in the day for free."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Day flight back home!,We got this flight out of Amsterdam. I would think Delta has the best in-flight service in Economy compared to some of the other American airlines. The seats are pretty comfortable and the service was commendable
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Why pay for first class when the crew doesnt care???,"We had such a great flight from Atlanta to the DR the previous week.   The crew was caring, nice, accommodating, and made you feel the extra $$$ was well worth the spend.   THEN - you have the complete opposite experience coming home.   Just goes to show the crew makes the difference.   We had 3 drinks on the way down, they only offered one on the way home??The food was terrible, not what we ordered, and to top if all off, one of the crew members was busy sucking on a lollypop the whole flight.    Seriously???they did not even say goodbye or thank you.This whole crew should be retired.   They were veterans of life, and acted like they would have rather been anywhere else except taking care of the guests.BOOOOOOO DELTA - this is EXACTLY why we are more loyal to another airline."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Nice flight,"My flight was ok. We left early so we arrived early to our destination. I loved the snacks, but was really upset we had to pay for headphones! These used to be free so my headphones were not compatible with the screen and I could not watch anything on my 4.5 hour flight. My seat wasn’t as comfortable as I remember it used to be. I also volunteered to check my bag when it ended up being more than enough space on the plane. Truly inconvenient for me, but I survived and my bag didn’t get lost."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Flight great; airport terrible,"The overall flight was great. They served food and drinks to all on board. The worst part of the trip was getting through customs in Atlanta. This process is slow and stupid, especially for US citizens. You take a picture of your passport then present it to one of a few of the customs agents working. They in turn take the picture and send you on your way. This was not a speedy process and we almost missed our next flight even though there was a 2 hour layover. Terrible in Atlanta..."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Melbourne to Orlando Flight,"Great airline and deal I got.I was monitoring flights for a couple of months for a business personal trip through multiple websites.Managed to find a great deal and flight route from Melbourne, Australia to Orlando, USA.Meals were good. leg room fine. Im 6'2.Communication was great. One slight issue was last flight was delayed. So got into Orlando 1 hour later. Didn't hinder my plans, just a little frustrating after such a long time travelling. Though communication was good. :)"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Flight ,Both flu ghts were great.  No issues with anything.  Love watching movies on the flight.  It helps time pass.  Very well organized.
Date of travel: January 2020,40,International Premium +,"Have done both Business/First and Economy on many long haul flight. Tried Premium + and was OK. Better leg room and pitch than economy so was a better experience. Food was good as was options and service. Plane was clean and well serviced. For the money its not a bad option. Economy is way too crowded, tight and not comfortable for this length of flight. Business First or First is too expensive now as we are recently retired. Airlines need to come up with a better pricing model for retirees. We travel a lot and pick and choose dates and locations and experiences and are willing to spend on some comfort but NOT at the current price levels that First costs."
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Flghts 7 hr late arriving and 15 hr late on return flights,"On my flight out I was delayed by 7 hr. It is a 2 hr drive to the airport for my sister. Thus, she had to wait around Spokane for 7 hr waiting for my flight. The return flight was delayed 1.5 hr due to a mistake fueling the plane. Thus, I missed the connection in Atlanta. Although Delta did provide a room at a nice hotel for the night, I was hardly there for 7 hours - not enough time for a restful sleep and no meals were provided eventhough I asked. I was 15 hr delayed on the return flight. Given these extremely long delays on both flights due to Delta airlines problems, there should be some compension from Delta. So far none has been offered."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,First Class meals are a joke,"Granted it was a full flight that took off at 9:50PM but the least they could do for the money is give you a decent meal - or two.  About an hour into the flight we had a chicken sandwich that was worse than anything I've ever had.  Just a chunk of chicken on a bun, a hint of lettuce and mayo.  Wow!  Would've been nice to give you a little something for breakfast but no... just the handouts of granola bars.  Alaska and British Airways has you beat by a mile!"
Date of travel: January 2020,40,on time and smooth,Good flight on time and smooth. Delta normally reliable service was good and friendly. Yes I would do it again.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Expensive but very good,"Delta continues to be a first rate airline.  Service, timeliness,  and staff professionalism are above other airlines.  But it does come at a price.   From my perspective, it’s worth it."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Hawaii,No real issues however our connections coming home were a little tight and we had to go across the airport to our next gate so had to hustle which didn't give us time to grab a bite mid trip like we did when were were on our way to Hawaii.
Date of travel: February 2020,20,They didn’t pack enough meals,"This was kind of a horrible experience. They had 3 meal choices, one vegetarian and two others. Of the 3 they packed only 6 vegetarian plates for an entire full Boeing 777! They also packed only 15 of one of the other two options so you heard the flight attendants apologizing to almost every passenger that “we ran out.” This wasn’t a simple thing for the vegetarians on the flight who had indicated we had special diet as once they ran out of the 6 plates, there were no options for us, for the 13hr flight. Pretzels! I met several vegetarians by the snack area loading up on pretzels. That’s what we had."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,DFW-JFK-BOM,"Traveled from DFW to BOM via New York JFK. Overall the flight was good. Leg room was ample, food options were decent and the entertainment section had a lot of good movies and TV shows on demand. Delta really shines in its service which was good throughout the journey. Flight attendants were helpful and kind. We arrived in Mumbai on time. The only real complaint is the fact that we had to do additional security screening from Mumbai when leaving for New York. I feel like this was unnecessary. Otherwise, everything else was fine. This remains a good option for those that don’t want to fly gulf carriers and want to head straight to India from the US."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"Friendly, helpful , SAFE","Delta is by far the best airline to travel for efficiency  , safety and friendliness. The pilot keeps passengers informed which helps those afraid of flying. We had updated movies which made the time ""fly"" by quickly."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great Experience ,"I loved everything about my flight in Delta. From checking in bag, boarding, the plane...all the staff was helpful and friendly and the flight was really comfortable and enjoyable. The seats were comfortable, I loved that they had individual TVs for each seat with a wide variety of movies and music and the have a few complimentary snacks available plus meals and drinks on sale."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Timely information,Delayed as the inbound aircraft from Memphis had to be replaced.  Kept us informed both through texts and gate announcements.  Made up a little time in the air.  Crew was sensitive to the delay and kept that in mind in their interactions with passengers.  Delta made the best of a bad situation.
Date of travel: March 2019,50,Ms,Love ❤️ love love delta airlines!  Flight attendants are always so friendly and polite.  Never have the horrible lines and mishaps as I’ve had when flown with other airlines.  Delta keep it up!
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Slow,Delta is slow. Baggage claim toook more than 40 minutes. They gave our free earphones to some and charged others.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Excellent Round Trip Flight From Detroit To San Antonio,"Seats seemed close but flight was very comfortable, smooth and quiet. Attendants were very polite. Flight got us back to Detroit ahead of schedule"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,"Another safe, uneventful flight.","Flights both ways were just fine.  Friendly staff, clean plane and--most important--a safe flight.  Both trips left on time and arrived a few minutes early.  Luggage was no problem and everything went just fine."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Wonderful Atlanta Gate Agent & Flight Attendants,"I always fly Delta, but the particular flight I took to Sarasota was great because the flight attendant and Gate Agents made sure all the seats were full, exit rows occupied by the appropriate passengers, switched some seats around to accomodate guest requests and they were so courteous and efficient.  Great service!  The operations by the two gentlemen were impressive!"
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Privilege of spending money to spend money,"Shame on Delta. The cheapest flights didn't have the option to alter your flight plans, so I spent $70 extra to have the luxury of a flexible schedule.When it came time to actually change the flight, it was an additional $300. Delta can rot."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great trip,The flights were on time. We made all connections with out any problems. Received luggage on both ends of the trip.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,bad experience,"1. We booked the ticket through FlightHub for five of us.One infant,two kids and two adults.It was showing our names in the itinerary sent by FlightHub.But when we went to the airport, one of the KLM staffs didn't allow us to enter the flight saying that the infant name is not showing in their system.Then they sent us back home.2. When we booked the ticket,the Flight Hub staff didn't inform us that if there are more than one stops in Europe,we need to get transit visa.So that we have to change the ticket at last moment, and it costs more than $500.  ref:JQHA93"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,767 First Class seats,"We used points to upgrade to first class on this 767 and it was awesome. The seats recline so you can sleep, there is a massage feature for your back. The food was good, it is an airplane, and the bathroom, yes the bathroom was huge, for a plane.   I could not find any good pictures before we left so here are some from our experience."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Great experience flying in and out of the Midwest,"We had an easy time checking in, printing boarding passes, and checking bags. The process of boarding flights was easy. Flights were on time and attendants were friendly and efficient. We appreciated being able to watch a movie on the flight from Boston to Minneapolis on the first leg of the trip, and then from Detroit back to Boston on our way home. Pilots gave us the feeling of confidence."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Great Flight!!,"Roomy, clean, fabulous short flight. Got there in less time than anticipated!! Flight attending where very nice!!"
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Crappy customer service - no surprise there!,So don’t bother showing up for your 0430 boarding time early like you’re supposed to. This clown act doesn’t start checking folks in until 0400. All you can hope is the security lines move along or you’re screwed. The reason delta can give all its employees a bonus is because they screw the traveling public to save money. Awesome.
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Attacked by Delta CDG staff simply for being American,"The French check in staff are aggressive, rude and obnoxious. Recently, at Paris CGD, as soon as they saw my US passport, immediately accused me of being a ""drug addict"" (I'm a veteran) and demanded I pay for the luggage I already paid for. Then they delayed me for at least thirty minutes, took my phone and deleted my photos I took of those who were abusive and threatening! I objected to this unprecedented assault, they said that they will call armed police that ""will shoot""! Reported this to the airline, who ""investigated"" the incident, but offered a tiny gift voucher, they can keep it-it's an insult."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,"Vacation to Oahu...Whales,Shrimp Trucks, and Zip lining!",Delta 1... Outstanding!!! Terrific crew...helpful and friendly...a wonderful flight!! Hope we can do it again soon!
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Nice flight from Atlanta to Monterrey,"If you have business in Monterrey Mexico, the non-stop flight from Atlanta to Monterrey is pleasant. The Delta flight had on flight movies and didn't seem to take a long time. A good flight to Monterrey!"
n/a,50,Wonderful flight attendants! Laurie and Gerri!,"I'm a nervous flyer and my husband was ill. Laurie took such good care of us! Gerri was fun also, she kept a smile on our faces! They were kind, compassionate and funny. Would love to be on all of their flights.  Thank you ladies for making an already nerve wracking situation a better one! Thank you for taking such good care of us. The Ollos family Nicole and The Big Dill 🤣😉"
Date of travel: December 2019,30,A different experience,"We were unable to select seats before our flight and our seats were allocated at check-in - several rows apart which was fine for us as adults, but can see it being an issue for families (not sure if they make an allowance to sit families together). Before boarding Delta announced that the flight was fully booked, and asked for volunteers to have their baggage checked in at no cost rather than take it as carry-on, this freed up space in the overhead lockers, something to keep in mind if your baggage fits in the carry-on limits, but there is no guarantee that this will happen on all flights.The aircraft itself was fairly basic with not particularly comfortable seats (have ridden in buses that are more comfortable) but the amount of leg room was pretty good for me, although I am not a tall person. A drink and snack was served mid flight. All in all it wasn't too bad but nothing to write home about."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Big Company Sensative To Big Needs,"This review is not about the flight (I've flown Delta before and have been satisfied) as it is about a service they provide.  My grandmother passed away and, as is typical for this type of life event, I needed a ticket on short notice that was financially unplanned.  I was able to book through Delta a flight with a berevement fare.  This saved me a significant amout of money and took some of the stress out of this situation.  It's nice to know a billion dollar company can still do things for their customers when it's needed."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Loved it !,Everything was perfect! Actually no criticism on them !Would love to travel with them in the future!
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Best Flights and Best Overall Experience traveling to Israel from the USA was on Delta Airlines,"I'm a Tour Leader who takes people to the Land I love most- The Holy Land, Israel and I've traveled on numerous airlines but the number ONE that in my experience has outshined them all is DELTA AIRLINES. They have been most efficient, most professional and fully doing their duties to assure security but without the condescending near abusive treatment often experienced by tourists. The flights were all on time. The attendants both in the airport and on board were all helpful and assisted as needed with smiles and complimentary interaction. I recommend DELTA to anyone or any group flying USA to Israel and you will never be sorry! thank you Delta Airlines!"
Date of travel: January 2020,30,Flight to India,"I thought the flight was good; but wish for a few things. One of my main comments has to do probably with something I cannot change; room in the plane. It just seemed like there was not a lot of space. The food was just ok. I had flown to Uganda on Delta just this summer so I guess I was expecting better. However, one positive I can note was that there was not a lot of interruptions on the intercom as in some flights."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,To Belize and back,"Everything about Delta was outstanding, from check in to flight service, including the pilot, luggage arrival, etc.   No problems or issues at all."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,No compassion they could care less,They closed the door in our face after delaying our flight from Vancouver due to not fueling properly. We pulled next to the gate 3 gates from where our plane was boarding and they told the attendant to close the door as we approached.  Wow are they BAD!!  They could care less about a customer to get an on time departure. Was offered nothing and no apology.  They just don’t care. I fly with them often too. POOR!!
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Delta for great service and arrival times.,Great experience with Delta fromTampa to JFK. Nice plane. Staff was nice. Snacks were good. In flight movies were good. I also love that we arrive a bit earlier than expected. Over all aces.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,New direct non stop flight from Bombay to JFK in New York,"This flight has just been initiated by Delta two days prior to my flight . The whole experience was wonderful right from the check in , the lounge and service on board . It was a new 777 with spacious , well organized cubicles with flat beds . Great onboard service with very attentive staff ( Mr Sameer went out of his way to look after this old couple!) .  My special Asian Vegetarian meal was one of the best I have had in my 50 years of flying . The seamless transfer to my domestic flight at JFK with in the same terminal also was a good thing . My only suggestion for improvement would be the security and boarding process at the gate. Keep up the good work and get better"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Wow,Really food?  I thought that ended years ago. Yes we were given food on both flights. We also had free WiFi for apps and texting. Will definitely use them again.
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Hawaii,"We experienced delays do to mechanical problems at Sawyer international just making connection in Minneapolis thanks to electric cart personnel. Seats were comfortable a and crew                   Very    professional  return flight was 8 hours comfort could have been better if seat had afoot rest, would have liked a stop in LA to break up flight. Still Delta tries harder."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Terrible Customer Service,Terrible experience and will not fly Delta again!  Plane delayed for fog which was understandable.  That delay caused our group to run across the airport in a frantic run across the airport to catch a connection.  After the run we watched them close the gate and stopped by the next one to request mercy.  Asking that they allow us to board the plane we watched through the window still connected they seemed to be uninterested as they dismissed and redirected.  Went to the service center where we continued to be unable to find resolve.  Attempted to charge us $75 ea fees to go on standby and broke up our group onto multiple flights (which was our ride) without consult.  Gave a 1-800 number upon request to speak to a manager.  Absolute lack of customer service and highly recommend to pick another airline.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,brithday trip to disney,we did a brithday trip to disneyland and Amanda our flight attendent was fantastic she made my brithday flight very special and i am 58 years old. all of the flights went very well
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Flight back home from Paradise,"At this time my family used Delta to fly, we were not disappointed, flight was on time, plane is clean, entertainment was good. Flight attendant attentive. The time of departure was OK.I will consider to use Delta in the future."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,"On time, safe flight",Our flight was on time and every thing went smoothly. Flight attendants were attentive. Arrival was on time as well. We would definitely recommend Delta Air Lines.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Cancuntrip2019,Airline was great. Everyone we encountered was courteous and went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable and happy with our flights.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,A Great Flight,"When all goes well we are lucky and with Delta, we have been very pleased.  We were upgraded coming home to Business class.  That was comfortable."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Comfortable flight,"Every time I have the chance to take the exit seats, I do. The extra leg room is great and allows you the opportunity to stretch out a little. Used to do the economy airlines but I missed the little things, like free drinks and snacks along with the extra 3"" in seat width...or is that just my imagination?"
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Delta economy comfort,"We use Delta frequently.  We flew on Thursday as this is the only day the ATL to PSP flight runs. Wish they would run that on other days. This is our first time flying economy comfort. It was okay, but flying 3 seats isn’t fun. Business class was ridiculously expensive."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Technician,Service sucks Took my backpack in Saltlake and said they check it for free. I thought thatMeant airport to airport and I could get it when we arrived.WRONG Check all the way they to IL and I could not accessMy meds and water I never asked them to take my bag but because overhead was full with bags way too big they took mine and put my health at risk.I told aManager and he “ said I could get my meds before boarding plane” No wayNo one was there at the door and my backpack was not waiting.I am going to let my company know this can not happenNever use Delta ever againMany others fly to the same places and asTechnicians weCan drive and Delta can go to hellGreat way to treat a Veteran
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Good Solid Flight,"Flew Delta from Raleigh to Madison, round trip, from January 27th - Feb 1st. Good Flights all the way (Raleigh --> Atlanta --> Madison going up, Madison --> Detroit --> Raleigh coming home). There was a delay from Detroit to Raleigh, but the pilot kept us updated as much as they could. The flight crew in all cases were friendly, and the boarding process smooth. Nothing necessarily out of the ordinary, but a good solid flight."
Date of travel: January 2020,30,okay...,On our outgoing flight we were told it was oversold and would be put on standby so we arrived at the airport extra early to ensure we got assigned seats.  Delta's app crashes constantly and doesn't seem to give you real time information regarding your flight.
Date of travel: February 2020,10,"Delta's lounge with 4 hour layover. CRAP, CRAP, CRAP!","It isn't enough to purchase a ticket going across the Atlantic ocean, then upgrade ($$$) to ""Delta confront"" and have a Delta credit card that has an annual fee of $99.00. You will not be allowed in their lounge no matter how long your layover is. You must pay extra ($250.00 a year) for the higher credit card level or just buy a lounge membership for $500.00+++. That is what they call service and it is crap. Who knows what they will require next? Just find a airline that will appreciate your business because Delta doesn't!!!"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,JFK-SLC   737-900 Economy,Decent flight in Coach on 737-900 JFK-SLC.  Interior was clean and bright.  Service was standard. Check-in process was not chaotic and flight crew worked really hard to fit carry-ons even though flight was 100% full. Departed on time and arrived 45 minutes early!
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Friendly Staff,"I was greeted with a smile from the start.  As a matter of fact, I was in the wrong line (priority) but the attendant had compassion because of the long line and helped us away.  They were all nicely dressed in the beautiful eggplant Delta uniforms. The flight attendants going and coming were very professional, helpful and nice.  I highly recommend this airline.  On a sour note, I was not at all happy with FLL airport.  The Delta section was crammed with people everywhere with little help.  I had a bad back and had to stand in line for over two hours.  Fort Lauderdale needs to work on better accommodations for the Delta passengers."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Delta is my “go To” airline for all domestic flights in USA and most International flights,"Premium Economy is a pretty good deal for long haul travel if you don't want to pony up for Delta one business class. I think its a good value. Made this flight many times and Delta always excels. I also use delta for all my USA domestic travel needs. They do a great job of getting you to your destination safely, and most of the time in a timely manner. They cant control the weather, and they do their best to to keep aircraft in good condition with minimal mechanical delays. I love the delta APP. Can track bags, locate lounges, check flight status, all in real time. Good Job @Delta."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Very pleasant flying experience,"Trip started out with the airplane developing a pump problem just before takeoff.  We went back to the gate, and deplaned.  Delta got another plane ready and we left for Dublin.  Only ended up about 3.5 hours late.  This was a tremendous effort by the airline to ensure we got to our destination."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,On time flight,Easy check-in. Flight on time. Good service. Space is tight for tall people in CRJ-900 economy class.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Thanks for the room!,"Even though the KC flight took off late (needed de-icing) we arrive in Detroit on time. If I had not had to wait for a bag on the jetway (my fault for not making it truly carry-on for the small jet), I would have made my connection. As it was, my connecting flight closed the doors before I could get to the gate.Another gate agent rebooked me immediately - for the next morning. Initially she was not able to offer a hotel, but then looked again a few minutes later and.... yahoo! I had a room for the night at the Delta Marriott.  The shuttle was direct and quick. In the morning I was less than twenty minutes from the hotel elevator until I was through security and on the final leg of my journey.THANKS DELTA!"
Date of travel: January 2020,30,An old rust bucket,"I traveled Comfort Plus (although not sure what the ""plus"" is) from SLC to AMS.  I have traveled Delta many times and they have lovely new planes, but not on this route!  This was an old, uncomfortable and nasty plane. Small little TV screens, NO AIR VENTS, lighting that doesn't work (mine first wouldn't switch on, and then turned on on it's own and wouldn't turn off); one toilet was out of order so we had 300 people using 3 toilets while first class had 20 people using 2, and we were told we couldn't use their toilet.  Bugger that! Food was pretty awful as was the wine which was poured sparingly.  And once the food service was done, you couldn't find a flight attendant for water perhaps?  And yes, I did ring the ""bell"", but that clearly doesn't work either.  If Delta really want to see what a long haul flight should look like, try Qantas, or in fact, any other airline!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Amazing play who is amazi,It was amazing.there food. Was amazing and also the seat.It was so comfy and nice .Forget this the tv is 40 inches.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,At the recommendation of a friend,"At the recommendation of friends we booked Delta for a short stay in New York before returning to the UK on the QM2 our flight from one side of the USA to the other was excellent with a great and friendly cabin crew the aircraft appeared new and was spotlessly clean , the inflight food and TV was 1st class ."
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Service  unbecoming,Yesterday 2-10-2020 I flew home from Jamaica Montego Bay with a transfer from Detroit to SF on flight DL 915. Because I flew a lot on Delta last year I was able to use my skymiles for a free trip in the Comfort class. Everything was fine until they passed around the snacks. It was very dark and very difficult to see what’s in the basket that a tall male steward was passing around. I wanted to get a packet of almond and a dark chocolate health bar. But I picked the wrong cookies. I tried to change but the steward yanked the basket from me and gave it to the next passenger. I thought that was very rude of him. His manner was also very arrogant. The service varies so much from one flight to the next. In the previous flight from Montego Bay to Detroit flight DL 2930 the hostesses couldn’t do enough for the passengers. I guess I started to expect the same. But I must say I’m still grateful to Delta for the seats I got from the miles. I’ve been with United for 20 years and it’s getting harder to use the miles. I’m now changing to Delta. I just hope I don’t run into that very tall and rude air steward on board delta 2930 again.
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Seat assignments have changed,"I really like Delta for the most part, but I booked a travel package back in May 2019 for a trip in January 2020, approximately a week before our trip I recieved an email that stated, if I wanted to select seats I could for an additional $30/passenger/trip - otherwise my seats would be assigned at the gate. I felt like after spending $3600 on a travel package they wanted me to pay an additional $120 to be able to sit next to my Wife- that's bad business. After all was completed we were able to sit next to each other without paying the additional funds, but I'm not sure if that was coincidence or not. When I book travel, I surely would like to have a seat with my Wife especially whan I book it over 6 months in advance!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Friendly comfortable service,"The early morning flight is best as 3 hours are lost going east across the country. The flight crew goes out of its way to be cheerful and engaged even though it is routine for them. This route uses the most up-to-date equipment with plentiful outlets, good WiFi, and an entertainment system that includes live-TV. This makes the 5-hour flight seem shorter. The seating is comfortable. As a frequent flyer, I get frequent upgrades, a niche perk."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Cheap seats to China!,"One knows that 12 hours in an economy class seat will not likely be the high point of a trip! Yes, seating was snug, though not as tight as some other fights we have experienced.    Yet, this middle leg of our three flight journey from Kansas City, MO to Schenzhen, China did have some strong points.  The food was better than typical, with a good variety of choices, and wine, beer and spirits were free (at least to some point!?!). The flight staff were pleasant and helpful.  We were flexible on travel dates, and able to buy tickets at a very favorable rates."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Delta Airlines,"Excellent service on all aspects of this flight from the check-in service to entire cabin staff.  Delta is my ""go to"" airline."
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Good flight but a bit pricey,"Departed and arrived on time.  This was my second leg of trip home from Dallas to see Penn State Bowl game so I expected the cost to be above ave. but think that paying almost $800 for a round trip was a bit much, ( I flew American to get there).  On flight from Dallas to Atlanta it was enjoyable to watch TV on the flight.  Leaving AVP airport was quick and easy."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Simply a breeze,"As normal flying with delta was on time and quite fast. I always fly in basic just because I feel that it is not worth the upgrade for flaying under 5 hours. Delta provides you with amazing service throughout the whole plane and makes sure you feel safe from the moment you put your carryon in the overhead bins. The Delta app makes it easy to have everything you need right at your fingertips, from your boarding pass, seating information, and if your gate changes or your flight is delayed you are notified right away. I really like using the Map feature on the app to find something good to eat or to make sure I am heading in the right direction. And I tell you what, cheese-its and a sprite taste so much better at 33,000 feet.   One tip is if you have delta sky miles, use lift instead of uber. You can link your lift account to your sky miles and earn miles for all the lift rides you order."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,.,"The screens in front of you on the seat, the snacks it was all good! I had a great trip, especially being able to binge watch You!"
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Made a run for it,"The layover in Salt Lake City was really close and I decided to ""run"" for it. We had four people in the group and I didn't have a carryon so I could go faster and tell them to hold the door.   DO not run in Salt Lake! The altitude is much higher than I am used to and I was so out of breath that when I made it to my next flight I couldn't stop coughing. Also, I learned that the next flight new that we just landed and were holding the door for us anyways.   Lesson learned, don't run in Salt Lake airport."
Date of travel: May 2019,30,Good airline,"Delta has always been our 'go to' airline for domestic flights. It's a good airline, sometimes the planes aren't clean and the staff are never very friendly but they go where we want to go."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,A pleasent trip,"I can say that the service on board of Delta Airlines has improved a lot in its quality, as well as the part of food and drinks, giving preferential treatment, even in economy class."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Flying Delta,I love flying with Delta they are always so accommodating and cheerful. They are always on time and meet my travel needs.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Very underrated airline,"Excellent experience. Food, service and entertainment were great. I am not sure why they are not rated higher."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Cruisers Beware,"Delta will not allow you to check luggage until 2 hours prior to flight departure.  Arriving from the cruise port at 9:15 for a 2:16 flight we weren't able to check our suitcases until12:16.  Problem is that terminal 3 is ill equipped to accomodate hundreds of people waiting to check bags on a Sunday morning.  Seating is limited and most people had to sit on the floor for hours.  There are no eateries, only a newsstand.  First time going out of this port but now knowing the situation and can plan accordingly for the next cruise."
Date of travel: June 2019,30,Nice flight,Delta has gotten expensive compared to other airlines.  I have always enjoyed the flights and tv on international flights are nice but many times can get flights for almost half on another airline.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,"Smooth, comfortable flight.",Smooth flight. Ontime departure and arrival. Entertainment screens available on the setbacks featuring movies and music.
Date of travel: June 2019,50,"On Time, best value, great service","Have flown with Delta for years as a gold card member.  Plane departed on time, got a boost to comfort+  at the gate to accommodate another passenger.  Flight was smooth, and the stewardess was polite and always smilig."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Always Delta,"I always fly Delta and this last flight did not disappoint. They are organized, usually on-time or even better than on-time (I find my flights land early most of the time) and the crew is always friendly and helpful. I appreciate that they now have gluten-free snacks (Kind Granola Bars and roasted Almonds). And outside of my personal experience, I was pleased to read that Delta pays their employees a healthy profit-sharing each year, and this year was the highest. That is the right and decent thing for a large business to do, especially when their business runs on people."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Terrible service at Atlanta,"Lost my flight due to maintainance  at my origin in Frankfurt, arriving there was nobody waiting to help us in catching flights, went to the counter and was booked for a next day flight, asked for my luggage and they asked me to get it at the domestic arrivals.After waiting more than 30 min. for the supervisor she said that my luggage was supposed to be recovered at international and clear customs.at the end she said was impossible to give me my luggage. wasn't offered a food voucher.2.5 hrs delay didnt got any compensation and lost my connection.BAD."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Nice to go directly from Atlanta to Key West,"The San Jose to Atlanta leg was fine.  As economy passengers, our expectations aren't too high.  Food, service were average.  We flew Delta because they had a direct flight from Atlanta into Key West, which saved us one extra connection.  The flight into Key West is short, and the runway on which we landed the ""shortest commercial runway in the US,"" according to the pilot who warned us about the steep approach and the hard braking we would encounter.  All went very well.  The direct flight into Key West saved us a 4-6 hour, very tedious drive from Miami to the Keys if we had driven."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Good Flight,"Flew from Omaha to Cancun. Connecting flight was through Atlanta both there and back. First time I have ever flew Delta, a few flight attendants from Omaha to Atlanta were kinda grouchy. Not sure if it was the 5:30 a.m. flight or just a bad start to the day. Otherwise the remainder of our flights were very good."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,It was an airline flight.,"Not much to say - in general, flying is a miserable experience for a casual flier. Since retiring, I don't fly frequently enough to pay for TSA PreScreen program, but did get early boarding since I flew first class. ATL (connection) is a royal pain on a good day. PHL is a third world airport. Even in first class, the only food offerings were snacks. But that's what flying is all about anymore. Delta makes it as painless as possible."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,A great flight,"It was an incredibly comfortable flight from Boston to London.  Delta gives you complimentary headphones, pillow, blanket, snacks, and two meals.  Plenty of in-flight entertainment options to enjoy.  The staff was warm and welcoming."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Flight Home,"Flight was a good one.  However,there was almost an hour delay in departing at connection in Minneapolis.  We had to wait for deicing.  Pilot kept us informed the whole way home"
Date of travel: January 2020,40,24 HOURS OF DAYTONA,Good flight   was on time and good connections.  Just wish there were more flights and shorter lay overs  but the flight itself went perfect
n/a,20,Delta makes YOU do all the work.,"We flew to Cancun and back and both times we were separated by people. We booked and checked in at the same time but when we received our seats in MSP their were 2 seats between in (yes, we checked in the night before online.) We each got a middle seat and between people who were also separated from their families too. There was no way to switch for a middle seat to sit by each other so I was stuck by a cranky woman who hated to let me out to use the restroom. This flight coming back, we tried checking in at the airport to see if that would help seating. It didn't. We had a party of eight. Checked in at similar times at different stations. I checked in with my husband. I had an A seat and my husband got a C seat in same row. Not to mention half of the people in our group got a seat when they assigned them at the desk. Us others did not. Half got assigned seats by each other, half did not. I aaked Andrea Chavez Avina from the desk why they didn't assign our seats and they said we had wait for our names to be called (even though half if our group were placed.) We waited. Then got called and they were separate seats!! I asked a gentleman at the counter and the same lady (Andrea) butted in and said, ""all seats are full. Ask a person to switch."" Why is that my job? Why do I have to work to sit by my husband when all they had to do was assign us correctly. She still insisted the flight was full and we need to ask. Seems lazy and a poor system."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Off to the Snow,"Check-in went smooth, plane departed and arrived on time, actually ahead of time.  One complaint is the baggage fee.  Delta and all the other airlines should just make the baggage fees part of the ticket price."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Delta Economy is an insult to basic passenger rights.,For anyone who has traveled basic economy class on Delta it will remind them of what it is must have been like traveling on the Titanic in 3rd class.  Basically you have no rights to choose a seat and will more than likely be placed next to the toilets at the back of the plane no matter what type of aircraft you are on.  You will also run the risk of being bumped since you your seat will not be assigned until everyone has boarded and good luck trying to get your bag stowed in the overhanging bins.  It is bad enough that travelers are subjected to smaller seats and less comfort on planes but Delta takes first prize for scamming travelers when you consider it forked out 1.6 billion in profit to its employees for 2019!
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Don’t get there very early 😥,Got there very early for a Delta international flight. Was with a Delta Platinum flyer traveling Delta Premium  Select to Australia. The Delta web site said to get there 3 hours early. We planned to hang out at the club and not in the no chair Delta checkin area. We were told that we could not checkin because we were early.
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Good Flight,Good Flight. Service was good and in-flight entertainment was good. On-time for the most part. Have flown with Delta before and will again.
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Comfort Plus,"We flew to Rome in Comfort Plus, August 2019. I had flown coach trans atlantic on another airline decades ago and remembered the long cramped flight. The upgraded seats were well worth the additional cost of the flight. We had plenty of legroom, comforable seats and the flight was structured to prevent total boredom. meals and hot towel service were well paced throughout the flight.I visited the restroom midflight and saw the cramped quarters of coach. Very happy with my choice of Comfort Plus."
Date of travel: March 2019,50,Best Airline,"This is the only airline that till this day hasn't disappointed me. The staff is really nice, the general flight attendance good, always arrived on time. No complains."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,More leg room!,"We haven't flow Delta in a while. So pleasantly surprised! There was more leg room than the other airlines we have flow in recent years. There was a charge for the meal, but the snacks were free and generous. Staff courteous and on time!"
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Avoid Delta connections through LAX at all costs ,"Every time I fly through LAX on Delta, I suffer extensive delays. Tonight 4 hours due first to weather and then crew timed out. All AA flights left within 10 minutes of their scheduled departure today.Delta terminals are awful! Small, dirty, no power, few seats at restaurant/bar options, small ineffective bathrooms, connection between terminals 2 and 3 with stairs leaving terminal 2 on a bus or you have to go outside security to walk. This is not the quality I have come to expect from Delta. Won’t suffer this again ever!"
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Delayed,Flying from Atlanta to Jacksonville NC. Flight delayed because of plane in VA delayed. Why doesn't Delta have extra planes when they know it's weather issues.
n/a,40,Get a bigger plane for this route ,An RJ175 is way too small for this route especially when it takes almost 3 hours. No entertainment screens so you are on your own. Staff was great and the flight deck did a great job. Next flight on a A321 was better and half the time.
Date of travel: February 2020,10,None,"I would never fly Delta again, nor would I recommend it. The airline assigns seating and they separate passengers that are on the same purchase confirmation number."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great flight,Great flight all the way around. Captain kept us informed about everything. Service could not have been better or more friendly.
Date of travel: January 2020,30,Average Experience,"Reliable airline, always on schedule, mostly courteous staff.  Even on premium economy, seats are too tight.  Food for purchase is usually not good. After many experiences, we bring our own food aboard. Delta seems to do a better job than the other domestic airlines. They have deleted some flights so we cannot fly at our desired time as before. This is a reliable means of transportation, not the great experience of years ago."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Pleasant flight,"We took Delta from U.K. to New York on Premium Economy. The first thing we got was a complimentary “Welcome Cocktail” for any and all adult customers. How nice! It was Peach Bellini, a refreshing drink to start off the flight. The in-flight food and drinks were pretty good. We had Gnocchi in Basil Cream Sauce with Prosciutto, and Marinated Chicken Breast as our first meal. The second meal, which is more of a ""snack"" before arrival was more fun. We had Caramelized Red Onion Chutney & Goat Cheese Pizza Twist, and Barbecue Chicken Pizza Twist. The quality and option of the food and drinks have gone up in my opinion. The seat was comfortable, legroom was good for me. They offered enough entertainment such as movies, TV shows,  music and more. We had a pleasant flight back to JFK without any issue. The flight attendents were all nice, polite, and friendly. Thanks to all the flight attendance and staffs! Have a safe and fun flight, wherever it may take you!"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Almost Always Delivers Quality Service,"Delta most always delivers for me, high quality service from caring employees. It reminds me of Southwest (in terms of the joy that their pilots, flight attendants and gate agents seem to have when doing their jobs) but with the added perks you'd get from a full-service airline such as assigned seats. I would take two Delta legs vs. a direct United flight."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Met Expectations,Delta continues to meet my expectations with customer courtesy and efficient operations.  Flight attendants are business like and make an effort to accommodate passengers without seeming curt or rude.
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Stress free experience.,First time flying with Delta and found it less stressful than other airlines.The boarding process was smooth with no hassles.There was no constant announcement of checking in your carry on.People weren't lining up before their boarding was called blocking everyone else.I don't know if this was because of the way Delta operates or just got lucky on this flight.They offered free earphones for the entertainment system.My connecting flight was delayed and it did take a long time to get off the runway but I'd expect that from all airlines.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Delta is Always great,"It’s always a joy to fly Delta, especially to/from Atlanta. We traveled to Cancun for our BabyMoon and were able to watch our inflight movies with no turbulence."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Not perfect,Mid cabin passengers allowed to use first class lavatories and mid cabin also allowed to disembark first before mid cabin. Why did I pay so much money to be denied the perks of first class?
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Best Airline,"I have been flying with exclusively with Delta for the past couple of years now and it's worth every penny. However, this flight was probably the best one ever. We arrived almost 30 minutes early with no issues."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Delta has upped their game recently,"The connection to the flight was close, but we made it without a problem. The food was good as was the service."
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Work,I was pleased with the service aboard the plane. Also the movie selection.the access to the airport was easy and the staff were very accommodating.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Incoming flight was delayed,"The incoming flight to Phoenix was delayed and were informed well in advance.  Once the flight came in, they moved very quickly and we were able to catch the next flight from LA to Columbus, Ohio.From LA to CMH, it was red eye and it seemed very smoothly."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Great Service for a 24 trip,"The first leg of our flight from Boston to Detroit, was in First Class and we were treated by an exceedingly friendly staff at the crack of dawn. We started off our next leg (Detroit to Narita, Japan) in Premium Select and the crew was very attentive and hospitable. I was a bit dismayed to find they had run out of options for dinner and my only option for dinner was an Onion Frittata. I don't like onions and the Frittata was riddled with them so I was unable to eat a bite and the stewardess said there was no other option so I was a bit hungry. It's a shame there wasn't even the option of even having a sandwich considering that a lot of people in this world don't like onions. At that point, I was grateful that I had hung on to my earlier snack of a banana and granola bar because I was starving. The last leg of the trip (Narita to Manila) was in Comfort Plus section since the plane did not contain a Premium Select section. This plane was an older model and very loud. You could not understand what was being said over the speaker system and the temperature of the plane was freezing. The negative things I have mentioned brought the overall rating of my trip down but due to the excitement my sisters and I shared at going ""home"" to a country where we had grown up and not visited for just over 40 years, I would rate the flight as very good."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Delta,Plane was late due to having no crew.  And we missed our flight home. Yes they put us in a hotel.  But I just wanted to go hone
Date of travel: November 2019,50,First time in new style cabin good experience,"First time we had flown in Delta Comfort+ cabin. We were fortunate to be at the front of that particular cabin and the flight was not full.The service was excellent and choice of snack and drinks good. We had this booked as part of a round trip from London booked with Virgin Premium. Although the Comfort+ seats were comfortable they don't compare in any way with Virgin Premium so I would not want to fly transatlantic in that cabin, although from MCO to JFK (we then connected on to a Virgin flight)  it was perfectly fine. Our flight was on Thanksgiving so was very quiet."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Great Service and Smooth Flights,"Due to a flight schedule change we were bumped to a later flight for fear we wouldn’t make it through customs in time. We ended up making it through and the flight was delayed so we had time. Delta service was so helpful and gracious, put our whole party of 6 on standby to try and make it but not lose our seats on the other flight. We got back on the earlier flight AND our luggage made it. Every staff member was helpful and did everything they could to make our flights smooth and easy."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Greatest airline in the world!,"After making plans six months ago to travel to Thailand in February 2020, we cancelled three days before our flight because of the coronavirus. My son's ticket was on Delta. My husband and I flew on Emirates out of Dulles. We had to take a loss on the Emirates tickets, but Delta gave our son an $1100 credit. The problem was it had to used by September, and we couldn't reschedule by then. I wrote to Delta customer service and they granted us a refund within a day. No hassles. Just really great customer service. Delta treats passengers like human beings, not like sheep to be fleeced. (I'm talking about you, Emirates.)"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,On Time- pleasant staff,"Sadly, the only flight that gets my attention is a bad one. The staff was great. We were on time and there were no incidents. That is a great flight in my book."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Over The Wall,"You don't have to remove shoes in Cancun,but my boarding pass disappeared in the X-Ray machine.Strange there was no seat assignment for me in""basic economy""-I just refuse to pay extra for a seat.I hadda get a seat at the desk,asked for and received an aisle without a problema.There were 4 different classes before Zone 1 was called.It was a 737,how long could it take?Free movies,but no live TV.Tho they did give free  messaging too.Two or 3(for me anyway) times they came thru with soft drinks and snacks-I like their ginger cookies.Cupla bumpy spots but we were in 20 minutes early."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Ohare is huge,Delta is a great airline.  Ohare is a huge airport with plenty of food options.  The flight Chicago to Boston is easy.  Delta flight attendants are great.
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Great flight,Great flight.  Nice and easy.  You get a meal in first class on this flight.  Very nice flight attendants.  Chicago’s OHare is huge.  Plenty of food options in the airport in Ohare.  LaGuardi Delta opened part of the new terminal.  It’s nice.
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Great airline,"I love flying Delta.  You can get low rates when you book the shuttle a month plus in advance.  The Delta folks are always nice.  First class is great.  Difficult to get out of LaGuardia once you land with construction.  Make you take a bus to the cabs.  Uber is better most times.  Delta Shuttle planed are shows their age, but still enjoy Delta."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Professional On-Time Service,"From check-in to baggage claim areas - Delta soars above the rest when it comes to providing its customers with courteous, professional service regardless of what class you fly. This flight was on-time with its departure and arrival in Miami - including the Presidential TRF. One of Delta's slogans comes to mine - We Love To Fly And It Shows!"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Excellent service as always!,"Even though we had a bit of a bumpy flight, the crew did a great job of keeping everyone updated on the status."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Consistent and Courteous,I like to fly Delta because of their availability of flights and track record.  The flight was on time and even arrived early both to and from Denver. I like the Delta Skymiles Club for downtime and grabbing a drink and food before a flight.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Plain Plane Praise,"Smooth flight, gracious attendants, interesting magazine, good options for snacks, We flew economy plus - which you don't have listed as an option.  There was no in flight entertainment nor did I care."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Great service!,"Great flights both ways. Fight attendants were so accommodating, kind, courteous. The only need for improvement would lie in debarkation, especially in LV. It took nearly 20 minutes to get off the plane!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,On time or early -- my way to fly!,Each of my connecting flights to and from Washington DC were on time and we arrived to the receiving airports early. Enjoyed watching a movie on the Delta app and the option to have Cheez-Its for a snack!
Date of travel: May 2019,50,Consistently on time and courteous airline,"I fly Delta airlines almost exclusively once or twice a year after trying a few of the other airlines a few times for slightly better prices.  I have discovered that I prefer Delta as it is almost always on time and provides frequent updates and information with consistently good service when it is not as is inevitable.  The seats in economy, main, and comfort plus are relatively comfortable but obviously nothing compares to first or business class.  That said, it is significantly better than the comfort of similar class seats on other airlines in my opinion.  Leg room is  never a problem on Delta and that is important to me as I cannot bend one leg more than a few degrees.  My leg does tend to go to sleep but I've found that a leg hammock solves that issue like a charm.  I will be flying the new premium select level on our next trip to Scotland in July and I have faith that it will be worth the slight difference in cost and a great value for the money.  Although, I am still looking forward to the time when I can upgrade to delta one.  :)  Most planes have in seat entertainment unless it is small hopper plane for short distances in which case it doesn't matter as much.  The amount of selections from movies to tv shows to games and the flight tracker keep me mostly distracted from start to finish.  The staff are friendly, polite, and always professional from checkin to departure even in the worst of times.  I have yet to encounter a single rude staff member even when my behavior and anxiety level would have prompted a rude response.  The food is okay.  Nothing wonderful but palatable and mostly enjoyable.  I appreciate that it is served with a smile, frequently, and while it is still warm.  Lastly, and I hope I don't jinx myself here, I have never been afraid on a Delta flight.  We've had a couple bumpy landings but my understanding is that is actually a good sign for landing.  I don't remember why but the plane should bump a little on landing.  That tells me that Delta employs and trains their pilots and staff thoroughly and ensures that those with our lives in their hands are fully capable and quite possibly the best in the air."
Date of travel: January 2020,30,Paid more but still got a real tight seat,"Flew from JFK to FCO, and with the cost of a checked bag got Premium Economy but didn't get much room. The 7Plus hours on and inside seat was pretty cramped and tight. The return trip on Alitalia was nicer. Will think hard about the next trip."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Great service,I enjoy delta because i feel as though the seats are a little bigger and the space is accommodating especially when in economy. They gave out free headphones which i appreciated since i lost mine on the trip.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Long Flight,I was on Delta operated by Air France on the way over and apart from the length of the flights it was well done.  On the return on Delta I was upgraded to Comfort Class which made my return way more comfortable
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Never fly Delta,Had to cancel flight not asking for refund just credit like Southwest does. Will never fly Delta domestic again terrible airline. Funny thing is I forfeited full fare 3 days in advance. I am sure they will rebook seat make double in it
Date of travel: February 2020,10,HORRIBLE AND INEFFICIENT,"I was unable to get any seat assignment on the outbound flight, and when I called for assistance, no one could figure out what went wrong or how to correct the issue. I was tossed from one operator to another. They were inefficient and frustrating. Ended up speaking with a supervisor who was the same + unfriendly!I will never fly with Delta again, and wouldn't recommend them at all."
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Bumped from Business Class,"We normally book first class, but on Delta, there is no first-class to MBJ. The biggest problem we have is when a flight becomes unavailable due to weather mostly.  We have had both.  They then dump you on to another flight and then lose first-class or business class. There are two things we hate about this if you agree to take the flight there is no refund or credit (they are required to do that in the EU) the other is that they give medallion members stand by upgrades but people who have paid for the seats get nothing. This seems totally unfair.  We watch 20 people get upgrades last minute at the gate but not us (we did apply for the upgrade).  Now all of them could have been bumped from another flight but 20?? (that was the count) There should be some recourse, how Delta just says F- U.  We don't call that good customer service.  We understand they all do this, but Delta promotes being all about the customer. We believe this is just stealing from the customer.  They might as well reach in my back pocket and take my wallet.   It would not be any different."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Pittsburg to Cancun,"This flight was really good. Left a little late due to de-icing. Very nice plane 737-900. private video screen with free movies. Bring your own headphones, the free ones are not great."
Date of travel: February 2020,40,2 hour flight,"Everything was smooth but they now just offer unhealthy snacks, saving money from the breakfast they used to serve I guess.  We were 45 minutes on the runway coz of weather.  Still it is better to travel in the morning.  AA has moved its flight to 6.59 pm, not learning from the last time that they did that.  One can expect very late arrivals as a result."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,So tired of rude Delta employees,"Delta employees, especially in Atlanta, tend to be so rude and entitled, and do not you with problems, even if it’s their faults that there is a problem. They overcharge, and look for any little thing to charge you extra. I’m using up my skymiles and then I will not ever be using delta again. I’ve had way too many unpleasant experiences with them. One time a Delta employee in Atlanta even tried to fight me. Delta is too overhyped and not worth the all the extra money you have to pay just to fly with them."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Delta One DL 0026,"A Perfect Delta Flight Team from Incheon, Seoul to Atlanta made for a most relaxing and thoroughly delightful flight.From the gate agent Pang, the diligent, superb pilot and co-pilot, the personable purser William, the ever dedicated flight attendant Carlin, flight attendant Vicki, and everyone on the Delta 0026 team, THANK YOU!It is Delta’s professionals and the phenomenal personalities you have coupled with the pure love of what you do that continually sets Delta apart, in the sky and on the ground.Delta, you’re the Best!"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,fight to cancun,Very courteous service and we were treated as if we were sitting in better than the economy section.
Date of travel: January 2020,30,FAY to ATL,"As usual I like to take the early flight out of Fayetteville. The 0600 flight is normally packed, even with the larger plane. The agent at the gate was friendly and helpful as many people crowded her while trying to get passengers on the plane. The flight to Atlanta is very quick.  There is time for a quick snack and a few minutes of movie watching. The crew was pleasant as usual.  The return flight started out uncomfortable. I normally take the last flight out, but this time I decided to take the 1702 flight.  This flight has a much smaller plane (CRJ 200).  Luckily the flight was not full, so I gave up my comfort + seat for an empty row a few seats back.  This flight didn’t have wifi service, so there was no inflight movie on this trip. Good customer service all around."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,RDU to DCA,"Quick flight to the DC area to visit family.  Very short flight was able to watch about 30 minutes of a movie. If you are a frequent flier of delta, I would recommend the lounge for a quick bite and drinking.  Great area to hang out in while waiting on your flight.   The crew was pleasant as they gave a hardy greeting during  boarding.  The second leg of my trip was delayed.  My flight was routed through LGA.  This leg was delayed due to the traffic in the New York area.  We had to sit on the plane for about 20 minutes before takeoff.  The captain kept us informed of the delay.  3rd and final leg was smooth.   Good service all around."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Flight was late; connection too tight,"Probably the worst flight ever.  Delta was scheduled to leave Bogota at 11""40 pm, giving us more than 3 hours to make our connection at JFK for Detroit.  It didn't depart until nearly two in the morning, and we landed in one of the worst airports I have ever experienced (and I've been around) with less than hour to clear immigration; retrieve our checked bags; clear customs; re-check our bags; clear TSA security; and run over half a mile to the LAST gate in our concourse. My wife cleared TSA ahead of me and ran to the gate--just in time.  When I arrived the door was closed and my wife was standing with the ticket agent waiting for me.  I made it with three minutes to spare. All of this happened on a Delta-to-Delta connection IN THE SAME CONCOURSE.  The problem was Delta scheduling and incompetent TSA screening, which added to the delay."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Delta Is Consistent,"The flight to Melbourne went off without a hitch. On my return flight, I had to wait before I could go through security, as it didn't open until 6 pm. Anyway, the flight was delayed a bit, which is unusual for Delta. However, we were on our way fairly quickly and I did make my connection. I think the difference between Delta and other airlines is its consistency. On time, friendly staff, and the air attendants always treat you well. I believe their seats might be slightly bigger, which, believe it or not, can make a huge difference in how you feel. Imagine that, an airline that actually considers your physical comfort."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Pretty good,"Comfortable seats, good in flight entertainment and pleasant crew. Timely take off and early arrival at Heathrow."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,"So, this is how you are supposed to be treated!!","From the start to the finish this was an amazing flight.  Customer service from the gate to the Flight Attendands was top noch on this short flight from LAX to PVR.  The seats were extremely comfortable as American Airlines thinks that there Business Class seats should feel like concrete.  I am not sure if all their planes have IFE but I sure did and was happy with the selection of movies to choose from.  My Lunch meal was Excellent!!  The flight attendant called me by name, which is a nice touch, not always the same service on the other Big 2.  My only issue is  I wish there was a more direct flight from Austin to Puerto Vallarta but well worth the longer flight....and More Miles to my balance."
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Worst airline,dont ever take it American airlines only the lady said an hour late wait after the guy just said half hour wait so what is it an hour or a half hour or do they just pick a time litterly he said half hour lady comes on 2 minutes later and says an hour stupid
Date of travel: January 2020,40,FLL to JFK,everything was great plane left a few minutes early and we were early into JFK - flight was smooth -   somehow they skipped our row for refreshments but eventually did bring them
Date of travel: January 2020,30,SRQ to CVG,Flight was over booked and they were offering $800 in gift cards to those that could take a later flight from SRQ or an additional $100 if you flew out of Tampa.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Direct flight,Delta flight was fine. PUJ airport was good. The only problem was coming back to MSP at the airport. It took 90 minutes to get through customs. Not enough workers for the number of flights arriving.
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Literally the BEST customer experience ever!,"I had literally the very best customer experience of my life with Delta. Due to a very stressful and scary experience in regards to my health, my husband and I had to cancel a recent flight quite suddenly. When I called customer service to sort out the details the agent I interacted with not only expressed sincere and genuine concern for my wellbeing, he also quickly and efficiently handled the cancellation. The call ended with me thanking him and him once again providing his best wishes in a way that was, res, kind, respectful and utterly human. It was incredible not only to have my issue addressed but also to feel cared about by a stranger. One very grateful customer here."
Date of travel: January 2020,20,Poorly planned and inconsistent service,"There are no direct flights from STL to LHR, so I had to fly via Minneapolis. The weather wasn’t great, and the inbound flight to STL was delayed. At the start of boarding, I still had plenty of time for my connection, but slow boarding and de-icing caused me to get to Minneapolis in time to see my gate closed. I was rebooked you fly via Amsterdam, with a total of a seven hour delay. The biggest problem I had was that my LHR plane was still at the gate and I was refused boarding. However on the AMS flight they reopened the plane doors, after the departure time, to let late connections on. Why couldn’t they have done that for me. As I felt the delays could have been prevented by better boarding and more accurate timing information, I complained. On a $7000 ticket, I was offered $25. Eventually I got them to $100 of points. Flights were otherwise comfortable, with friendly staff though."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Huge Plane!  Boarding in the Middle is so much easier!,"This was a huge plane for a short flight.  When you are in 40F, it is nice to board in the middle of the plane.  I was disappointed to find the movie that I started on a previous flight was not available to finish on this flight.  I do not understand why they are not in sync."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Old Plane!  Had its Issues!,"In-flight entertainment was only available using your cell phone on this flight.  I selected a movie to watch and thought I would finish it on the second flight, only to find out it was not available.  Systems should be in sync or at least, what is available on the cell phone should be available on the seat back entertainment systems.  Plane was not full so I had the entire row to myself.  The tray tables did not have the impression for the cup holder.  I did not realize it but my drink slowly slid off of the tray table when I was not watching and surfed my jeans in Diet Coke.  Luckily, I had brought Subway onboard which supplies customers with extra napkins which were much better than the small cocktail napkins that the flight attendant could give me.  Gate attendant at Bradley was so nice!"
Date of travel: January 2020,30,Rude Gate Staff!  Flight Delayed as we waited for another plane!,"I was upgraded to First Class.  Having never had this experience before, I went up to the Gate Attendant and asked if she was going to reprint my boarding pass.  She then proceeded to announce the boarding of the plane and told me that I was going to have to wait until everyone boarded to get my boarding pass.  When I replied ""Are you kidding me?"", she told me to use my old boarding pass to board.  I did not realize that the new boarding pass would print out once she scanned the old one.  She could have been more accommodating to my request.  We then sat for a half hour waiting for passengers to board from the San Francisco flight.  We did not get into Bradley until 12:25 am.  I was afraid that Alamo would no longer be open as they state they close at 1:00 am, but they stay open until the last flight arrives.  A very nerve wracking trip!"
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Very Accommodating Gate Staff!,Gate staff was very pleasant to work with as I had to have my seat assigned.  He asked me whether I wanted an aisle or window.  Nice flight!
Date of travel: February 2020,50, Trip to Bogota and back just wonderful,We used to travel with American because we go to Medellin to visit family and its straight flight from Miami-Medellin. We looked for some tickets for this trip and found Delta had a straight flight from ATL to Bogota Colombia so we decided to give it a shot we would only have to buy a ticket from Bogota to Medellin in a Colombian airline which in USD comes out way cheaper. Not only was the flight on delta easier but also was more economic than in American Airlines.The flight to Colombia was smooth and service was outstanding.We had some issues and unfortunately couldn’t board our original flight back on Friday 31st so we had to stay in Bogota. Obviously we had to pay the difference to rebook but due to the nature of our issue they waived the rebook fee which is greatly appreciated. Once we got to our flight back home I just want to say the flight attendant Samuel on flight DL0980 was simply the best attendant We have ever encountered he was personable and attentive. Usually attendants only stick to their duties of passing drinks or food and assisting whenever but Samuel was going above and beyond with every passenger anticipating the needs of all. His personality and service made this flight the best me and my wife have had in a long time Thank you
Date of travel: January 2020,20,Delta claims they're there to help with handicap assistance,"A few weeks ago. This is a tough one. As I have put in a complaint on line-per their directions- and they are first now looking into reviewing it. So its difficult and will probably need an update later in hopes that they just don't say oh my we are so sorry that you had this experience.  Husband can not stand or walk for long time. As it was he became ill in Florida at a visit. Cleared to go home we went to the airport in the afternoon. They got their wheelchair and took us to gate. Seems he was the chosen one to get the full treatment of security check. Now, this I understand and I get it. Its their job in efforts to keep us safe. They had him stand and go thru the body scan. Ok. Then they kept him standing. When he was dizzy and went to reach to hold on they would not allow him to. They would not allow him to sit while they checked him and spread and scanned something on his hands. They ignored me when I stated more than once that the man needs to sit. As this part all could have been done while sitting. Seems the woman before him had a foot boot. They made her take it off. She sat in the one wheelchair there designated for him. They had to ask her to get up after he was done so he could finally sit. I was  upset, frustrated and concerned and glad he did not fall or pass out causing further problems. As for the plane trip, other than a cold dousting of water spilled from a really sincerely lovely stewardess, opps, no problem accidents do happen, and shared smiles, I did note to a steward that the seats had small space and asked if my husband if there were any others available for his comfort. The curt reply- no this is a full flight, have him sit and keep his legs down. The flight was super fast and the pilots did a fine job of getting us back in record time though we did have to sit on the plane until the tarp opened a space. Overall in that area though the Delta flight was fine. The PAX people really could be more assisting and communicative. Thankfully a lady sitting at the turn style for the luggage told me where to find a chair I had checked as it was not to be seen anywhere along with where an elevator was. Not the smoothest experience this time. My friend mentioned something about getting precheck. I will look in to it. At least, like JETBlue, they did not insist on checking a bag that had my husbands meds in it that he had needed to take... As I noted above, I was really glad my husband did not fall or pass out. We , I/we didn't need the added stress."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Delta stole my luggage,"At check in the lady behind the desk was distracted and assisting multiple people at once as well as talking on the phone. In the middle of her helping my boyfriend and I check our bags she sent us to someone else to help us. We did not know what she had completed for us and neither did the other delta worker who sent us back to the other lady. This delta worker had our information and another persons information all over her counter. We noticed we did not have one of our luggage tags and when we asked her about it she told us we did we pointed out the we each had two and there should be one more but she told us there was no charge for that bag. We thought that was odd but we assumed she must know because she was so forceful that we had everything. The whole process had taken so long we almost missed our flight. The flight by the way was a direct flight. At our destination one of our bags did not make it and we talked to the airline at the airport, called them repeatedly, filled a claim and still no luggage and it has been THREE WEEKS. The customer service has not been very helpful and pushes our phone calls from one person to the next without any help in locating our luggage. In the bag is paper work with both of our names on it yet still no luck finding the missing luggage. Delta has stolen our luggage and I will never fly them again and I warn anyone planning to travel with them not too because they will steal your luggage."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Orlando to Jackson Hole for winter Vacation .,"We flew Delta from Orlando to Salt Lake and then Jackson Hole, WY.  We also flew Delta from Jackson Hole to Atlanta, and then to Orlando, Fl. All flights were on time and pleasant experiences. I am not particularly fond of flying, never have been and never will. I fly occasionally because it is necessary. All the Delta employees were great and served us well. I have driven to very state in the USA over the past years, except Hawaii, and that is my preferred method of travel. I was pleased with Delta , and if the occasion rises again, I would fly with them again."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Wonderful trip,"The flight was wonderful and non eventful.  The Delta people were very nice, respectful and helpful. The employees went the ‘extra mile’ to make our trip comfortable and nice."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Lenore,I remember her name because she had fabulous service. She was friendly and professional. The flight was a little over 3 hours and she made it feel like 3 minutes. Bravo to an exceptional flight crew.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Great Airline,I fly Delta whenever possible. I like the professionalism and friendliness of the entire crew regardless of which class I am sitting.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,one of the few airlines that still serves free drinks and snacks on board,"Delta is one of the few airlines that still delivers excellent customer service on so many levels.  they are great with any issues you may have either at the gate or on the phone.  the airplanes are pretty clean and modern.  they still serve free drinks/ snacks even on short flights.  prices are pretty reasonable to most destinations and they are great about keeping you informed in the event of delays.  i was scheduled to fly out of NYC to Orlando during the holidays and got a notification about a delay in my flight very early in the day.  this helped me take advantage of the extra time running errands and wrapping up things at home, instead of wasting time sitting at the airport.  the fly delta app is a great way to have info at your fingertips as well."
Date of travel: January 2020,30,Not impressed with PARTNER Crews...just not Delta Caliber.,"Staff just doesn't cut it anymore.  Delta USED to be SO professional.  The past 4-5 flights I have taken I have found the flight attendants VERY lacking.  They are loud amongst themselves, they tend to ignore the passengers (first class too).  At one flight a late night flight, being first class 1st row, the flight attendant station was immediately in front of us and they chattered and chattered and ignored the guests and the lights were on blaring in our faces... It is just out of control.   NOT HAPPY WITH FLIGHT ATTENDANTS.  I KNOW many flights are SUB'D out to ""partner lines"" and I believe this is MAINLY the case.  But gee Delta, THEY ARE WEARING DELTA BADGES.... he least they can do is SMILE.  I feel first class expense is a JOKE now.  It used to be a drink or two, refill on water, snacks.   NOW it's like 1 bottle water upon departure and IF you're lucky you'll be offered a drink with the meal...certainly not before.   I flew to Hawaii a few years ago and WOW, the service then was AMAZING.... these last flights..  NAH.... if anything... VERY SUB PAR."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Delta is consistently a winner for a reason.,"My trip from Edinburgh was just as enjoyable as my trip there. There was a Flight Attendant named Bobbi who was an absolute delight.  The other ladies were great but she really stood out.I try to fly with Delta whenever I can and it is always on my dime. I don’t travel for my job so when I’m paying for it, I want a great experience. Delta always delivers. Bobbi is really an asset to the company and I appreciate the terrific job she did in making my flight awesome!"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,"Short flight, everything was perfect","Just did a long weekend trip to Fort Lauderdale, we always fly business or first, but we used a buddy pass for this flight, so the best we could do was Delta comfort. It was perfect! Plenty of room in the overhead, plenty of legroom, and a smooth, non-eventful flight."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Great flight,It was a great flight.  Got out of Atlanta a little early and made it on time. Checked my bags and they were there on the carousel when I went to baggage claim.  Overall a good flight
Date of travel: February 2020,20,Undisclosed,"I had such a nice experience it seemed like. Then found out that the 24 hour cancellation policy doesnt apply to me. The agent never disclosed the full price of my cart over the phone,  or that the evoucher may leave me without that 24 hour buffer. Feeling a little deflated about the whole thing. $1800 is different than $3600. And the tickets online for premium are not as expensive as what I was charged in the end.Definitely will not be using delta again. A $100 credit for a prior trip that had issues because of delta should not eliminate my 24hour risk free cancellation, and if it did the agent should have to say that. And why would the upgrade cost more on the website than over the phone booking. It makes no sense. Even upgrade charges likely aren't 6-700$"
Date of travel: February 2020,40,Delta does RDU,I'm always relieved when I'm able to find flights on Delta. I wish their options from CVG were more competitive but I still prefer to pay a little extra to fly with them.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,easy,easyno issueson timewhat needs to be said about a flightlong lines at Atlanta to get thru customs glad we have global entry  no line there
Date of travel: February 2020,10,tryed to go early but no unless emergency,i tried to go early because seats on earlier flight. they said no..i had to wait. i was business class with gold statis.. my plane ended up being late and i almost missed my international flight to paris.. why not help and if there is room let people go....???shame on you delta.............
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Good flight.,"Nice flight.  We departed on time, and arrived on schedule.  Staff on the first leg of our flight were exceptionally personable.  Actually ordered food, and had a chicken roll up.  Can't remember the last time I paid for food on a plane, but it was good and I'd consider doing this again.  Seats were comfortable and I loved the selection of movies.  Provided us with custom's forms (this is a common practice), but the flight crew also helped walk us through the form. The staff at the Boise airport were wonderful."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Comfortable,I love the in free in flight movies.  The seats were very comfortable.  All of the staff was friendly.  I would fly Delta again !
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Coming or going Delta always the best,Delta offers a direct flight to DTW from CHA. It is so convenient and quick. The flight is always pleasant. Imgine flight attendants always smiling and being courteous and professional. Delta has them. This airline is my go to and when I can't fly with them I miss the experience.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Very accommodating for husband with broken leg..,Delta was great to fly with and I'm looking forward to flying with them again soon.  They were extremely accommodating with my husband who was flying with a broken leg.  Service was excellent.
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Upgrading next time,"The staff was very friendly. Our flight to Memphis was not bad. We left on a Wednesday so the airplane was pretty empty and we were not squished all three of us in one row. Our flight back from Atlanta to Sacramento was a nightmare. We left on a Sunday and it was packed! I was sitting on the window side with two adults next to me. The lady next to me felt like she could take up all of the very little elbow space you have. And my seat on the way back felt ""mushy"" and sliding off. I kept trying to push it back but it just kept sliding out. And of course our tv screens were glitching on an almost 5 hours plane ride. They tried to restart the screens and see if it helped but it did not. So trying to pass the time and watch a movie that was constantly glitching was beyond annoying. If you're flight is long, I recommend upgrading your seats."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,"Usually pretty good, reliable airline","Normally, we have good experiences flying Delta - they are typically on time, staff at the gate and on board are courteous, and they are informative. A recent flight from RDU to ATL, though, the gate agents were frazzled due to the aircraft being late incoming (due to mechanical problems). They did not keep people in the gate area updated with the most recent information, which led to panic and them having to rebook almost everyone in the gate area (most people were connecting in ATL, myself included). Thankfully, I used the phones in the help area instead of waiting to talk with the gate agents. The woman I spoke to was helpful and quick in rebooking me on a later flight (which the gate agents had told me previously that I would ""for sure"" make my connection...then later made another announcement that they were incorrect). This was a bit of a messy situation, as you can probably tell. It's not what we have come to expect from Delta, though, and in our experience was the exception, not the rule."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Awesome flight,"Love Delta, everyone is so professional and courteous.Always smiling.Always on time great service.No luggage issues.Service service service.I actually have stopped flying American and United to many issues delayed overbooked flights.Tired of American Airlines time out policy for late flights and then they cancel and you are stuck."
n/a,10,Rude and annoying,"I fly delta about every six weeks. When I do so with my tiny emotional support dog, not only do I submit all the paperwork before hand and get approved but they are the ONLY airline who does not allow you to check in online. I get it, they want to physically see the animal, so I get to the airport early and wait in the special services line as required. When no one is working this line, I am annoyed. I am even more annoyed that the lady requesting my paperwork at the desk has no idea what she is looking for/at and continues to tell me how everything is about to change, policies are going to become more difficult, ect. Keep in mind all my paperwork has already been approved and I have done everything that is required in this situation. Delta makes life more difficult with these extra precedures and is rude on top of it and adds in additional steps to already stressful travel days. I will be switching airlines in the near future. This employee needs to be trained on how to speak with people and know how to do her job."
Date of travel: February 2020,50,Aruba vacation,Great flight great service quick and assist you quickly. Really nice I think We’re on schedule it sets a great time for the rest of your day these airports are very busy and it was nice though to have it together.
Date of travel: January 2020,40,"excellent, as usual","Unfortunately, had to fly via JFK (NYC) to get to Florida. this is a destination we fly several times a year. It's always excellent, thougfh I prefer the shorter route via ATL.I judge a restaurant by their house wine - a good restaurant will not serve a crappy house wine.Hence, the airline's Economy service is key. First Class gives not a true impression of the company. Delta is consisten and take very good care of the budget traveler. The only times I've had any problem was when the weather stopped all flights, or when the connection was too tight for bags to make it.On this flight DL 141, 14JAN20, flight attendant Justin gets the medal for cheerful and thoughtful service. Not just to me, but for the 'back of the plane.'"
Date of travel: January 2020,10,"Terrible service, flight delayed by 6 hours because no backup pilot crew available","Our flight was initially scheduled to be pushed from the gate at 8:12am and arrival at St. Thomas 13:10 local time. Everything was on schedule and around 8:05 doors were closed.First delay happened however right at that moment passenger at 22C decided that he want to leave the plane, doors were re-opened and passenger was let go off the flight, this added probably 10 minutes and I’m not sure if Delta protocol allows this in a first place.We remained at the gate for a while and without any information, finally about 15-20 minutes later pilot informed us that plane will be de-iced and it should be done at the de-icing station. It was a line and another 25 minutes went by. All of a sudden announcement came asking for a doctor. There were at least two on board and they were rushed to the back seats to check on someone and came back telling on the way that ‘everything is ok’. Meanwhile plane was parked on the taxyway with no announcement of what is going on from the crew and everyone on board was getting more and more worried about when we will depart. Another 20 or so minutes later captain told us that we are going back to the gate to disembark two more passengers. Gate was busy and we had to wait again, finally doors were opened and two passengers were escorted off the plane.Waiting again, I’ve received message from Delta that our flight is delayed by another hour and only after that pilot announced that we need more fuel and it will result in another delay. Refueling took another half hour and once it was completed pilot told that now their time is up - pilots crew allowed to work for 9 hours straight and flying to St. Thomas and back would take more.More sitting on the plane waiting for what will happen. One version that was announced - and confirmed by looking at the flight plan on flightaware.com - is that we will fly to Atlanta, pick another crew and then to St. Thomas. Delta app was offering change to the next day flight. After another hour or so wait, pilots left the plane and some time later we were told to leave plane as well, take our belongings and go back to the gate “because plane may need some service”, but no announcement were made about Delta plan on handling the situation. Few Delta managers were discussing situation with each other next to the gate but did not share anything with us. Finally announcement was made to get back to the gate around 1pm, we were let back on the plane and were sitting again, flight attendant told us that new crew still not arrived. It took another 50 minutes to get new pilots onboard and finally we were flying back. No extra food was offered on board after almost six hours delay, it was no real apology from Delta and we were not offered any compensation. Also during the flight condition on the plane deteriorate, all coach class lavatories ran out of water in the toilets and were dirty and to add to all this at the landing plane touched down so hard that some of the luggage compartments doors opened.. this was scary.This chain of delays and absence of clear communication from Delta along with confusing changing plans resulted in inconvenience for everyone on board - see attached hand-written note with names, email addresses and seat numbers from many of the fellow passengers, this letter will be CCd to their emails. On the personal side, our family of 5 missed a day at the island that is expensive on it’s own, were unable to pick up our rental car as our flight landed at Some questions to Delta: - How you can schedule a single pilot crew for the flight to the remote island with no extra backup crew - when total flight time according FlightAware is almost 8 hours, this only allows one hour for the delays and JFK is notoriously known for the ground delays?- Why it was no crew available on call at the major hub? -Why Delta was not keeping up with updating passengers with contingency plan?- Why refuel was needed in a first place, it was no extra fueling at St. Thomas, this mean DL465 takes enough fuel at JFK for the round trip flight to save on the fuel cost at STT?  that basically Delta decided to put full plane of the passengers into the inconvenience instead of paying a bit extra for the fuel at STT. Without refueling crew would still have time to complete  our flight.- Why once we were forced back at the terminal, it was no announcement via SMS or email about Delta plans and also about availability of the food, etc? We found that it was some food distributed at the time we were re-boarding.- Why Delta did not truly apologized for the 6 hours arrival delay and why no compensation was offered to the passengers?"
Date of travel: February 2020,30,Delta Comfort + leaves a lot to be desired ,"This is a fair distance flight so paid extra for Comfort +.   Only got one drink service and one snack. This was a first flight of the day! 600 am. The seat and tray table were both smeared with something sticky. The seat pocket had a layer of crumbs that stuck to my phone and headphones. The seat area was not clean at all. This could very well be how so many people get ill. It would take a short period of time to wipe down the seating area, especially over night!! Not worth the money for this trip!"

Date of travel: February 2020,10,Terrible airline,Delta Airlines was a good airline but recently has gone way down hill and is terrible. As Diamond member for several years they could careless and treat you like crap. I’m changing Airlines as there are much better airlines with lower airfare. I absolutely don’t recommend Delta.
Date of travel: March 2019,50,Pleasure flying with Delta Airlines,"I have flown with a lot of the different airlines and due to the last two trips I’ve flown with Delta, I will never fly with another airlines. Fantastic personal, friendly, accommodating and professional.  Delta can truly be proud of there service and personal.  That’s saying a lot due to the length of the flights. Kudos to a Delta Airlines"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Transatlantic Flights,Delta and it's partner KLM is the way to fly across the Atlantic.  All of Delta's hubs (DTW and ATL etc...) are great.

Date of travel: January 2020,50,"Awesome customer service , after my laptop was stolen!!!!",We volunteered to check our carry ons. When we arrived in Detroit I noticed that my top zipper was open. I didn't think much about it. The next day we were looking for my laptop and discovered someone else's make up bag in our luggage . My laptop was gone. We asked the rest of the family about their luggage and some of theirs was gone through as well. I called Mexico security and they said that they didn't go through it. I called Delta and they said to file a complaint online. I file the complaint and got a response right away. They are sending me a check for a full replacement for the laptop. I wish it wasn't taken but at least Delta stepped up!!!

Date of travel: February 2020,10,Paid for first class given coach,"I was traveling overnight from Spokane, Wa to Mobile, AL for an emergency. Paid for first class because of the overnight aspect, however when I reached Atlanta I was informed they didn't have first class seats on the flight and that my carry-on had to be checked. The plane was not even half full. When I tried to clarify that what I had heard about the luggage was correct I was given attitude and told if I didn't like it I could find a different flight at my expense. It was not so much being moved in seats but the attitude I was given about it and not being informed when I booked the ticket through Delta. The least they can do is disclose the seat issues and the staff be reasonably polite."
Date of travel: March 2019,20,Big no,Three times flown with Delta. 2 times my flight got delayed and 1 time from JFK to Chicago they canceled. Terrible company
Date of travel: February 2020,10,Delta Charges It's Customers $200 to change a Flight!  Beware!,"Delta charges $200 to change a flight.  I booked a flight 80 days from today.  Had to switch my outgoing flight two days after booking it.  Delta charges for EVERYTHING!  But $200!? To change a flight?!  I will avoid flying Delta at ALL costs.  If United costs $1000 for a ticket that Delta charges $500 for...I'm flying United.  You suck, Delta"
Date of travel: January 2020,20,Bad service,On the way to Costa Rica a rude male flight attendant asked my name with attitude and later I realized it was because I requested a vegan meal. The meal was gross and it was thrown on my lap while I was sleeping. Then on the way home I got no vegan meal even though I requested one. Flight attendants also told me they didn’t have pillows when i asked which was clearly a lie because they had plenty for the first class passengers but wot  ok d not give me one for my back. I also got “randomly” chosen yo be searched. I am not happy with Delta anymore.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Great ride,"Overall trip was good. Boarding was reasonable, enough space in the overhead bin and the flight attendants were polite."
Date of travel: September 2019,10,Bad bad bad,"never tranfered bags in Salt Lake so never got to ship before it sailed.  So vacation was spent looking for underware and something to ware.  Customer service promised $5000 then said no.  We will give flight miles.  You go to be kidding.  Who would fly with again.  Lost customer, but you don""t care."
Date of travel: January 2020,20,"Not fun to be separated on an international flight, and booked for an impossible connecting flight.","My husband and I had to purchase our tickets separately so I could take advantage of credit card miles.  He called an agent to have them ""link up"" our tickets, and the agent PROMISED him that we would be seated together.  On our return flight home, from Amsterdam to Portland, we discovered we were seated separately.  The gate agents in Amsterdam couldn't have cared less and made no attempt to try to remedy the situation.  And of course once on board, our seat-mates refused to switch (which was their right, of course, but that meant we were stuck for 11 hours).Then, once in our connecting city of Salt Lake, the connection was so tight and Customs so disorganized (we had to check through security AGAIN!) there was no way for us to make our connecting flight.  We had to be booked on a later flight, AGAIN separated (To be fair, an agent in the Delta Lounge really went above and beyond to help us find seats together.  She was on the ONE bright spot on an otherwise exhausting day.)  We felt that Delta really dropped the ball.  What was promised to us did not happen for whatever reason.  They also should be more aware, when booking people through Salt Lake City, that this is not a reliable, speedy transfer point.  (This was not our first experience with missing flights in SLC.)"
n/a,50,Treated like Kings!,"We had a great experience flying with Delta. The food and snacks where great compared to previous flight meals, and I would like to send a special thanks to Aida. She has been treating is like kings, we have been spoiled all flight! Will recommend!"
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Very Bad Delta Customer Service,"As a Diamond-Medallion, Million-Miler Delta customer, I expect to receive good service. I don’t.I recently purchased a first-class return ticket from Orlando (MCO) to Northwest Arkansas Regional Airport (XNA). Before my return flight, I suffered hours of delays until they finally cancelled the flight late that night. They offered no vouchers for food or hotel. Although I had paid for first class, the next day I flew home in a back seat by the families and bathrooms.This treatment is par for the course for Delta. I’m used to it. But what frosted my cake was, just this weekend, I signed into Delta to choose my Diamond benefit certificates. They were all closed out. Turns out I was one day late! I wrote Delta, explaining that I had missed their guideline by a day, that it was my fault, and could they help me?I quickly received this curt one-line reply: “Unfortunately, once these expire or are used, these certificates cannot be reopened.”If this is how they treat their very best customers, how do you think they’ll treat you? I suggest you fly another airline. I know I will."
n/a,50,Delayed but on time,"Flying home to Knoxville from Minneapolis my flight was delayed 30 minutes due to a mechanical issue. Alerted promptly to the delay.Check in and security were quick and easy. We departed on the new schedule, de-iced and we're on our way. The in-flight crew were friendly and apologetic.In the end we arrived back in Tennessee within minutes of the original scheduled arrival. Great job making up time!"
n/a,50,Easy flight,"The flight from Knoxville to Minneapolis was a breeze. Literally 15 minutes from check in, through security and to the gate. Flight was uneventful, service staff was pleasant. Arrived early. I wish all flights were like this!"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,I like flying Delta -,"The flight was great.  Though I flew economy the seats were good.  I didn't feel wedged in which is always a great thing. The flight from Minneapolis to Austin is short, only a little over 2 hours.  You can watch a movie if you buy or bring your own ear buds.  The flight attendants are courteous.  Delta provides a free small snack too.  Delta has become my airline of choice."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,It pays to be a loyal customer,"I recently had two first class tickets booked on Delta 4 days apart.  They would be reimbursed by the client, but was diagnosed with lung cancer 2 days before the first trip.   Since I couldn't make the trips, I couldn't ask the clients to reimburse.  Although non-refundable, I appealed to Customer Care and they were both refunded.  I always fly Delta unless no other option.  Upgrading is frequent and easy, on-time is the best, my luggage is never lost or damaged.  The best domestic airline experience period."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Consistently meets expectations,"I have flown with Delta for over 30 years they have become the most reliable and customer friendly airline in the US. The gate staff provide you with factual information on the status of the flight and the boarding process. My wife and I were upgraded to first class thanks to my gold status for sky priority. The flight attendants were excellent, very customer friendly. Our fight departed on time and we landed 15 mins early. We received drinks and had a nice breakfast in the first class cabin. The pilots kept us informed of necessary information and was a great flight."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,relaxing flight,the seating was very good and comfortable. the screen was rather small on this boeing 767. our scheduled layover in new york was too short so we rather waitedin the noisy lounge. they do not have a designated quiet area nor do they have ample  reading material nor light snacks such as pretzels or potato chips. the steward waswearing a black polo shirt instead of the standard white shirt. the pillow and cover wasvery good. however the special kosher meal was very poor.the flight itself was excellent
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Excellent flight,Everything went smooth. Excellent service. I received free upgrade to Even More Space. Flight was much shorter than expected and I arrived home early.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,"Great Service, Staff and Flight","The flight crew was so professional, courteous and sincerely nice that it would be derelict on my part to not post a review so well deserved. The Captain came out before take off and gave a short weather, flying conditions and a personal Thank you for flying Delta. The food of course was very competetive to United Airlines in terms of variety, thought the main course was simply ""Awesome""  I have flown all cabins on Delta so this review may reflect what I flew but in no way diminishes the quality of service and staff in all fare classes. I recommend anyone to fly Delta. I am a regular contributor and end all reviews with a sincere -  ENJOY !!"
Date of travel: February 2020,50,"Incredible hospitality, accommodation and attitude!","From boarding to seating, the energy was wonderful. It was a relief to receive smiles and accommodation immediately with Delta. Luckily, I had an entire row to myself which made the duration of 13 hours very comfortable. I was able to stretch my legs and warm up with blankets provided. They greeted us with a Bellini cocktail and had an entire menu planned out, with multiple selections of food and beverages. As I was seated towards the back of the cabin, breakfast was limited and had to settle for the Frittata although I wanted waffles. They were extremely apologetic and offered alternatives, such as extra fruit or sides to accommodate - which was very sweet. The flight attendants were conscious on constantly bringing water or other beverages, such as tea, coffee without being asked. They left a selection of snacks in the centre part of the plane, allowing us in economy to help ourselves. They were polite and patient when ensuring we were seated during turbulence. If we needed to use the washroom at these times, they assisted without hesitation. The activities and screens worked well, had many options from movies, tv shows, music, etc. They also provided complimentary WiFi to send/receive iMessages, which was a lovely bonus (for those wanting to browse internet, email, or social media there is a fee.) Would highly recommend this airline to those traveling long durations. Hopefully you receive the same flight attendants as they were so pleasant! Thank you Delta."
Date of travel: October 2019,10,"Awful, awful, awful",I can’t describe the hell that Delta airlines put us through in the flight from San Francisco to Manchester. Delayed flight meant missed connection. Next flight cancellled. Put up in hotel. Flight to another city. Flight delayed. It took us 3 days to get home. Incompetent and uncaring. Avoid this company like you would the plague.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,We always try to fly Delta,"I recently flew with Delta with my daughter, daughter-in-law and three granddaughters to Cancun. We flew business class because I thought the granddaughters would be more comfortable to sleep since it was an early flight. The flight crew was wonderful, as always, except for one male flight attendant who must have been having an off day, because he was a little short with me. Otherwise, the girls received their “gold” wings and were treated wonderfully. This was another 5* Delta flight."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Amazing flight,I flew with family on my flight and the flight was amazing the flight attendeds were very nice and helpful the flight itself was smooth and fast. Delta for life.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,"Great flight, great staff!","First class is roomy, relaxing with the staff having superb customer service!!  Smooth and seamless process from RDU to LAS.  All in all a great flight experience."
n/a,30,Delta Donestic 1st Class Lacks Perks,"The seats and checkin are all good as are the nice crew. What is lacking is good food (the spinach egg entre sounded lovely, but was dry and inedible, and bizarrely accompanied by large greasy sausage, which we should have been asked about). The more troubling part of the experience is the lack of lounge access both in the morning at Boston Logan, and on the layover in Denver. A first class ticket domestically costs about 3X+ more for advance purchase. The seat and crap food seem to be the only perk. As a gold Delta flyer, I still don't get access (making that status worth very little). On a platinum Amex or platinum status gets you in the lounge. Thus, I simply cannot recommend flying Delta domestically in the business or first class categories."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,On time,"True to form on time and professional The focus on customer service is very noticeable, and an improvement over other airlines."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Good to Great/ Consistent.,Always have above average to excellent flights with Delta. In seat entertainment is nice Staff always good. Occasionally the food is mediocre for the cost when flying coach. Loading as expected Consistent and hands above all others that I fly 3-4 times a year. The only time I have been disappointed was booking companion fare with my wife and traveling with Mom tickets were bought separate but the seats I picked were together 6 months in advance. when boarding our way home they had moved mom to the back of the flight because she had a single ticket.  I'm a Platinum card holder and was not happy yet dealt with the inconvenience since it was just one time of many trips.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Headed to the Cruise,"We flew into LA to get on the Cruise to Panama Canal the fly was pretty good. about 4 hours ,we got there a day or two before the Cruise to do some site seeing in lA because my wife and I had never been to LA before."
Date of travel: January 2020,30,Flying on Delta planes were fine but checking in to partner flights was a bit unerving.,"We flew with Delta from LAX to Madrid and Rome and then back to LAX again. Checking in to the Delta flights were fine, but it was a bit complicated when having to check in with partnering flights. About a month ahead of our scheduled flights we went on the Delta website and picked out our seats. Then the day before we left we of course checked in to each flight. For the Delta flights this was fine, but when Delta partnered with another airline it got really complicated. For example on the way home the first flight was partnered with Aitalia. We went to check in online and Delta said we had to use the Aitalia website. When we went to the Aitalia website none of our Delta flight numbers worked. I then called Aitalia and they said they didn't have us in their system. Then I called Delta (from Italy), waited an hour on the phone (because I didn't have a call back number in Italy) to get to a Delta representative. Talking with the Delta representative they gave me a Aitalia confirmation number that I used on the Aitalia website. This allowed me to see my reservation but there was a big red lettered warning on my reservation saying I was going to have to see the front desk. I had a suspicion that the plane was overbooked and they were trying to bump me. So I went 4 hours before my flight (because I was worried) to the Rome airport and spoke to the Aitalia front desk. The issued my family a boarding pass (for FCO to CDG). It was not the seats I had originally reserved, but at least they were together. They didn't tell us the flight was overbooked but I think that is what was going on. Thankfully Aitalia was also able to give us boarding passes for the transfer part of our trip which was Paris to LAX (which were the seats we originally reserved). When we got to Paris they outright told us the flight was overbooked and were asking if they could bump people. They were also doing weird things like making us get into line and checking our passports, even though you literally had to just go through document control to get to that terminal. They also made everyone with roller bags check them in, this did not apply to us because we only had backpacks. I noticed that the Paris to Los Angeles flight was being serviced by 4 different airlines. I think this is why it was overbooked. I understand it is in the airlines best interest to leave with a fully booked plane, but instead of trying to play tricks with people just be honest. Just make an announcement and say we overbooked the flight and offer compensation if someone is willing to be bumped. It is not genuine by making up extra procedures so you can create a ""gotcha"" moment for some unsuspecting traveler. Luckily for me I have traveled enough to see how this game is played, but it shouldn't be that way.On the flight the planes were fine. The Delta planes had an excellent on board entertainment system, power, and usb connections. The meals were good for airplane food. I enjoyed that there was choice of meals and enjoyed the gnocchis the best for one meal. The stewards were very professional and pleasant and did their best to make the flight enjoyable. Legroom was short on the seats, but that is the standard these days and I didn't want to pay for premium economy. On this factor I give Delta the credit, because you get the service you pay. The Aitalia flight was OK, the staff was again very kind. No inflight entertainment but it was a short flight, I was glad though I had my own battery charger with me."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Great and Consistent Airline,"Delta Airlines has become our go to airline. They are very consistent with their level of service and quality and cleanliness of their aircrafts. It starts out with their customer service which in my experience has always been excellent. They really are a step above the rest of the U.S. carriers. Although a little more expensive in some cases, both in price and mileage program, it is sometimes worth the additional expense.The seat comfort and legroom is likely the same as the other airlines but on most of the aircraft that I have flown on Delta (larger planes) they have the entertainment screens on the back of the chairs in front of you. Lots of movies, tv series and music to choose from. And if by chance they don’t have the system, they have free entertainment wifi you can watch.Delta has become our preferred airline, especially when the price is close to the other airlines."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Great Flight,"One of the best flights in a long time. Snack Packs for sale in addition to the usual beverage/snack service. Into the flight they came through with glasses of water, and later coffee.  Smooth flight, on time and personable crew."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Average is the new mediocre,Not great but a whole lot better than American. There was more seat and leg room than on the American flight from Miami to Santiago; the food was better and more generous and the check-in was far less screwed up
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Great experience,"Very comfortable, smooth flight with great service. Seating in Comfort Plus makes all the difference in the experience with the added room.  Check in and boarding were easy, attendants were cheerful and attentive.  Flight was on time."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Fantastic,We only fly Delta.  We have always had a great experience with them.  Their flight attendants are very nice and professional.  The pilots always gives us updates.  The planes are always well kept and they are good about providing snacks and seeing if we are comfortable.  I feel safe flying with Delta.  I am a scared flier and one time the flight attendant checked on me often when I was traveling alone and she knew I was nervous.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,vacation flights,All flights were on time and seats were very comfortable.  The television for each seat made time move very quickly..  I was able to watch the NFL playoff games live..really appreciated that.
Date of travel: July 2019,50,Consistently excellent service,"Having flown with Delta quite a bit, my July flight to LAX was another example of the consistently excellent service I've come to expect. The app makes every element of travel easy, from check-in to boarding; the service is excellent across the board, from the gate agents to the flight attendants. Another great experience."
Date of travel: January 2020,30,"Getting Home from Fort Myers, Fla.","I did the usual rush to the airport so I would have ample time to make it through TSA. Delta had a skeleton crew taking care of the elitists only and Delta didn't have anyone to wait on regular flyers.  People had to complain for an employee to begrudgingly pick up the phone to call for additional help. Luckily I had time  to spare to board.  Got onboard and sat there.  And sat there.  Finally an announcement was made that the flight was delayed due to ""maintenance problems.""  Being nervous about flying anyway, that wasn't a warm and fuzzy.  Then as 45 minutes passed, I thought about my connecting flight in Detroit.  Finally the flight took off.  No problems, smooth sailing.  Upon landing in Detroit, no measures were taken to let passengers off first that had to bust butt to their next gate to catch a plane.  So there I was behind two old ladies, one in a wheelchair, trying to navigate off the plane and up the ramp.  When I finally reached the concourse there was no one there to answer questions or provide transportation to connecting gates.  Read the monitor they said, it will be fine they said.  I did so.  Being a 100 percent disabled veteran, of course my connecting gate was at the far reaches of the other end of the concourse.  No ride, no help, but we adapt and overcome right?  Hurried the best I could with my back in knots and legs buckling, I made it to my flight as the last person was boarding.  So thats it, my experience wasn't too great and I thought it was poor of them just to dump passengers off with no recourse to get to connecting flights on time.  I made it, but what about the others?  Do better Delta.  Do better."

Although had spent a significant time traveling overseas, I had never been to Bermuda prior to this and i will give it 5 stars indeed.  It is a magical and beautiful place.  Beautiful nature escapes and everyone was very friendly.  Town has some great restaurants, I will post a few reviews.  Flight back was short and uneventful, certainly faster than sailing :)"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Very pleasant flight,"Delta improved a lot. Much better than UAL and AA. First class is pretty comfortable. Even it is a very long flight, approximately 14 hours and 20 minutes, was comfortable and easy flight. Only turbulence was when we were flying over Ecuador line which we are told can not be avoided. Decent food and nice entertainment system. I would enrich more meal choices and I would not save money on this type of first class fare. Overall nice flight and pretty acceptable service. I would definitely repeat it which I will do soon."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Overbooked,"The flight was overbooked, but the offer to take a later flight was very fair $600.   Wish I could have taken advantage of it.  Had to make it home."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Group travel,"We really love this airline, but would appreciate it if they would help make group travel smoother.   We arrived at the airport at 330am for a 535 am flight.  As previously recommended, our group of 18 lined up in alphabetical order.  The desk did not open until 4am.   Checkin took so long that 3 people were told they had to go on a different flight, which they refused.   Since their bags could not be checked, they had to take large suitcases through security and one bag was confiscated because it contained toothpaste.   About half of our group was still in security as we were being paged for the flight.   We arrived late at our connection because of weather issues, but they waited for our group to board.   Most everything turned out okay, thanks to great service of Delta, but the computer system seemed to be very slow.  There must be a better way to do things for a group."

Date of travel: January 2020,40,They've upped their international game,"We used Delta for portions of our January 2020 trip.  We traveled in Main Cabin economy.  We were pleasantly surprised as they have upped their game probably to match other mid east and Europe airlines.  Food, beverage and entertainment service was good for economy.  Seats were also ok again for economy.  I would put them in the mix when looking for future international flights."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Friendly and Punctually,Seats and toilets were quite decent and clean though the 767 aircraft is over 20 years old. The crew was very friendly and keep asking passengers whether they fancy a drink or a snack throughout the entire flight.
n/a,10,Screwed by Delta ,"Day before trip Delta switched my seat within 1st class. 5 minutes before boarding, switched to coach. Gate agent was threatening, rude and condescending refused to discuss how my paid 1st class seat (reserved 2+ months before) could be canceled. He claimed someone paid more for their ticket so they gets priority.  Customer service says not one but 2 passengers were disabled so they needed the seats. Neither looked disabled and I overhead one bragging that she insisted on getting the seat until delta gave in.  Delta won't provide any answers and their compensation has been more failed promises. Delta also can't explain why of the 12 1st class seats... I got moved twice.  Last time I fly delta and I will continue to let everyone know how I wad treated and how Delta refuses to be accountable for their actions."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Gate staff use profanity and treated me so poorly,"Staff is extremely unprofessional, Gate check gentleman swore at my husband, they make no eye contact and are extremely horrible at customer service.Im will not spend any more money on this ridiculously rude and ignorant company and the people they staff.I have never been treated as poorly as the staff at delta have treated me.Any other airline is better then this one"
Date of travel: January 2020,20,Delayed Flight,Unreal.... Delta flight 5744 scheduled to leave Las Vegas at 5:44pm. The plane had not left San Jose as of 5:44pm to arrive in Las Vegas. So Delta knew very well this flight was going to be delayed but did not inform passengers until 5:08pm (1 minute to boarding) that the flight was delayed. RIDICULOUS! Everyone could have had a more comfortable experience and informed loved ones who may be travelling a long way to pick them up. Silicon Valley traffic during commute takes planning. Thanks for failing to communicate Delta.
Date of travel: January 2020,20,Horrible Customer Service and Expense Baggage Check,"The tickets we purchased online would only allow you to pick your seats 24 hours in advance When you log in to the Delta site you are given the option to upgrade your seat for $30.00 per person.  When we boarded the plane and this is no exaggeration there were maybe 35 people on the entire plane if that (Why am I paying to upgrade?) in addition to that 3 pieces of luggage cost $100.00 one way or $200.00 there and back.  In the future, I will avoid Delta Air Lines."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,"Clean, Courteous, & Helpful","Airline travel always has downsides - small seats, limited views, and large crowds. However, we were pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness of the space and the helpfulness of the crew. Definitely one of my more pleasant economy flights."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Delay all the time,Delta is a bad choice. This is our second time to travel with delta. We experienced delay again. We will not go with the airline again.
Date of travel: August 2019,40,Boston to Lisbon round trip on Delta,"I traveled to Portugal in Aug 2019 with my family, along with my husband, two young children and my mother-in-law. First of all, it was great to have the option of flying directly to Lisbon since connections can always add an extra burden when traveling with children. The flight experience itself was pleasant enough. We had a very specific seating preference since we were traveling in a group of five and the airline staff was very accommodating of our needs, and also very kind and engaging with the kids."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,"Travel went smooth, but small seats",The trip went smoothly. The app was really nice to view where my bags at all times. The in-flight entertainment was enjoyable. My only complaint is that the seats are too small
Date of travel: February 2019,10,Delta Adds Cabin Classes at their own discretion,"I booked my tickets to Switzerland 8 months in advance since i travel with a child and i need to coordinate her school vacation.  I booked Delta Comfort -  i called to confirm my seat assignment which was far back.  When i questioned them i was told that they added a cabin class - Delta Premium Comfort.  I said that wasn't offered when i booked. They offered to waive the $300 ticket change fee however i would have to pay the cabin price difference.  I complained i am further back because they added a class.  I said ""so if i pay the $3k to book business and you decide to add first then i  can change but i have to pay the price difference?!""   To add insult to injury they offered to let me DOWNGRADE (waive $300 change fee) BUT I HAVE TO PAY $30 ticket price difference.  SO NOW I CAN PAY THEM TO DOWNGRADE ME!!  For years I flew Delta exclusively - i have 7 international trip in the past 30 months - all personal so i pay for the tickets (not my company).  I paid extra for Delta Comfort because early boarding and close to exit.  Over time the service has declined and is nothing special.  Now that i am aware that they can add cabin classes - which downgrades my tickets class - I'M DONE WITH DELTA."
Date of travel: November 2019,30,To Bogota,This was a very good relaxing flight. The fight attendence were very good with their service. I just wish delta would do better with their selection of food. 2 selection in first class that I could not eat and was glad I bought crackers and the flight attendence gave me fruit/ It was only 4 1/2 hours from Atlanta.
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Uncomfotable seats,"I know i'm flying economy but that's no reason the seats shouldn't have some cushioning and leg room. For the cost of the trip i'd expect more. Additionally, I traveled using one of their vacation packages. Why stick me in Group 2 for boarding?"
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Delta Airlines: A Great Way To Fly,"The flight and everything connected to the flight went well. Take off from TCI took longer than expected, due to the rain. Things moved along at a good pace and had a safe landing in Atlanta, GA.  at exactly 6p."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Terrible Flight Attendants,Flight is not a full flight with several rows of seats empty. I was quickly reminded why I stopped flying Delta. After the doors were closed prior to taxi. Moved to the empty row in front of me. Was removed from the empty row back to the seat behind where two very wide shoulder people have to turn sideways to not be all over each other. The flight attendants laughed that it is very bad to switch seats. Makes absolutely no sense to have rows of empty seats while people are packed like sardines in a can. This is my first experience out of the thousands of flights I have taken that a person could not move to a empty row.
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Trip to Miami,"The flight was good, we made it safely. We did have a layover which I do not prefer. I am actually afraid of flying, so we wish we had a direct flight but, thank God we made it safely.."
Date of travel: January 2020,30,First Class?,First Class was comfortable but it took 45 minutes to be asked if we wanted a drink of any kind.  Economy was already more than half way done with the beverage service.  We paid for first class which is not something we normally spring for but it was a special trip and I want my wife to be comfortable.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Regular international flights on Delta and their Skymiles partners,"I fly frequently to London and to Paris and to Nice, after living in Nice for 11 years before coming back to the US and settling in Palm Springs in 2012.  For domestic flights I always take Delta connecting in Salt Lake City.  It's an easy airport to change in --- far better than Phoenix, Dallas and Tuscon where American and United make changes....  Always flying with Delta or a partner I've accumulated a LOT of Skymiles.  I pay for my tickets and use my Skymiles for my children and grandchildren.  The international flights in particular are extremely comfortable and the staff is excellent, whether in economy, economy comfort, or business.  My most recent one was in November 2019 to India... my next big trips will be to Aruba in March and Australia in June!"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Always reliable and friendly,"Delta is always my first choice.  They have a great on-time record, their people are courteous and friendly, and the planes are clean and well maintained.  Baggage handling and the boarding process have been improved.  Travel nowadays is a major hassle but they do their best to make it less so."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,"Efficient, on time, clean","Easy peasy.  Left on time, got in a little early. Boarding was efficient. Empty middle seat was a blessing. Got a lot of writing done on the flight - great place to tune out and focus. Not many opportunities like a long flight!"
Date of travel: January 2020,30,Don't by basic seats if you want to sit with your minor children!,"I fly Delta because it is reliable.  Now they have their ""basic"" class which boards last, which is fine but this is the first time they told me there was ""no way"" I could sit with my 12 year-old daughter.  We were 20 rows apart.  A family of 5 checked in after me and all the children were spread around the plane (and they were very young kids).  Not sure who had this idea at Delta but it doesn't seem very smart."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Rating is for their performance on a flight which should have been better managed,"We arrived at the airport at 5 am for a 6:50 flight.  Granted a snow storm was predicted in MSP for the afternoon so lots of people arrived early and were trying to get on earlier flights.  I was flying with my granddaughter (14) and could not check her in online, therefore, we were told to wait in the special services line, which took forever.  She did not get TSA Pre therefore we had to wait in the long TSA line.  We finally made it through and Breanna ran to the gate, I ran as fast as I could (given that I am almost 70).  I made it there 7 minutes before departure, the agent told us the gate was ""closed"" and we could not get on.  There were 7 other people that eventually made it to the gate (all before departure time).  Two had the other people in their family already on the flight.  A couple were in tears.  It was all very stressful and frustrating.  Then we were left to fend for ourselves to get to Houston (we really had to be there in the afternoon, and didn't make it until 5pm).  When we got there, my granddaughter's softball bat container was damaged (and yes I had to pay an additional $40 to check the bat because it can't go through TSA) but we did not have enough time to talk with the agent.  Truly I could not understand why the staff could not have held the door open until departure time (I wasn't expecting it to be held beyond that).  The staff knew there were significant problems getting people through TSA.  I thought Delta poorly handled this situation.  We returned to MSP and a few days later I returned to CA via United.  The United rep said they would have held the door until departure time.  And that poor family who had some on the plane and some not...just heartbreaking."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Flight home from Costa Rica,We had First class seats on our Trip home from Costa Rica.  I was really disappointed in the first flight.  We were served our meal and did not get any other service.  We  normally are checked on continuously by the flight attendant and normally have a lot of choices for snacks and drinks.   On our second flight which was only 1 1/2 hours we had constant service.  They brought around snacks several times and continuously asked us if we wanted another drink.  Generally we have really good luck with our flights on Delta.  This one was just a little subpar
Date of travel: January 2020,30,winter vacation,"Flights were fine, no delays.  The comfort plus, as they call it, isn't much more than economy.  More leg room, yes, but seats are same size, and same snacks etc..  I had flown SAS permium this spring and what a difference that was! Bigger seats, a bit elevated snacks, really got what I paid for."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Pretty good flight experience,"Fairly comfortable seats, and a small and quiet section of the plane.  Cabin attendants did a good job.  We were not allowed to use the adjacent first class lavatories, though, which meant a long walk to the very rear of the plane.  Lunch had pretty good entries (wife had steak, and I had pasta) but the rest of the meal was not appealing.  The light lunch before landing had a fairly tasty sandwich, but it was impossible to eat without getting covered with grease.  The roll was too tough to cut with a knife, so you had to pick it up with your hands.  It was a mess and there was no good way to clean us up.  The flight attendant gave us hot towels which helped only partially."
Date of travel: January 2020,30,make sure they tag your strollers at the gate for check!,"We travelled from DTW to CUN for the first time with our 6 month old baby. My husband always flies delta (holds a freq flyer card with them) so I felt confident delta was the right choice for my husband and baby. We brought a stroller and planned to check it at the gate (we told this to the employee at the check in counter). Our stroller was an Uppababy brand and our baby loves it! (naps it in, loves walks). As we checked in with the gate (they had to move our seats around, we were working with them for a while) no one had said anything about our stroller nor did they give us a tag. we  folded and placed the stroller right at the entrance of the plane with all the other strollers. no one was there at that moment. After we arrived I heard the captain ask the stews where the strollers would be found as other families were asking about them. They were not there as we walked off. We were told they would be with our checked luggage at the carousel. (thank goodness i bought my baby carrier or I would have been carrying my baby through customs which we waited in line for almost 2 hours)We finally got the the carousel and no stroller to be found. My husband spoke to the baggage support employees and they had no record of our stroller as there was no tag. After an hour of working with the baggage support we were sent away with a confirmation number (which ended up being incorrect) and a temporary stroller (which the baby did not like unfortunately). This made for an extremely unpleasant first time experience with a baby flying delta. We had not heard anything the next day so my husband attempted calling the number that was provided to us (which was incorrect, he spent an hour online trying to find the right contact number). Once he was in contact with customer support we had learned the confirmation number we had been giving was also incorrect. After straightening out the mistakes that had been made we had found out the stroller had been found. It was shipped to us the next day (which was quick and we were very grateful). However, the snack tray we had purchased for the stroller was missing, as well as a loose screw in the side wheel. We did not receive the snack tray back. All in all, we are grateful the stroller was returned to us in a timely manor, however the difficulties surrounding the incident as well as the missing snack tray had made the experience very stressful and not enjoyable. I was very disappointed in the way the issue was handled and the condition the stroller was in once we received it back."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Flight experience,The seats in Delta are very comfortable. Roomy as airplanes seat can be. WiFi access is also a nice touch. I have decided as I travel a fair bit that Delta will be my only Airline I use. I was lucky on the last leg of my travels to be selected to move up to first class. A first time for me! Wow so nice.
Date of travel: January 2020,40,"On time, smooth experience, nice onboard game/entertainment features","Actually two flights JFK to Houston (Jan 2)  and  Austin to Syracuse (Jan 7)  Both on Delta. Visiting friends and family. To begin traveling, had taken Amtrak from Syracuse to NYP in late January."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,nonstop to HI,"really enjoyed the flight.,  Inflight service was great.  Stewards/stewardess were very helpful and accomadating.  The flight itself was smooth and without major event.  Inflight movies and entertainment was also very good."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,"Good Flight, Helpful Customer Service",The flight was fine. Had to make a last-minute change to reschedule my flight which was seamless thanks to customer service. Will fly again
Date of travel: January 2020,50,"Excellent service, attentive and friendly.","Best flight ever from the staff at the airport to the above wing crew. Attendants were friendly, pleasant and helpful. Thank you Delta for another great flight!!!"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,First Class Service,"With first class comes Sky Priority, which allows you to greatly expedite your departure. The food and service onboard are exceptional"
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Air SAUNA,"I have no doubt that it was my worst flight I´ve ever taken. This fligt takes almost 5 hours and the air conditioner was not working.The crew asked us not to open the curtains, otherwise the sun would keep the aircraft more warm.The company didn´t do anything. I mean: They should have noticed all the passengers before the flight. They didn´t.At least, they should serve more drinks during the flight, because it was too warm. they didn´t.Concluding, they showed to us that they really don´t care about passengers. I hope I never need to fly Delta again. I Don´t recommend this company!!!!! Defnitely"
Date of travel: January 2020,40,we like delta but...,"love their seats and entertainment system.  we took flight from sjd- jfk with stop in Atlanta.  which was delayed, not a problem they text us and we were in lounge so we were comfortable.  there were no water bottles on mine and my husbands seats and no blanketsFA was like , you didn't get a blanket?.  from sjd the to atl   I asked for Prosecco .  sorry we don't have anymore,   really.  im guessing they don't get catered while in cabo.  that stinks.and the FA stated that they are a"" travel company not a bar"".    oh, sweet!!I do like delta but was disappointed on this leg of my trip"
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Better than on-time performance but I sure wish thee were more legroom!,"Kudos to Delta-when the plane was loaded, the door was closed and we departed 30 minutes early...actually arrived at connecting airport (Detroit) 45 minutes early.  This allowed me to make my connecting flight on time.  The second leg was operated by AeroMexico and my rating scores remain the same for their service and operation.  Did not leave early but did arrive at BJX almost 30 minutes early.  That is my first measurement for an airline-on-time service, as that is what you pay for.  Legroom and comfort are next-I never use the in-flight entertainment.  Delta almost hit a home-run on this journey."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Always good experience when flying delta,"In my experiences Delta is consistently a notch above the other airlines. The flight attendants are always nice & well groomed. The planes are clean & the leg room & seats are comfortable. They provide good free entertainment along with snacks & non alcoholic beverages. Even with weather delays or deicing the plane, they are on time."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Better Than Most,"Let's face it. Unless you pay exorbitant fares for First Class, you are essentially in a cattle car. As airlines go, Delta tends to be better than most and this is based on a few trips with them.1. They actually got me to my destination on time, without causing my blood pressure to boil over.2. The entertainment package (on a 2.5 hr trip) was first rate. Lots of movies and TV to choose from3. I didn't overhear any staff being rude to anyone.4. Food?  Nope, but I knew that and brought lunch. The coke and cookie provided were fine.5. We were able to bring carry-on and pick a seat without ridiculous over charges.There are a number of airlines which I will not fly for any reason. Fortunately, Delta is not on that list."
Date of travel: January 2020,30,Not convinced of flying again in Delta,"I find that Delta planes are extremely tiny. The                                                                                   space between seats is claustrophobic. The snacks are terrible and food for purchase is just more snacks. I really don't get it. Even in delta one is too small. Not sure I like it anymore. I also can't understand that they have so many classes of people that board before a normal person, so even if you have some kind of priority or delta comfort, you're still in main cabin to board."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Great Flight Crew,"The only complaint I have is re: comfort.  I upgraded to 'comfort plus'.  There was plenty of leg room, but the seats have no lumbar support.  On a short flight this might have not been a problem.  This flight was over 2 hours, and my back hurt for a day or two afterwards."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Flight from LaGuardia to Fort Myers Airport for winter vacation in Florida,Very nice flight. Left a little late but still arrived on time at Ft. Myers Florida on time. Flight attendant was very professional' Will definitely use them again.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Great Service,"Pilot was friendly, came out of the cockpit to speak with us while boarding and introduced the flight crew. I haven’t seen a pilot out that much personal effort into the passengers before. The flight crew was great, keeping the drinks flowing and the snacks coming. The flight took off on time and landed early."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Great airline,"I love Delta.  I fly for work, a lot.  Typically 3 weeks out of the month and airlines travel is important to me.  Delta is my go to airline.  They are on time consistently.  Much better than the other airlines.  In fact, I have flown them for 6 months and experienced my first real delay with them and that was due to having to wait for deicing.  So I'm not complaining.  I just wish you could get your luggage receipt online when you pay for your luggage online, but you can't.  The Phoenix Sky Harbor ticket lines could be better."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,"Flight from Atlanta, Georgia to Salt Lake City, Utah","We flew from Atlanta to Salt Lake City January 20, 2020.  Our flight itinerary had changed and we still had the same seat numbers, yet this planes seating was different enough that they set you against the wall of the restroom....MISTAKE....what a long flight in an uncomfortable seat that does not recline!  I guess I need to watch that more closely in the future.  I have to take part of the blame, however, because I booked the flight well in advance and Delta sent two itinerary flight changes in the interim.  I simply did not pay close enough attention to the changes or I would have made a change in seating.  Regardless, the crew was accommodating and the flight was otherwise a good  one.  Thank you Delta Airlines"
Date of travel: January 2020,20,Very Inefficient Loading of Plane,"I could not believe how poorly this flight was managed.  The plane was full, and IMHO LAX staff should have anticipated that way too many carry-on would be brought aboard the aircraft.  Did the LAX staff even try to get people to check their carry-on bags?  No.  The net effect was a delayed departure and angry passengers who could not find a place to stow their luggage.  Add to that the fact that way too many travelers violate the carry-on rules, and the aircraft becomes a place of chaos.  All in all a very unpleasant experience."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,vacation on a budget,"My Husband and I can not wait to fly delta again! In the past we have flown delta multiple times weather it is from NY to FL, LAX to NJ and even overseas. Delta never disappoints. Delta always has amazing deals to vacation on a budget, the staff is always friendly and the snacks are awesome!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Holiday to Vegas,"Check In was great at Dublin Airport, Delta Staff at check in were amazing, we were able to check in our hand luggage cases as well, which left us virtually hands free. Airline staff were great also, food, drink, movies on flight were brilliant. Would fly with Delta Airlines again."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,"Flight from Tampa, Florida to Atlanta, Georgia via Delta Airlines","Returning home after a great vacation is always hard to do, but, we boarded Delta Airlines in Tampa , Florida and flew to Atlanta, Georgia on Jan. 20, 2019.  The crew was pleasant and helpful.  The flight was very smooth and we had snacks during the flight.  The seating was adequate and comfortable enough.  Our landing in Atlanta was smooth and uneventful.  The crew, again, thanked us and wished us a very good day upon departure.  We usually fly Delta because of their service."
Date of travel: April 2019,40,"On Time Departure, Early Arrival","Booked flight to Mexico with Delta after reading glowing customer service reviews online. Flight left on time and arrived early in our destination. The staff at the ticketing counter was friendly and the flight attendants were also very accommodating (and bi-lingual!). Flight was also affordable for the distance, with only one layover in Detroit."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Premium Select LHR-ATL,"Delta's relatively new Premium Select class is a success in my view.  We flew to and from London Heathrow, and the difference between PS and Delta One is way less than the cost differential.  It's a small number of seats with attentive service and perks that rival the most upscale Delta offerings.  Boarding is early, seats are comfy, if not lay-down, and as ever, Delta's Flight Attendants are the world's best.  Unless we were taking a really long flight where sleep is a significant issue (and it's not between Atlanta and Heathrow, given the time changes), it would be hard to justify spending more than on Premium Select.  I predict it will sell out early on many flights."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Easy Transcontinental Flight,"Perfect flight! Service was great from pre-boarding to landing. Boarding was done very efficiently, we even took off a few minutes early. The crew was quick to serve all beverages and meals. We received a complimentary meal in Main cabin, which is uncommon in basic economy fares with other airlines that fly this route. Delta continues to exceptionally stand out from its competition."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,The Exit Light Fiasco,"To start my wife and I require assistance to get to boarding gates at airports due to her knees and my COPD. Last year we flew Delta through FLL and found a very irritable Delta staff at D8 gate. We arrived at the gate in wheelchairs and decided to give them up and walk down the ramp to board the aircraft. When pre-boarding began we started down the ramp and was stopped by one of the staff and were refused preboarding because we did not have wheelchairs. This January 26th we were sent to gate D6 to board and the same group of staff were working that corner of the terminal so we knew better than give up our wheelchairs. Delta had put two departing flights in that corner of the terminal that would both board and leave at the same time. When it got close to boarding time naturally both gates filled with passengers to a point where both arriving flights had problems offloading. The staff lined up 18 wheelchairs at our gate including my wife and I. The mob of people was crazy and in a hurry to board as if it was first come first serve boarding. Our gate announced that there would be a 3-hour delay and our new flight time would be 4:00 PM. Delta needed a part for the plane and would have to be flown in from Atlanta to be installed. We along with 200 other passengers inquired about our connecting flights in Atlanta where we were flying too and where the part was coming from. Some were found other flights and some like us had to wait and were given alternate connections. At 4:00 we boarded the plane and the ""EXIT"" sign was installed. Then the crew happened to remember after 3 hours that some of the luggage had to come off of the plane and be sent to other planes which passengers had been given. So for 30 minutes more they unloaded all the luggage, sorted out the few pieces that belonged on other planes and reloaded the remaining luggage. We were finally on our way to ATL. We arrived with 10 minutes to swap to our alternate flights because we had missed our original flights. The Delta staff member in ATL had only sent 12 wheelchairs all for baggage claim. People were scrambling to find wheelchairs but there was no one to push them in Concourse A. We were heading to Concourse E and did not even have wheelchairs on our alternate flight listing. We had now missed our alternate flight to BNA. The attendant at the gate we landed at gave us another alternate flight to BNA via Concourse E. We had now 30 minutes to get to E and no wheelchairs. That's when a young girl found us chairs and after a while found another girl to help push us part of the way. They found another person to replace the other girl and we barely made that flight. Through the whole process, Delta employees just did not care about us. The employee in FLL did not process our assistance request and the Delta employee in ATL did not try to assist with transportation. Next time it will not be Delta that we fly."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Boston direct to Montego Bay,Delta offers direct service to Montego Bay from Boston.  In the summer it is Saturday and in the winter it is Friday. So much easier than having to make (and maybe miss) a connection in the other gateway cities to the Caribbean.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,"Delta seems doggedly determined to deliver and delight with smiles, safety, satisfaction, and service!","Having flown with Delta airlines for many years and for hundreds of thousands of miles, I have seen a steady improvement in their desire to provide customer service and satisfaction.Automatic seating upgrades are given to loyal customers.  Medallion members (frequent flyers) receive special benefits such as shorter lines for check-in, earlier boarding onto airplanes and free checked luggage.Medallion members receive free entrance to the Delta lounges, which are present in many airports, when traveling internationally. I have noticed  a distinct improvement in the quality Delta flight attendants, most of whom are  friendly, attentive, service oriented and professional.In-flight Wi-Fi and Movie/TV/Music entertainment are the “frosting on the cake”.  I always choose Delta Airlines if there are flights where I am going."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,4 FLIGHTS AND ALL ON TIME!,"Made last minute flight bookings for an overnight trip and needed all flights to be on time.  I was thrilled they were!  One layover in Atlanta was a real tight time frame but I did manage to make it to the second plane.  Planes were clean, service was great!"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Go-to Airline!!!,"Flying with Delta is always a wonderful experience from the time I check in my luggage, board the plane, take off, and land.  The workers at the kiosk desk ensure that I have everything I need prior to going through securing I haven’t ran into one person who has had a terrible attitude.  All positive vibes.  The boarding process is smooth and effortless.  Also the flight crew is pleasant and most make their announcements entertaining.  They put safety first, then comfort, and fun and I love their on time arrival.  I highly recommend that you become a Delta Skymiles member and fly Delta!!!  Feel free to ask me any questions."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Perfection is an Understatement,This was the best airline that I have ever been on. Comfortable doesn't fairly sum up the seats that were available in the economy class. The entertainment provided was also a huge plus and I could actually watch what I wanted to watch for a change without having my siblings steal the remote. The temperature was agreeable and it just built up the anticipation of Honolulu altogether. Aloha!
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Best flight,"We took delta airlines from Philadelphia to Orlando for our vacation. Everyone was very nice, from the cleaning staff to the pilots. The airplane pilots let my son have a tour of the flight deck and took a pic with him. Security was great, no issues there. Will definitely fly with them again!"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Early,"Recently leaving Orlando (MCO) International Airport, en route to the Greater Rochester International Airport (ROC), on Delta Airlines, I found both aircraft were clean, both flights had very caring and professional crew members and was early arriving on one flight and on time on the second flight.  After all one hears about today’s airlines, on this day my expectations were exceeded.  Great job."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,No complaints,Flew Delta Airlines with a connection in ATL the 2nd week of January 2020. Both legs of the flight were good with a pretty cool crew on both legs. Flights left and arrived on time. No complaints.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,"A pleasant flight with very cheerful, friendly and helpful Crew Team","The crew greeted us, as we boarded, helped people with their luggage. The coffee was good, they gave you choice of snacks, they did recommend their famous cookies with the coffee. Crew made checks along the flight to see if we needed anything. They thanked us for flying with them when we left. Best of all my luggage was there at the by the time I got to the conveyor."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,English Subtitle Movies,"Far from traditional First Class International or Domestic Flight.  Although, the flight attendant was pleasant, our cabin was not offered beverages once we boarded the flight.  The one good component about this flight was that there was a large selection of entertainment, and a better selection of English subtitle movies.  I had the option to pre-select my meal online prior to the flight.  This was to ensure you received your preferred meal before that option was gone.  Nice flight, but it did not seem like First Class."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Flight,"This was the first international flight I had ever taken it went smoothly, the food was not the best, the atmosphere in the plane was pretty pleasurable, however I slept most of the way over. The cabin staff was fairly pleasant; however, I think a couple of them could have used a nap. All in all it was a very pleasurable flight and I’ll probably do it again it’s sometime in the future."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,always excellent,"I never have a bad flight on Delta and I fly about 125 to 140 flights a year. Sometimes I don't get the upgrades, but Delta is always a first class experience. Their Flight Attendants are great.I decided several years ago to not fly anyone else after a variety of delays and cancelations with the other ""big' guys of the industry"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Delayed flight,"Our flight from Dublin to JFK was delayed an hour and a half which precipitated a five hour layover in JFK… They gave us a little extra liquid amenity on the flight which we didn’t get when we came over but it was still a long flight and the food is not the best, but at least we didn’t starve the flight attendants were pleasant and personally, I thought the landing was superb."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Great customer service,The airplane was normal (old and unimpressive) but the flight attendants were exceptionally attentive. Delta flight attendants make it worthwhile to use this airline.
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Horrible Customer Service experience,The Delta agent was very rude with me and rolled her eyes at me after I asked if I could switch my seat. She tells me “I can’t help you.” I ask if the seat assignments she just did were random considering that is how it seemed and she responds with “No” and just continues to look at her computer not even making eye contact with me. Never flying delta again.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Pleasant 8-hour flight...and great cabin service!,Flight went as advertised with no hiccups or delays. It actually was a pleasant 8-hour flight and we arrived on time. The cabin service was good and the complimentary food was tasty and filling.
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Last time we fly Delta anywhere,"We flew Delta to San Jose Costa Rica on January 10th, with a connection in LA.  We took our son and his wife on a special trip to celebrate his graduation from Physical Therapy training and passing the national exam.  We all flew 1st Class. The short flight from San Jose, CA to LA was OK and we had a 3-hour layover in LAX.  We expected to use the Delta Club . . . but learned that 1st Class passengers were no longer allowed in the club -- and the lady at the desk in the club was snitty about it. We fly 1st class or business class and have never been denied club use by any airline.  This is apparently a new rule to make more money for Delta.On the 6-hour redeye flight to San Jose Costa Rica we expected to sleep, but the seats were not fully reclining nor did they have any leg support -- I tried to sleep and ended up a neck spasm.  They didn't offer breakfast but instead served a truely inedible meal right after takeoff.  My son and his wife are vegetarians and they had forgotten to load their meals, so they gave them a $50 credit on the flight.  luckily they had brought snacks.My wife and I travel internationally multiple times in a year.  She is a former international flight attendant so she knows what to expect.  We both agreed that the flight to Costa Rica and the return flight 10 days later were the worst we had experienced on any airline.  Uncomfortable seats, bad food, they did get our luggage there and back.  Delta will be our last choice from now on."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Wonderful Flight,"Michael, the purser, and the entire team were really fantastic, and provided excellent service. They were professional, friendly, attentive, and helpful!"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Idaho to Key West Before a Princess Cruise,"Love to visit National Parks. Decided to visit Dry Tortugas and Biscayne National Parks prior to our Princess cruise out of Fort Lauderdale. It is ideal to fly directly to Key West the night before your Dry Tortugas tour. Book the Dry Tortugas ferry passage well in advance! Arrive the day before because you'll catch the ferry about 7 AM. The Dry Tortugas tour takes a full day -- returning to Key West about 5:30 PM -- so you'll probably want to stay the night after, too. Delta got us to Key West smoothly and with comfort. The landing strip in Key West is relatively short so expect a ""sudden"" landing and aggressive braking to maintain a safety margin; the captain advised us of this prior to the landing."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Delta Delivers Every. Single. Time.,"I’ve flown with several airlines, and Delta seems to be the only one I get consistently great service with. My original flight got switched, which was fine. The flight was overbooked. I offered up my seat because I had flexible travel. I ended up in first class when I was only supposed to be in Comfort+. That was my first experience in first class, and I must say, I could get spoiled there fast! The staff are always friendly and helpful in any way they can be."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Comfort Plus is a great way to fly,"Comfort Plus gives you extra legroom, priority boarding and a comfortable seat with room to recline. Add to that free snacks and individual video consoles and what used to be a cramped and crowded flight to Florida is now a breeze. The Delta cabin crew really try harder, and the Airbus plane is also new and well laid out."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,THEY RAN OUT OF FOOD,"Not only did they run out of food on the 5 1/2 hour flight to Mexico, but ran out of food again on the 5 1/2 hour trip back.  If they can't do simple math, how can they fly? The flight attendant was extremely rude about it.   I'll ever fly Delta again."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Irresponsible Goof Ups-Mess :(,"Flight from MCO to ATL was delayed twice, went to customer care counter- no one was there. Only self service phones. Called rep - she changed our flights to Minneapolis without telling us with a 20 minutes layover. She charged us one way ticket fare of $596?each without our knowledge or consent. When found out about this short connection & if we miss the connection next flight we would be stuck at Minneapolis for 24 hours. Called back customer care , she said she can not put me back on my original flights. If we go through Atlanta again we will spend night at our own cost, and we will connect next day flight at 1.50 pm for South Bend.When got our Amex Bill found out we were charged $ 1192 for the flights What a messIt’s almost 2/3 weeks and we are struggling to get our money back.I am a Gold Medallion member with Delta What a mess !!!Wondering why Delta hires such unethical employees?Why do they brag about customer service, when they can not care if stranded customers because of Delta’s problems ??? !!!"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Hawaii 5-0,"Flying from Terminal 3 at LAX so got to experience the bus shuttle across the tarmac from T2 to T3 which was a lot of fun.Flight was late in from MSP and so we changed gates which was funny seeing 180 odd people traverse across the Terminal. 737-900ER and although we left late due to the late arrival we were in relatively on time. Due to been medallion members we got emergency exit seats on 20B and 20C. We had just come off a transatlantic flight from LHR and waited 5 hrs at LAX so we were tired, however we did manage to sleep on the flight without reclining the seats as they wouldnt go back very far anyway due to the emergency exit. Service was good and the attendants did come round a couple of times although it took them 90 minutes to come round the first time which i thought strange given that people just want to sleep on this flight. Plane was clean, entertainment decent although we were asleep most of the time. Extra leg room good and even better when its free. Used our drink vouchers to get four free gins as well. Consistently a good product with Delta."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"Austin, TX non-stop to Salt Lake City, UT",The non-stop flight was on-time and we actually arrived early on both legs of the round-trip. The service during the flight was quick and very helpful. The handling of  carry-on luggage was very easy with plenty of space. The room for an additional carry-on item for under the seat in front of you was also very helpful. Watched a free new release movie and enjoyed it. Recommend bringing your own plug in ear buds. The checked luggage was quickly delivered to the baggage claim area. The pricing was extremely competitive as we shopped the rate extensively.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Super!,We were on vacation and flew to Atlanta for our trip to the Bahamas.  This connecting flight was on time and the boarding process was just a little slow.  People had lots of carry on luggage and did not seem to have a clear idea of how to stow it.  The flight left on time and landed 10 minutes early in Nassau.  We were really pleased with The whole flight!
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Not First Class,"Same product different day. Never recognized by any employee for platinum status. Probably 5-6 opportunities to do it. Run out of beverages, how is that possible? Unreliable internet in 2020? Not good"
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Delta one,"The.best.thing.ever!!!I was more excited about my Delta One seat than I was about my trip, and rightfully so. I am ruined now. I don’t ever want to fly again unless I can lay down or completely stand up in my space again. So much room. Excellent arrangement of TV, tray, purse storage. So so nice. I just can’t say enough."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,pampered,"Lovely seats near the bathroom and soft pillow and a light weight fluffy throw blanket.Our seats had the option to convert almost into a bed so we were able to get some good rest.  a delightful way to travel via air.  Very attentive Boston based crew and the take off and landings were very smooth.  We had scrambled eggs, yummy sausage, grilled tomato, fresh pineapple, delightful orange juice.  tasty candied macadamia nuts.The delta Lounge in LA is awesome.  The coffee machine which grinds and b brews fresh Starbucks coffee and transforms it into some many possibilities is something to experience.  Very clean bathrooms both at the Lounge and on board the plane.  they offer a decadent chocolate chip cookie ...  try it you will love it."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,good service,"this was part of a gift from my son so it was a very smooth experience.  My son did some of the leg work to help us check in.  My wife had wheel chair assistance and that was done in a very friendly way.  Seating was smooth, of course we were one of the first people on board.  The one complaint i had was the plane was quite cold by the window seat. There was a great deal of engine noise making it hard to hear the movies.The food and service was good."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,First class is quite nice,"We treated ourselves to first class flights to and from ANC, and it was wonderful- it's a very different world up there in the front of the airplane.  Probably won't do it again due to the price, but for a once-in-a-blue-moon treat, it was great."
Date of travel: January 2020,30,Not so good,"Sat on the plane in JoBurg for 3 hours before they decided they couldn't fly due to staff hour requirements. We had to disembark, wait for luggage and be bussed to a nearby hotel. We didn't get to bed until 2am. We were given breakfast and lunch and could stay in the room until 3 pm. Back to the airport through 3 security checks, recheck luggage go through customs, etc. They got another aircraft and rebooked connections which we nearly missed. Premium economy is only slightly better than economy, very little incline. Service from flight attendants was good. Second time in a year that I have had a major flight cancellation and rebooking from Delta, they are not reliable."
Date of travel: August 2019,30,Delta First Class Underwhelming,"A few friends and decided to upgrade our seats on the flight home from Nashville to Boston. We were surprised to see there wasn't even TVs. It was definitely an older plane, but we were extremely underwhelmed with the amenities of their first class option. It was essentially an extra-room seat."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,The best customer service,"After flying multitudes of airlines both domestic and international I go out of my way to book with Delta because I can count on them to get me to my destination and attend to my needs as a customer. They address concerns rapidly and communicate very well. Thank you Delta, you have a loyal customer."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,wonderful airline,Delta continues to excel and deliver on their promises. Friendly people great service nice plane SAFE and comfortable   Liked in flight entertainment and food service. Our trip out to Phoenix was equally nice.Highly recommended
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Packed flights on schedule,"The plane was packed with every seat taken.  It was the end of the long MLK Holiday weekend.  Overhead bins were crammed.  At the gate, agents encouraged fliers to check in their luggage for free to final destination.  It was a late, overnight flight.  Most passengers slept through the flight.  Flight attendants pushed a trolley of drinks and snacks soon after take off.  We woke up to an announcement that we would land in 30 minutes.The plane was a 757-200, with 3 x 3 seating; the lavatories at the very back.  It is a long hike to a lavatory if you are sitting towards the front.  I had an aisle seat and it was reasonably comfortable.The flight was on time.  It landed at the farthest gate of Terminal 2 at JFK and it was a very long walk to get out of the place. I flew on this flight by encashing my frequent flyer miles with Delta.  I have an American Express affinity card with Delta.  I was 2,500 miles short of getting an award ticket.  Amex advanced those miles to me on condition that I ""repay"" it in four months through purchases on the card.  It was a good deal.  I also was able to select seat of my choice."
Date of travel: January 2020,30,Nice flight with delay,This flight was delayed because of weather.  We were told each delay and the Captain kept us informed as to the delays in take off with de-icing.  The flight to Atlanta was nice with full cabin service.  Maybe a little slow in getting started after we were already delayed one hour but the crew were very accommadating. .
Date of travel: January 2020,30,No service three hour flight,This is the first flight I have been on that should have had cabin service that did not.  The flight attendant said rough air was the reason for their safety.  I have been on flights with a lot of turbulence that serviced the cabin before.  Not sure who made the call for NO service.
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Nice first class,Nice service although the food was a bit spicy-the salad and main course were exceptionally hot spicy and this is from someone who tends to like hot and spicy. This was a luncheon service so there was not too many options. Flight attendants were nice and were available if needed. Nice that there is non-stop service to RDU.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Great Flight,We had a wonderful flight in Delta One with Arden as the purser and Leyda as the flight attendant.  Another wonderful experience on Delta!
Date of travel: January 2020,40,"If you have the money, Delta One is the way to go","We flew Delta One....WOW!!!  It was a long flight and we decided to use our pension check to experience what the upper class enjoys, they are lucky people.  Everything was wonderful....we even got a hot meal and free drinks.  We are use to going coach, so this was VERY special.  Again, if you have the money and are willing  to spend it, try Delta One....also, you get to use the Delta lounge  with this ticket."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Great airline and nice new plane,"Delta is not the cheapest airline, but always the one I chose to fly when I travel for personal reasons because I appreciate the value.  Both the flight to and from Miami from MSP had nice new planes which helps with longer domestic flights. Nice workers, clean plane, efficient loading/unloading process, everything was one time.  My work sometimes makes me fly other domestic airlines and then it reminds me why I pick Delta when I get to make the chose."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,On Time & Good Service,Flew Delta First Class from Los Angeles to Seattle. The flight crew was excellent. The food and complimentary drinks were great. The seats and legroom were comfortable.
Date of travel: January 2020,40,BOS to LAS,"Even though we live in Connecticut and fly out of Hartford (BDL), we flew out of Boston Logan (BOS) due to their non-stop Las Vegas flight options. Our flight was around 10:05am and landed around 1:30pm local time. It was a long flight (~6 hours), but it was worth avoiding a layover and spending all day traveling for a quick weekend trip. Delta Airlines crew was cordial. There were 2 beverage services offered and food was available for purchase."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Prefer Delta,I prefer Delta over any other airline. I have always had great experiences. All flights this time left on time & all went well.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Best of the Legacy Airlines,Delta clearly has figured out that having employees involved in a profit sharing arrangement results in much more dedicated work force.  From stewardesses/stewards and pilots it is now an professional experience flying with Delta.  It is way ahead of United and American.
Date of travel: March 2019,20,Nearly died lol,"The sky king must have been our pilot because we were doing barrel rolls, and not well. I felt sick by the time we landed. We demanded a refund, which they failed to issue."
Date of travel: January 2020,30,Flying Outside the USA On Delta Is Expensive and You're Getting Less!,"We try to fly Delta because they usually have better service than other airlines, but that's changing because of greed. The flight was late leaving so we got in late. delta seems to care less unless you're a business traveler. First-class means you get a bigger seat take it or leave it. To Cancun, Mexico you get a snack and a drink these days. OK, you get a movie too. The crew was very nice and the first-class bathroom was awful. Flying today is the bus of yesterday. We spend months in Mexico and have flown this route first many years, it once was a fun trip."
Date of travel: January 2020,30,"OK Flight, But First Class International Can No Longer Use The Sky Lounges","Delta should be ashamed of themselves! They had record earnings because they charge us the public high prices, but they keep taking away what they had been doing for years and years. My wife and I are retired and travel a great deal we've always traveled first class especially when it truly was first class and when you traveled outside the country you were able to use the Sky Lounges, well not anymore.  We're not business travelers, but flying in economy with the seats getting smaller all the time we are willing to pay extra for the room and when we traveled outside the USA the use of the Sky Lounges. It's one thing if you're not making money, but you gave your employees 2 months salary (bonus) to help with your taxes because you made so much more profit than you projected. Shame on you Mr. CEO. We're just leisure travels and you could care less about us."
Date of travel: February 2019,10,Ms,"My flight actually was in January 25, but January is not listed as it is probably way behind. So is my damagged luggage case as it is pending since them. One year of torture with this company, additional account opened, family membwers embartesed numerous times on keep being sent back as payment was not processed, x numbera of calla from oversea, precious breaks from working on a cruise ship spent on a phone trying to resolve a single damgged luggage case, a home bank which was put into investigation as it was told that payment was settled, but actually it was not. Disgrace.  This is my anniversary of a night mare with Delta airlines. All of this cannot be refunded in 10 lives. One does not know what to do anymore in order to close a case."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Mechanical failure delta put us in all inclusive resort for night and put us on next plane out next day,"Flight was cancelled coming home from pvr, Delta jumped on it right away and we were brought to an all inclusive resort for night free of charge. I was impressed Delta was able to get 158 people situated in hotels for a night within 1 hour of cancellation."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Flight to KY and back,"I upgraded to First class for the first time, the cost jump from Delta-plus was small.  If you are on a medium size plane you get nicer seats and more space. In the little jets the seats are bigger but not as big... and the electronic entertainment doesn't always work. It would be nice if WiFi was included as part of the First Class package."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Return home,"The return flight from California to Indiana reinforced the positive experience I had flying to California. It must have been a couple of years since I flew Delta, but the seat area in economy seems more generous! No more No Smoking signs and the tv on the seatback had the latest movies. The free snacks and drinks were still limited. The service was still friendly and efficient. I plan to take Delta on my next flight."
Date of travel: April 2019,50,The Only Way to Fly,"Western Airlines, which was taken over by Delta Airlines, had the motto ""The Only Way to Fly."" And that has always been my experience with Delta, as it was with Western Airlines. Delta is who I check out first for domestic and international travel as the service and comfort is always good. Virgin Atlantic has terrific service as well, and is listed on Delta's flight schedules to Europe."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Delta is Horrible,Worst airline on earth. Horrible customer service. They lie and steal from their customers.  Do not fly Delta.
Date of travel: January 2020,40,All worked out as planned but...,"Our flights were great.  We had a connection both ways and three of four of our flights were operated by Westjet.  We love westjet so that worked for us.  Delta was good too however one complaint.  When landing at JFK for our connection home we asked the agent when we got off where our gate would be and he looked it up and said ""I think Terminal 1"".  I didn't like that answer but smiled and figured I would check with someone else.  A few steps away thankfully I got a text notification saying we were departing in Terminal 4.  I went back to the agent and he was like oh well you have to take a shuttle over there.  Good thing I checked as that could have been a disaster.   As it was we barely had time to grab a bite of food and go to the washroom before being called to board.  Other than that the flight was great and we had no issues."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Short Flight from IND to ROC,if you are going to ROC from IND go through Detroit.  Better connections and less layover.  Plus you don't have to deal with the ATL airport.  Flights are short and if in business or higher you will get drinks and a snack.  Several times in main the flight attendants walk through with a bottle of water and offer only water.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Fun Flight Attendant,"Flying home from NYC is always dreadful--the thought of returning to work and exhausted from a few days in the city.  Not to worry, the most amazIng flight attendant made our trip fun.  She quickly realized we were a group on a ""mom trip"" and reminded us she had a ""drawer of alcohol"" and plenty of sweet treats.  I felt like I made a friend on the flight home.  (The attendant explained she did not work for Delta, but for an affiliate flying the Delta plane--so shout out to the affiliate for hiring someone with an effervescent personality)"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Easy trip,"Except for having to be at the airport three hours ahead, things went extremely well. The flights were on time. The baggage arrived safely. I tried my new air flight adapter for my AirPods and it worked well. The crew were very friendly and the captain kept us well informed. Enjoyed the flights."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Delta is getting better,"They helped me change my flight without a fee, after the other flight was changed by them as it should be.   The flight itself was comfortable with polite people helping us and serving us.   The Lounge at LAX is way too crowded, the food was fresh with good choices getting better all the time it seems, besides not having enough room."
n/a,10,Delta economy+ seats worse than standard seat on Southwest,I paid $89 for a seat with extra legroom and it's smaller than a standard seat on Southwest.  And the Wi-Fi costs more too.  Add to that checked checked bag fees and I doubt I will ever fly Delta again when I I have a choice.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,"Great Flight, what you expect from Delta","Excellent service both on the puddle jumper to Detroit and on to LA.  Service was quite good, stewardess very helpful in determining our connecting gate and how to get to it. Flight from Detroit to LA excellent.  Service quite nice. We were lucky, we had an empty middle seat which gave us plenty of room."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Why pay for cable?,"Delta has always been a solid airline, in my opinion. This was a short flight so economy was fine and not nearly as uncomfortable as other economy seats in which I've been seated. That being said, Delta's Comfort Plus is definitely worth it if you have a lengthy flight. Everything was on or close to schedule, the flight crew was pleasant enough, and the in flight magazine actually had an untouched crossword puzzle in it. But the personal in flight entertainment was great. I suppose most airlines offer as much, but I really had to weigh my options before deciding which movie to watch. Possible tip: don't be so quick to pay for a checked bag. On both legs of the flight, they offered to gate check carry-ons for free. I was going to have to wait for others to get checked bags anyway, and, this way, I didn't have to fight with other passengers who think their trans-Atlantic steamer trunks are carry-on bags."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,"No problems, no delays!",No problems with the flight.  Ground staff easily agreed to let us board early (knee and sciatica issues).   They never hassle me.  Even TSA was good to work with.
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Annoying weight limits and extra costs...,"We were flying back to LA from a week in Mexico.  We got to the airport and had packed everything into two suitcases (for 4 people) and did the online check in and paid for the baggage and then get to the bag drop and they say that each bag is 2 kg's overweight and we need to remove 2 kg's from each bag.  Luckily we had a spare bag and had to (on the floor) remove 2 kg's from each bag and put them in another bag and then pay the extra $30 USD for the third bag.  Wasn't impressed.  We weren't trying to save money, we were trying to make travelling easier with 2 young kids and 2 suitcases as opposed for a 3rd one which makes things more awkward to manage.  The flight itself was okay, nothing spectacular.We also had the gate changed at the last minute with no notification and then the gate next door was boarding to another city in America.  Was very confusing even for a well seasoned traveller."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,"Save your money, time, and Sanity!!","Where do I even start with this review?!We just returned from our week long vacation in Riviera Maya where we got married.  There was a group of 20 of us.  My sister and her boyfriend live in Vegas, so she was flying to MSP via spirit Airline to meet up with us and then she was going to fly delta with our group.   Due to an attendant not calling their gate through spirit, they missed their flight while sitting in the airport along with several other people.  LiThey went to the Delta desk in Vegas to see if they could arrange that.  Li told that they would need to call the MSP delta desk to arrange that as they were not ab Ok le too.  They were given the Delta MSP number and gave it a call.  At first they were told that they couldn’t help them because they were a private reservation through delta vacations (a travel agent booked us).  They called again and then were told that they could not put them on a later flight, that they would both need to buy new tickets ($800 a piece, so $1600 total).  They were told their original delta vacations package that they paid $5000 dollars for, would be cancelled.  Since that was an outrageous amount to pay, they asked if they could book a cheaper airline to Riviera Maya, and then fly their original booking through delta vacations ( THAT THEY ALREADY PAID FOR) back home with the rest of the group.  They were told by the delta rep that as soon as they miss the first flight, EVERYTHING IS CANCELLED.  UMMM NO! They paid for those seats!! After all night and day one and half of day 2 of vacation ruined, a delta rep called my sister after she sent in a review and swung her a deal for a $500 flight there and allowed her to ride back on her original booking.  Her boyfriend on the other hand was being sent back and forth and after 3 days of fighting with delta, a rep called and gave him a free flight out.  Spirit refunded their missed flight because it was on them.  They should have been arranged on a later delta flight out as it was not their fault- except delta didn’t care because it was a spirit flight they missed.  They finally got the flights figured out, but then they had to re- add her boyfriend to the resort room.  They called the resort and they stated that they could do that for free since it was already paid, but they needed the ok from delta vacations.  Delta vacations said no, they have to pay an extra $300 to be added to the room (THAT THEY ALREADY PAID FOR) so our travel agencies manager paid out of her OWN POCKET because delta vacations wouldn’t budge and they felt horrible for the situation.  Ridiculous!Now onto all of MY ISSUES.  My husband and I have a 1 year old son riding as a lap infant.  Our travel agent said he flies free on our lap, we just have to pay taxes on his seat. Great, so we did.  We get to the airport the morning of our flight on January 14th in Fargo ND, and the delta rep tried telling us we needed to buy him a seat for $1000!!!!.  After arguing for 10 minutes she agreed and said we just needed to pay the taxes on his ticket.  I already paid them, but we were late now to get through security so I paid them AGAIN and I emailed my travel agent to take care of getting my money refunded.  We again were told we needed to pay the taxes when we got to the MSP airport!!!! What the hell delta.  We told them no and told them what we had already gone through and they let us into our next flight.We arrive at our resort in Riviera maya Mexico and meet with the delta vacations rep to make sure our transport back to the airport at the end of our vacation was all set.  We get there and the rep had us on several different flights and transfers ( most importantly, had us separated from our son, who we booked with his grandparents so we could get upgraded for our wedding at the resort).  After emailing my travel agent and talking the the resort rep, they figured it out and all was good.Now leaving the airport, everyone had their transfers from the resort confirmed with delta vacations , however when our transport van showed up, wouldn’t you know, one of our members names wasn’t ON THE LIST!  So after arguing with the transport driver for 15 minutes, the resort bellman spoke with him and we were all finally let on the transfer bus.When we arrived at the Fargo airport on the 21st, our stroller for our son which we had been checking at the gate each time, the wheel AND the brakes are broken.  The wheel is jacked and doesn’t work anymore, brakes don’t work at all.  If it was a $25 stroller I wouldnt care, but this is a several hundred dollar Chicco jogging stroller and I’m very upset.I spent 3-4 of my vacation/ wedding  days figuring out deltas mess, dealing with crap I shouldn’t have had too.  I also have a broken stroller on top of it.  I ALWAYS fly delta airlines and I have never been so unimpressed and UPSET about our service as I have been this time.  I understand having policies in place, but when it’s from a circumstance completely out of a passengers hands, delta should accommodate.  Especially considering the amount of money my entire group of 20 paid to use their service and we are ALL VERY UNIMPRESSED.  We will definitely never be booking a delta vacation package ever again and will be looking into American Airlines for our next vacation.I want to thank a few people that tried helping to the best of their ability during this whole mess— Lisa and Cindy at travel travel in Fargo ND, and Carlos from delta vacations transport service at the Barcelo maya grand resort.  Without the three of them,  it would have been a lot more awful of a situation."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Solid coach experience,"Flight from New York LaGuardia to Tampa on a Monday afternoon.  Totally full airplane.  The LaGuardia terminal has seen better days, but hopefully the massive project to re-do it will make it better; right now, it's just a construction zone.  Boarding was a little chaotic but did get done in-time.  Staff were polite.The flight was operated by an A320.  The interior was clean.  Appreciated the large overhead bins that allowed bags to be stowed on their side.  Seat in ""Comfort +"" had good legroom for an economy seat, and I appreciated the plug, USB plug, and in-flight entertainment.  Enhanced snack service from a basket.  Flight attendant service not particularly memorable, but polite and timely.Overall, a solid coach experience."
n/a,50,Always fly Delta,"Flying from South Africa to the US can be an excruciating experience. My husband and I fly to the States once a year for marketing purposes. We have never regretted choosing Delta Airlines for this long flight. It's always clean & comfortable, the fligh attendants are always so kind & patient, and we even enjoy the food. On our recent flight to the States, we had to make a quick stop, but even doing that didn't bother us since we're just always so happy with this airline. Whenever someone tells us that they're planning a trip to South Africa/USA we ALWAYS suggest flying Delta!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,House Closing,Traveled to Florida to close on a house.  The flight was peaceful and stress free. Airplane was new and clean. The crew were great as always.
Date of travel: January 2020,20,"Flight ok, but luggage was soaked","When we got to our hotel after our long flights, all the clothes 2 suitcases were sopping wet! Called Delta and they did not care. Very disappointing"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,great flight to europe,"the planes were on time, clean including the restrooms.  the food was great. we had a wonderful purser and remainder flight attendants on the flight out. he was always with a smile and a laugh for everyone. the seats on delta business are comfortable but  my 6""4 husband still is claustrophobic and has trouble with space for his legs."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Disappointed that extremely slow baggage drop caused missed flight,"Flight was scheduled for a Saturday afternoon, after New Years.  Arrived at airport 90 min pre-flight, turned in rental car, and waited more than 20 minutes for the shuttle from car garage to terminal.  (The shuttle wasn't brand-specific, it was the shuttle for all car companies, from the FLL garage to Departures.)  I ALREADY had checked in and had boarding pass, so I entered the baggage-drop line inside (60 minutes pre-flight).  The airport was crowded, and the line didn't move for a very long time.  Delta did not have any employees surveying the line to look for potential flight misses, or to advise customers on other options.  I watched constantly for an employee to help me.  People were queued in front of me, and behind me. There was nobody I could ask for help.  At 45 minutes pre-flight, the wife of the married couple behind me left her luggage w/ husband and left the queue to seek help.  She came back w/ a Delta employee who escorted them out of the queue to drop their luggage & make their flight.  I don't know how much money they gave the Delta employee.  While the Delta employee was taking their bags, I asked him if he would also help me.  He said no, he wouldn't.  He said at 45 minutes, it was too late for me to make my flight.  So I remained trapped in the queue.  At 40 minutes preflight i saw him walking again, and again asked him if he would help me, and I showed him I already had my boarding pass and just needed to drop my bags.  He said no, he couldn't help me.  I didn't have any cash on my to give him.  And that is how I will always remember Delta... DELTA WILL HELP CERTAIN CUSTOMERS, BUT WON'T HELP OTHERS.  Delta was understaffed.  When I got to the front of the queue, it was 25 minutes pre-flight.  I had waited in the baggage-drop line for 35 minutes.  The attendant was apologetic that no employee had helped me in line, and she found me a flight departing 32 HOURS LATER, FROM A DIFFERENT AIRPORT 1 hour away.  I had to pay a large amount of money for the price difference.  I've learned a lesson about flying on the Saturday after New Years', and I've also learned to never fly with Delta because they can't provide adequate service during busy times, they treat rich customers better than they treat avg people, and they didn't accept any fault for their slow service and lack of line attendants, which caused myself and other Delta customers to miss flights."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Worst flight experience I can remember,"My group ranged from A young teen to my 6'4"" husband. While he was barely able to sit with his knees pointed forward anyway, both international flights had seats pushed back so that was not even an option. He was unable to use his tray table without his leg in the aisle and space of the adjoining seat. If he tried, it would be diagonal instead of flat. The 1.5hr flight to and from Italy had more space, and more upfront and aware staff. Even my 5'2"" daughter was unable to sleep. In flight entertainment was mostly old, while one AUX jack crackled and cut out audio.While I do not have issues with kids on planes, the degree to which irresponsible parents were catered to was appalling.A couple had two kids under 3, who they did not have seats for. The steward quickly reseated the woman in front if us in order to give them an extra seat. The parents put on sleep masks, headphones, and put their seats back. Their kids screamed, no response. Their kid climbed over the seat and put their hands on my face, nothing. Their kid poured water on my husband's knee, their kid grabbed my iPad... No help. When meal service came around during the 30-45 min the kid did sleep, the dad was woken up and asked if he wanted meals set aside for his kids. He said no. Steward offered again, he said no. Third try he said yes. A couple hours pass, he asks for the food. It's been given away. He was offered an alternative, as well as the additional flight meal, but he declined. Took snacks, which they ground into the carpet.The steward gave him two flight credits for the trouble.I've had a viral bug for a week and a half since returning. My neck is messed up badly enough that I've made a chiropractor appointment, something I didn't even have a doctor for until now.I don't know if the seat sizing being worse than flights around 1/10th of the length is to get people to pay for business class. But after paying 3k total to get to Italy, I'm confident I will warn anyone planning a trip - DO NOT FLY ANYTHING MANAGED BY DELTA. It is not worth having your knees slammed into and the flu after a random kid puts their hands on your mouth."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,"Delta is just fine.  Nothing extraordinary, but always pretty good.","I went for a weekend trip to Chicago and took a Delta flight round trip.  Easy check in, nothing out of the ordinary with the flight.  I wish they had better snacks on Delta though."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Home from a Cruise,"Our cruise line arranged our air, Delta does nicely on international flights. The Delta personnel in the terminal were very professional & helpful, we saw them all again @ the gate... I think because of this there were no surprises."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Flight from Miami to Boston,"Overall I was happy with my Delta flight from Miami to Boston. The check-in process seemed a bit unorganized; 15-20 passengers (including myself) ended up having to check carry-on luggage due to lack of room on the flight. However we got to our destination on time, the flight attendants were friendly and the in-flight entertainment was nice."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Great trip,"Love Delta. I took a ""cheaper"" airline out to Denver and will never do that again. . Delta is the way to fly. Seats very comfortable, love having free movies, tv and even the snacks.  Being comfortable and watching a movie makes the time fly by on a longer trip.Thank you Delta !!!"
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Generally good flight,"Delta does an OK job on this flight. Like all airline now, the seats are too small, leg room too little. Since all airlines are the same in those characteristics, Delta gets rated very good. The soft drinks and snacks were acceptable. It would be nice if some airline took the lead in bringing back free meals."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Terrible service,"First time I’ve flown with Delta and it’s certainly the last! We’d reserved our seats on booking, however the aircraft had changed so we’d been split up. I asked at check in if this could be sorted and was told to check at the boarding gate, only to find that everyone had been moved so a huge crowd of passengers were there attempting to have their seats rearranged. Eventually after being surrounded by chaos our seats were returned to the original booking, much to our relief. Thinking that things would improve from that point was a mistake! The two hostesses (of senior years) were incredibly rude. Absolutely zero pleasantries. One came around with a dish of snacks (despite it being a 6 hour flight, you do not receive an inflight meal), snacks comprise of tiny bags of nuts or dried fruit, cheeselets or a banana. The passenger to my right was a lovely chap and we both insisted the other choose first, to which the hostess said very tersely ‘one of you just choose!’ We were not told that our televisions were hidden in the seat arm as we were at the front of the row. The main memory I will take from the experience is that of the organised chaos and the outright rudeness of the staff, if you have options, don’t choose Delta!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Hawaii 2019,"We connected on Delta through Detroit and went non-stop to Honolulu.  The plane appeared newer and was quite comfortable; it was an Airbus 330.  The legroom seemed reasonably spacious for the economy section as we did not feel cramped with knees abutting the seat in front of you.  Overhead space was plentiful, cabin was very clean, although the temperature was very cool the first half of the trip.  Pilots were able to get us there an hour early!  Flight crew was very friendly and helpful- all around it was a great experience."
Date of travel: January 2020,30,Poor customer service in Atlanta,"The flight from Salt Lake City to Atlanta was delayed allegedly due to weather issues. We were so late most of us missed our connecting flights.  There was little to no explanation or instructions from the flight crew on what to do when we got to Atlanta. We all ended up in a line that had Hundreds of people in it to wait for 2-3 customer service reps. I was rebooked automatically on a flight to Syracuse  for 24 hours later but no one told me that until I waited in line.  Luckily I was able to find a hotel room, at my own expense (due to the alleged weather conditions there was no reimbursement) with no luggage except what I had in my hand. I found the workers in the airport to be pretty rude, certainly Not friendly. Their app gave no information either."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Pleasant and comfortable flight,The flight was smooth and the attendants were overly friendly and attentive.  The plane was clean and movies new.  Overall another great experience
Date of travel: January 2020,40,I'd highly recommend Korean Air for any long flight.,"The comfort: When you arrive to your seat, there is an individually packed pillow, blanket, and headphones waiting for you. The pillow is to-be expected. Small but does the job. The blanket was thicker and softer than expected which I was very pleased with. The temperature stayed comfortable throughout flights but when sleeping it was a nice comfort to drape over your body. The seats reclined enough, and the legroom was adequate without paying for extra space. Food & Drink: I am a lover of Korean food, so I was delighted that Bibimbap was on the menu. It was good enough. It included gochujung in a small toothpaste looking tube which I thought was funny. There were two other options which didn't sound interesting to me. That being said, I wish there was a picture of the options or a note as to what was available in a magazine or something in the front pocket of your seat. I knew that beer and wine were complementary from doing my previous research on the airline, but it would have been nice to see what else was available. I would have liked (and been happy to pay for) a vodka tonic, but I didn't see any literature of options and didn't care enough to ask. If at any point you were hungry (which I was a couple times) you could press the call button and ask for snacks. They had a sweet-salty snack mix and a cup of ramen noodles. Both of which I enjoyed. Entertainment: Each seat had their own personal touch TV. It had your standard options of tv, movies, games, etc.. I thought the movies were sufficient but was disappointed by the lack of standard American tv shows. There also wasn't wi-fi available which I was disappointed about"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Flight to New York,"Flight was good, good variety of entertainment options on the info screen. Usual refreshments but we had to purchase the in-flight headphones. Usually you can get a pair for free which we did on the way back to Atlanta from New York?"
Date of travel: January 2020,20,Indifferent Service,"Orlando to New York on an Airbus 321 in January 2020.  There was a 3.5 hour delay due to air traffic control in New York.  That was not Delta's fault, although the delay was frustrating.What was frustrating was the poor service.  At Orlando, there was only one agent working the ""Sky Priority"" lane.  The wait was thus well over 20 minutes, particularly on a day with several operational delays and rebookings.  The agent was nice and kept begging for assistance from her colleagues, but none came.The staff in the SkyClub in Orlando was a mixed bag.  The reception staff were nice but the bartender was a sarcastic jerk.  The SkyClub is straight out of the 1990s and in bad need of renovation.After the long delay it appeared the cabin crew were just ready to be done.  Service throughout the flight was indifferent.  A meal was quickly served in first class and then the flight attendant took his seat after clearing trays and, across the 2.5 hour flight, offered no refills, etc.  He was going through the motions.An experience well below of what Delta is capable."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,DONE with Delta!!!,"Sat on the tarmac in Omaha IN the plane for 3 hours!!!!! With little communication from Delta. Finally pilot came on and said they had detected a “problem” but they had a part being flown in from St Louis and a mechanic from Memphis  and the plane would be fixed immediately. WHAT- no one available at that airport to fix an airplane and Delta did not have another plane for us .  Our 6:30 am flight left at 2:30 that afternoon    Everyone who had connecting flights obviously missed them and we arrived at our destination at 8 pm -then needing to drive another hour in the dark to our hotel.  Missed an entire day of our vacation.   This happened to us last year on a trip to Jamaica where they changed planes on us 3 times in Atlanta -the DELTA HUB and we arrived 8 hours later than planned,  we were on the plane-mechanical problem detected ( after sitting there for an hour watching delta people run up and down the aisle) unloaded the plane as they said they were going to get us a different plane. Waited 3 hours  Reloaded the plane- waited another hour only to hear the  pilot say the plane they gave us was tagged to be repaired so unloaded a full plane again- waited 3 hours for a new plane"
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Overall good experience,"Friendly & courteous customer service at the check in counter, boarding gate and in flight, timeliness of departure and arrival of the flight, timeliness of baggage arrival at the belt in Atlanta are the reasons for my positive rating. The only reason as to why I did not give it a 5 star rating was the legroom was not adequate for an international flight. The seat comfort could have been certainly better. Would still certainly recommend flying this leg of the trip to any traveler."
Date of travel: March 2019,30,Delta has gone downhill,"It seems like the last few years that we have been flying Delta they have been going downhill. There have been numerous flight delays, switching out of flights, etc, so we were surprised that this time the flight left on time. The seating isn’t ideal in economy, and very squishy, particularly the plane we were on. This flight there was some turbulence so service took quite awhile. That’s not their fault, but it does make for a less pleasant flight."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Delta Flight - Red Eye to Paris,"I took the 5:00pm Delta flight from Salt Lake City that lands in Paris at 11:00am their time.  Red eye flights are always hard, but this flight is by far the best experience I had on an international flight.  The in flight entertainment is great, the flight attendants are very helpful & nice.  Delta adds extra things like hot towels & a welcome cocktail that make the experience even better.  The food is surprisingly good for being airplane food as well. I certainly never felt hungry! I definitely recommend Delta for your international flight, they do an excellent job."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,"Flight was on time, movie entertainment choices were good. Treats were good as well! Flight attendants were wonderful!","Check in was easy and uneventful. retrieving our baggage from baggage claim was okay for two of us. One of our party members couldn't find her baggage around the carousel, but found her luggage among someone else's belongings . . ."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Miserable flight attendant,"Not a bad flight per se, the plane is fine, the food was ok but dear god the flight attendant seemed to have been scrapped from the bottom of the barrel.It is not easy to have a smile on your face all the time but come on I have not witness this level of arrogance and miserableness from people who are supposed to have trained to deal with customers."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,My flight was from Atlanta to New York on January 5. It was a great flight.,The flight was good considering I was getting over an inner ear infection.  Having wi-fi on the trip where I could watch a movie took my mine off of what I had experience 6 days before my flight.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,"Good Airline, if you don’t mind to stop in Atlanta","Great flights, all on time, plane was almost new, good service onboard, only thing if you are an Platinum AMEX  member, Delta only allow one person free of charge at their Delta Sky Club in Austin, everywhere else with that kind of card you can bring at least one companion free of charge."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,DELTA-Korean Air--Boston to Bangkok,"My wife and I took a lovely long trip from Boston to Bangkok with a layover at SEOUL-INCHEON. Overall the 13 hour flight was OK, as the staff made you feel as comfortable and taken care of as possible. From the moment we stepped on the plan it was clear the friendliness, cleanliness, overall vibe from the plan made you feel as if this 13 hour flight wouldn't be so bad after all.  What I enjoyed the most was solid inflight entertainment as the plane had great TV, movies, and music options. Additionally, the fact you can drink beer and wine for free all flight was a plus as well as the authentic meals they had prepared for the long haul. Since we were connecting in Korea we were on the DELTA-KOREAN AIR line so the food offering had a Koran twist with a solid bibimbap meal and other delicious Korean foods and also they had tradition American offerings as well. Another plus was the unlimited amounts of water, soft drinks, coffee/tea you could drink the staff came around a few times an hour to ensure you had what you needed. Overall the plane was super roomy and had a lot of space to get up and walk around if need be. There are spaces near the bathroom/back of plane you can get up to stretch your legs which was great, there were at least 5 separate times where I was able to stand up for a half hour at a time to relax, stretch the legs, walk around which was the most important thing for me. At the end of the day we made it from point A to point B and were overall happy with the long Journey from the US to Bangkok. Lastly I do want to mention if you have the chance to connect in SEOUL-INCHEON deff do it as it was one of the best airports I ever been to especially for a layover with great restaurants/food options, good shopping, and most important an area to take a shower. They had personal shower rooms with a toilet and glass shower.   Unreal water pressure, very clean, free towels and it is such a refresh when you are connecting after or before a long flight.  All around solid trip on DELTA-Korean air"
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Great way to start Cruise,Flight to cruise port was on time and very nice.  Trip back was terrible.  5 hr flight delay in Orlando.  No information.  Finally booked another flight home.
n/a,50,What a great airline!,"As a family we travel three times a year.  Delta overall is fantastic!  The service is second to none.  On time, clean and friendly.  And the in flight entertainment is the best we have experienced.We will definitely us them again.  Much better than most."
Date of travel: January 2020,30,Miserable New Years Day in CDMX Airport,When one of the engines started to smoke and smell while we were pulling away from the gate a passenger in the exit row pulled the emergency door open and all hell broke loose.  I don't know why the passenger didn't immediately alert the crew first as it really wasn't necessary to open the door.  The crew handled it well and obviously we all had to get off the plane and wait for over 10 hours for another one!  They weren't very good in predicting the departure time and it kept getting bumped so instead of getting home at 3PM as scheduled we didn't get home till 1AM!  Delta gave us 20K miles and for those without an account they gave them Delta Choice gift card for $200 dollars.  Wasn't much but at least something for ruining New Years Day!!
Date of travel: October 2019,50,We almost always go with Delta!,"My husband and I almost always fly Delta and these flights did not disappoint. This flight was the first one I've taken since Comfort+ was introduced. From what I noticed, there's not a significant difference between main and comfort+ other than the snacks they get and service order. There may be more differences however. I just didn't see any.Delta very rarely cancels their flights from my experience and doesn't give you the run-around like many other airlines do, like American (I've had many disappointing experiences with them). Staff is always friendly and accommodating. I also feel like Delta is upfront about any charges you may have. They are sometimes more expensive but they don't nickel and dime you quite as much as other airlines seem to (*cough* Spirit *cough*).Overall, we love Delta and will continue to use them as our preferred airline to fly!"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,☆☆☆☆☆,"Delta has a great reputation for a reason!  We recently flew Delta for our trip to Florida to leave on a cruise.  Their crew is always friendly, their pilots know what they are doing and even with the most turbulent flight I have ever experienced (flying over Kansas City during a storm) I felt safe.  Delta is typically a bit more expensive but you definitely get what you pay for! ☆☆☆☆☆"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,We always flyvDelta,We always get great service from a Delta.  We were upgraded on the first flight but not the last one.  We even flew on a miles ticket.
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Good Fights - Hectic Atlanta Layover,"Flights were great.  Economy - well, you know - cramped, but no surprise.  Only issue was Atlanta layover.  Large airport - short time between flights, long walk.  Made it, but older fliers might be stressed worrying.  Trams very helpful getting to correct concourse."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Delta Airlines,"Excellent and pampering service!Flight left right on time and the stewardesses were kind, helpful and charming. Almost felt like flying first class!"
Date of travel: July 2019,40,Good major airline,"I think Delta is probably the best of the major airlines. They have priority boarding for families, which is helpful; many low-cost airlines do not offer this. In addition, their terminals tend to be nicer than average."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,"Low Quality, older planes, over priced!","We took 4 planes from Delta on our trip. All was book for extra pricing under ""Premium Economy""  2 planes were local short run planes, cramped, uncomfortable, and no notice of any upgrades for tickets purchased. Next plane was larger and longer flight more live-able but not what expected. Not happy with Delta!!! first and last time that I would use this airline."
Date of travel: August 2019,30,Good airline to fly,"Delta Airline lines good to fly their in flight is good,check in service is also good.Air hostess are friendly."
Date of travel: January 2020,30,Better than any other us carrier,It’s my first time to fly by delta international. Upgrade comport plus. Seat was little bit problem. Reclining was not working. Staff was not so bad. Also not so kind. But thats all right. Departure and arrived on time.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Great airline ,"I haven’t used this airline for over 15 years and I was very happy with the service, movie selection, beverages and meals! Recommended"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Non stop to JFK Arrived Early!,"Don't usually fly Delta, but only nonstop I could get to NYC.  Great service, even a meal was included.  We arrived early.  Flight back to SFO also arrived early, and again great service and a meal"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,"Good Flight, Poor Weather","On the day of our flight, snow was forecast for Boston (our destination).  Delta gave us a back-up reservation for the next day.  Fortunately, it was not needed.At the time of boarding, we were upgraded to first class (Million Miler perk).Service was excellent and meal appropirate for mid-afternoon.Bags reached the carousel before we did and we were away from the airport in ~20 minutes.Delta continues to be a well run air line."
n/a,50,Like a dream,"This was more than other airlines have used me to expect on domestic flights, so I was delighted. The fact that we had an entertainment system made the time pass so fast that I almost didn't know when we arrived. The airline crew was very polite and helpful. My husband could have used a little more leg room but that was to be expected now..."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great assistance with adjusting plans due to weather,"This winter break trip was a first for our family, and we were aware that trying to leave northeastern Minnesota in December could pose weather challenges. Sure enough, a blizzard warning put the trip in doubt. With a whole lot of help from Delta customer service reps, we were able to leave a day early to avoid the storm and find options on very full flights. We had to get assistance from Delta staff in four different airports and online, and every one was exceptionally helpful and pleasant."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Positive Experience,"Timeliness of departure and arrival of the aircraft, quality of the aircraft, friendly on board customer service, timeliness of luggage arrival, varied in flight entertainment on the front screen are the reasons for my rating. Certainly would recommend this particular leg of air journey to any traveler."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Delta One transatlantic - great flight,"Upgraded to Delta One on a 9 hour westbound transatlantic flight.  A330 in Delta One was an old plane and did not have the private suites that Delta's new A350's have.  Nevertheless, the lie-flat seat in business class was spacious and comfortable, and offered a good measure of privacy when the seat was reclined since your fellow passengers disappear from your direct view.  Delta provides a Tumi-branded amenity kit; although skimpy on the actual amenities (lotion, socks, pen, eyeshade, toothbrush), the bag was really nice and a keeper.  There's also a set of noise-cancelling headphones, which provided good sound (deep, authoritative bass and reasonable clarity) and moderate noise cancellation.  They are nowhere near the quality of Bose Quietcomforts but OK nonetheless.  Note that they use a two prong plug so you will need an adapter if you want to use your own headphones.Food service started with warm nuts and a glass of wine, followed by a big and appealing appetizer plate consisting of salad, soup, a small piece of beef, and warm bread.  It was generous and excellent, and could almost pass for a meal in itself.  The main course followed; I chose the salmon which was unfortunately overcooked.  It was followed by an ice cream sundae with two huge scoops and your choice of toppings.  I slept through the mid-flight cookie service but pre-landing was served an absolutely delicious pastrami sandwich with cheese, grilled onions and mayo.  One of the best sandwiches I've had in a long time.  In all, service in Delta One on this flight was attentive but not intrusive, with friendly and professional flight attendants.  The ability to lie flat on a long flight is worth the upgrade, and the supersoft pillow and comforter that Delta provides makes sleeping easy."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Great Service on Christmas,"We traveled at 6 am on Christmas morning and returned on New Year's Eve.  This is a time that most would rather be celebrating the holidays and not working.  All 4 flights, the crew were fantastic.  Pleasant and ready to serve.  The cockpit crew were also very friendly in greeting and thanking passengers on departure. Every flight arrived early!!!We will continue to make every attempt in the future to use Delta because of their Team!"
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Delta Air Lines...good price...uneventful trip...went as planned.,"Delta...I book way ahead so I got very good price.  I just want to get in, get on, and go.  Most of the time Delta gets it going.  Comfortable seats, movie...land...that's it for me.  I like Delta."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Widebody airplane best way to go for all night flights.,"Even though our flight was 8 hours, it was about as pleasant as can be expected (unless you are traveling first class).  Individual screens with plenty of choices for music, movies and TV shows.  Lots of beverages, two meals and snacks were provided.  Pillows and blankets also provided.  Flight was on time."
n/a,40,A great crew,My compliments to the team at the delta sky lounge in terminal 3 and also the gate. Informative and interactive the process was easy and without stress. The improvements over the past couple of years is evident.
n/a,50,TCB,Normally when there is a flight delay...you end up arriving at your destination later than planned. In this case they were so proactive we arrived 5.5 hours early. The changes and seat were done fast and the luggage transferred with us. Great experience and excellent experience.
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Good seats with great TV,Travelled recently from San Francisco to Albany The boarding was seamless. Everybody had huge carryons sometimes 2 which they seemed to allow though naturally if you were in the last group they began to ask you to check them which would be a pain.The seats were very comfortable The entertainment was great: it’s amazing to have free movies and tv on a domestic flight. Was able to watch the football playoffs the entire flight which made the time pass very quickly.I flew Southwest  from Albany to San Francisco and the flight seemed to go on forever (though they with their free bags great seats and great seeing are still number 1 in my book)
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Great straight Forward trip,"Delta is a good, if not great, US airline. There is nothing they do badly. Service in first class is excellent and they genuinely try to do a good job...and succeed most of the time."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,"Delta from Eugene to Jackson, WY","Had a great experience from the start of our first flight until destination. I also booked first class since we were on an outdoor adventure and needing four bags for clothing, the extra charge for first class was more economical than booking a lower class seat and paying for the baggage.Service on board was great as well as the seats and on-time performance."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Vacation.,We fly Delta whenever possible because of their quality of service and no hidden fees.  They have always been accommodating.  You get what you pay for.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Don’t forget corded headphones with a jack,The flight was easy to board and not bad at 5 hours. I had to sit in the middle bc my husband likes the aisle and it was okay. I forgot you need headphones with a jack to watch the screens but I had a book to read. Or I napped.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Nonstop flight to Punta Cana DR,"Excellent flight & crew. Clean, newer airplane. Good choice for entertainment on board 5 hour flight."
n/a,40,Birthday Trip Worth Every Penny,"Of course once in a lifetime opportunity so why not take it, enjoy and lived it! My Birthday trip was extra especial since we had the best seats on the house all the way to Honolulu. I couldn't be more happier. The service was very good, attentive and everyone are friendly. Thank you Delta for a great experience every time I fly with you. The flight was great and not a delayed, regardless of the tragedy that just happened from the Volcano in the Philippines. Prayers to the people affected by the Volcano eruption."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Not what I had read about,"Really wasn’t impressed at all , we left New York at 950 in the morning our flight was over 10 hours long and the food service was dire , we got a turkey sandwich and another sandwich just before landed don’t even know what it was as didn’t eat it ,didn’t even get a choice , luckily I was a vegetarian,not was I had read about in reviews of delta , on our shorter flight to New York on a different airline but under the same firm , we were literally waited on hand and foot with a cooked meal and ample drinks 10 times better than delta , I was told to shut my window blind which annoyed me as I wasn’t sleeping ( it was daytime ) and I suffer travel sickness so looking at a straight horizon help , would I personally recommend delta , nope ."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Bad trip never recommend,"We flew from Madison to Boston with a connection flight in Detroit. The first flight was delayed 45 minutes and the second left without us, as well as 12 other customers. The customer service at airport did reschedule another trip that is 8 hours after our original flight. The alternative one got delayed too. We tried to go back home and the customer service at airport couldn't help. We tried calling the one on phone which been so mean to us. I never recommend this airlines to any one, especially if you have kids."
n/a,20,Delta's economy vs basic economy is bull crap,"I fly delta frequently as slc is a delta hub.  However, when delta decided to switch to basic economy for cheapest fares i am considering not using them anymore.  My beef with them is that they try to tell you that if you book main cabin which is often $60 or more per ticket that you can select your seats.  That is what I call a load of crap.  You can look at the seats available and its all middle seats or seats at the back of the plane.  You can pay an additional $30 to $60 more for a better seat.  So I say do not book main cabin just for priviledge of selecting middle or back row seats.  Shame on delta for running such a scam."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Wonderful,"The flight was great to Atlanta from Detroit. My son had a nose bleed from Atlanta to Montgomery flight, the stewardess wasn't experienced but the other guest were very helpful."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Horrible Baggage experience with Delta Airlines,"I flew out with Delta Airlines who lost my luggage for 48 hours. I spent an absurd amount of out of pocket expenses to and from the airport to retrieve my lost baggage. I then filed numerous claims without one response to received ANY type of compensation for this awful experience. Once I finally decided to call Delta Airlines, they told me my claim was CLOSED by Vicki Hayes without any notation on their end and still no response to me, as a customer. I will never be flying with this company ever again and do not recommend."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Nice Flight,This was my first ever international flight. It went very well aside from me just being a complete nervous wreck. Flights were on time and there were no issues at all. Flight attendants were a delight. When we got on our flight from ATL to Cancun they gave us all the needed paperwork to get through customs a little bit faster. This was so helpful.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Landed on time. despite avoiding storm,"Return flight from SFO to ATL on 1/11 was as a storm was sweeping across the southern US, from west to east. The pilots did a great job avoiding chop and diverted via Knoxville, TN to avoid the worst of the storm which hit the ATL area about 90 minutes after we had landed. Great job by the pilots to achieve an on-time arrival!"
Date of travel: January 2020,20,Dreadful ,"I’m flying Delta Comfort Plus having booked Virgin Atlantic Premium Economy LAX to LHR via New York. I genuinely cannot believe how dreadful it is. I’m currently sat on a blanket I’ve brought (no blanket provided) as the seats are so incredibly uncomfortable. We’ve not even taken off and my bum is numb and my back hurts. It’s impossible to get comfortable. I flew Premium Economy on Virgin the States, which was a dream.Do not waste your money on this awful service! Best take the bus - it’s more comfortable!"
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Great service,"We travelled home from St Thomas in January. Delta was on time, all personnel were polite and professional. We had a wonderful flight even in economy. I will fly Delta again."
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Delays are so irritating!,"I don't normally fly Delta as in the past and in the back of my mind, I wasn't happy and honestly can't remember why.  But a great price came up to fly from St. Louis to Belize.  The first half of the flight was fine.  The second leg out from Atlanta was delayed and the resulting delays kept on being pushed back to a later and later time.  The inconvenience was just irritating as we had connecting flights to make in Belize (which we didn't make). I'm sure this happens on other airlines, but I normally fly Southwest and Alaska without any of these delays or hitches."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Great service and arrived early,"We left Atlanta close to an hour late due to maintenance to repair a seat.  However, we arrived in London about 40 minutes early.The service on the flight was great! We were given warm washcloths before meals, travel kits that contained an eye mask and headphones, a blanket and pillow, and even were asked if we needed an additional blanket.  Snacks were available throughout the flight and drinks were served several times. The dinner meal was good and served very warm.Delta just became our favorite of the major airlines!"
Date of travel: January 2020,20,Poor service,"My step son and friend were flying to Costa Rica via ATL when bad weather delayed them for 24 hrs. Delta told them that they could sleep in the airport or find a hotel on their own. Delta did not even offer a free drink! I realize weather is not the airlines fault, but poor customer service is. I thought Delta was better then that!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Jeff Covington was his name,"The KINDEST most professional person I have EVER had the pleasure of being assisted by. We had an unscheduled stop over at Salt Lake City due to a medical emergency. We subsequently missed our connecting flight to Santa Fe. There was NO hotel in SLC. My son & I were FREEZING & had just left the hospital. There were NO seats on the last flight. I was ill & had been to hospital & a doctor had to certify that I could travel. Mr Covington found 1 seat but that would mean separating my son & I. He then did the most amazing thing any human being has ever done for me. He made an announcement to ask someone who had somewhere to stay locally & could travel the next morning to give up their seat for $800. I feel like crying as I write this / in fact I am crying. The medical emergency was me- my life had got too much & I couldn’t take anymore so I took an overdose of tablets on the plane with an intention to kill myself. So you can imagine what his kindness meant to me. It made me realise that there is love & kindness in this world. It was like God saying to me through Mr Covington, ‘I care, you are valuable’ thank you to Delta. I have since returned to the UK & received treatment & I am well now. I am travelling again using Delta. Thank you"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Great service!!,"I hadn’t flown Delta in quite a while, but I regret no doing it every time. They are the best at customer service. The flight attendants were so friendly and attentive to every need. The seats are comfortable and my son loved the tv’s on the back of the seats. He wants to fly Delta every time now!! Great experience!"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Excellent Flight crew and Pilot,"January 3rd, 2020 we were in a terrible thunderstorm and told to power down our electronics and we would be landing shortly. The fasten seat belt sign was on. The pilot and fight crew were fabulous. The pilot was calm, cool, and collected and made me feel safe and cared for with his confident speech. Flight crew was collecting cups and smiling, very relaxed and professional. We landed on the second attempt while the lightening was flashing wildly! The entire plane clapped and cheered for him! This is a perfect example of how a  exceptional airline is run. I'm flying Delta in June and July. They also took care of my luggage which was damaged. This is a top notch company! Fly Delta!!!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great customer service!,"An overbooked flight by Delta on Christmas Eve! Needed one seat, however we were traveling as a pair. The agent was able to give us BOTH a travel voucher to take a somewhat later (6 hours) flight to the same destination. She was an EXCELLENT counter agent and was very professional in every aspect! We were very impressed. A much better seat assignment was also received for our delay. Thank you Delta."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Upgraded to comfort plus,"Flight was fine, glad we upgraded to comfort plus this gave us better space. Was able to watch a movie to help the time pass"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Smooth flight and connection at LAX. Wish Delta was a hub in Denver.,"We flew Delta from Denver, through LAX, to Maui and back again.  All staff were helpful and supportive throughout the journey, including everyone from the bag checkers (especially the ones in Maui) through to the flight attendants who were patient with my children that were trying to order their own in-flight snacks.  The planes were clean and comfortable, and the seat-back entertainment units had enough options to entertain my whole family, who never ended up using their carried-on tablets.  The flight experience was pleasurable enough that it made me wish that Delta had Denver as a hub versus the 8-9 direct destinations that they provide today. :("
Date of travel: December 2019,50,On time,"Dec.3/19 On time leaving DTW and landed a few minutes early In Cancun.  Snack service was friendly and if you wanted extra cookies it was no problem .Movie selection was good.  The flight deck gave informative updates on location, time, and Altitude. All and all Very goodAlso a half hour early returning to DTW Dec. 17/19"
Date of travel: January 2020,40,To Florida and back,"Over all I have been pleased by Delta.  We spend the extra $$ for Delta comfort for more leg room but some seats in the front have smaller seats and armrests that do not move.  A little uncomfortable.  But the flight attendants are nice, happy and friendly.  They also don't prevent you from using the restroom if you just can't wait any longer.  Snacks offered are pretty good and the entertainment helps lots to distract from the possible long flight.  Most flights are full so your carry-on can be checked free if you volunteer.  Also the boarding is very organized so goes quickly.  We will certainly use them again"
Date of travel: November 2019,20,A dleayed international flight,"The International flight left Amsterdam 1 hr late.  this would immediately cause us to miss our connecting flight in Detroit.   In Detroit the Jetway driver crashed into the plane, at the the gate and we sat on the plane for 2 hours waiting to disembark.  in addition our luggage was not delivered to the baggage claim for an hour after we passed through customs and passport control. Of course we missed our connection and had to wait in the airport until the next day.  what should have been a 24 hour trip took 42 hours."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Airplane travel is not much fun these days,"I am 6'3, tall but not abnormally.  My knees press into the back of the seat in front of me or into the cracks between them.  The seats are too close together to allow them to recline as in days of yore, ya get just a couple of inches now.  The windows have no relation to the location of the seats, as the seats are no longer positioned per original design.  The FAA, toothless dogs that they are have no idea if you can get out in the time they stipulate but have not bothered to run an egress test since the cramming in began.  Plus, the fat people.  I am hoping to plan my life to not get on one of the poorly maintained tin cans again...but you know how that goes.  And of course, there is the TSA, dedicated to 'making you safe'.  As if.  -Veteran '66-68"
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Ok flight,"Good flight and service, the crew pass few times the water. Seat comfortable but not entertainment during 6 hours of flying."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Awesome overall experience!,Very comfortable flight! Space in the seating area was really comfortable especially for economy seating. Professional and friendly airline staff from boarding to flight attendants. Love Delta airlines.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Fabulous customer service,"My luggage was damaged during this flight and Delta paid the entire cost of replacing the luggage. I was thrilled that they took responsibility and owned up to their mistake without a fuss. They were considerate, kind, and respectful. I will fly Delta every chance I get to travel. The plane was clean and we landed safely during a terrible thunderstorm. Skilled pilots and professional employees."
n/a,50,American Express /Delta card,"The Delta /,American Express card really doesn't get you many perks beside free checked luggage. The early boarding has been reduced to half the planes on before you. Then with seats open they punish you by making couples sit apart because you don't pay upgrade fees.  Come on guys a better perk would be to let you at least sit together with your credit card. The flight was ok"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Great service & free meals!,"My loyalty to Delta increases each time I fly with them. They have great customer service, reasonable pricing for in-flight Wi-Fi and a great selection of in-flight entertainment! They're also one of the few (if not only?) airlines that still offers a free meal for domestic flights!  Not to mention, the credit card perks are totally worth it!"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Fairly smooth flying pretty much from beginning to end,"I made my booking online because I saw there were some deals. The transaction was smooth and the website was easy to use. I checked in online in the usual time before departure. I had purchased economy lite tickets, so I did not have a checked bag included (I like to fly more simply these days). It was smooth as usual getting through security at McCarran. The gate agents seemed pleasant, and I did not have a need to speak with them for any reason other than to provide them my boarding pass, etc. The plane was clean and the seats were pretty usual for planes these days. I never find the seats comfortable on planes and always have to use a cushion to sit on and generally a neck pillow for head support. The seats pitch and all the seat amenities e.g. sound, USB, etc. were functional. It seemed like a newer plane; however, I'm never really good at telling because many times the airlines do the retro fit thing to make it a bit more modern/clean. This particular flight arrived a little late but there was enough time to connect and make our next segment from AMS to MAD. Although I was mainly speaking about this specific flight from LAS to AMS, all the flights were decent. The flight attendants and gate agents seemed friendly and helpful. Some of the flights were operated by KLM airlines and I truly enjoyed their flight attendants who really seemed friendly (maybe it's the Dutch Touch - LOL) and willing to go the extra mile for passengers from my observation. I'm not a needy passenger, so I rarely interact with flight attendants on most flights unless they're offering food, drink, etc. Overall I have no real complaints but I wish economy food was a bit better but that goes for all airlines. Unless you're going to pay a high price for food or the flights, I don't think this will change much until the world comes together and complains."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Amazing experience on International flights,"I was pleasantly surprised by how great the service and overall experience was on my international Delta flights. Their app was super easy to use and kept me notified on any updated info. Even though I was sitting in the very back of the plane for both flights, it didn't feel like I was. Every seat had a screen in front of it with a ton of movies to choose from. The food selection and options were fantastic and I was honestly blown away by the extensive menu and quality of the food. I was able to bring my carry on bag with me on the flight, with no bag fees, which was a huge plus. Next time I fly international I will definitely choose Delta!"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Surprisingly good service,"Delta has partnered with Air France and KLM and so parts of my trip were on a plane that said one of the other airlines. But Delta is the mother company. The partnership was demonstrated to be a good one!  The flight attendants were busy the entire trip offering warm towels, beverages, snacks and meals and all were surprisingly good. They even gave out menus so you could choose what you wanted to eat!  (The caesar salad was bad/rusty lettuce, soggy croutons/ so skip that if you have a choice) . The seating is still small and uncomfortable by the end of a 10 hour trip, but that won't change. I'm 63 inches tall and my husband is also short, so leg room is okay as long as the carry on didn't take up all the room. We weren't able to choose our seats because we chose super economy, and the man next to me was over 6 feet tall and close to 300 lbs. He hung over my arm rest and into the aisle. Next time, I'll try to come up with the extra money and choose a better seat. The bathroom line was longer as the flight time went on, and the bathroom was messy.  Too bad it isn't in anyone's job description to pay attention to the cleanliness of the bathroom. The individual tv monitor lets you entertain yourself with movies, music, tv shows, etc, and the time passed."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,"Come on Delta, Do your part when We Arrive-as Promised!","The Flight was great. There was a little storm but the piolot did a fantastic job getting us through it! I arrived in Atlanta with two small children. I had asked for some help since they both were under 5 and it was late at night. Unfortunately, the help never arrived. A kind gentleman on a small cart escourted us to the correct area but we still wound up walking over a mile to get to the baggage area. That's pretty hard when it's late and your little legs are already tired. Two elderly couples with health issues were also promised help upon arrival from that same flight. Neither of those couples were given the help they were promised either."
Date of travel: January 2020,20,Delta gate issues,Arrived early and Delta cannot find a gate.  Am I the only one who seems to experience Delta’s troubles when arriving early?
Date of travel: January 2020,20,One of the worst for service in USA,"Attendants at the LAX airport are lazy. Plane was ready for boarding early, but no one wanted to do anything. Looked like they were busy playing on their phones and others enjoying snacks. This led to a 50 minute delay from the time they were supposed to board. Then this caused us to miss connecting flight gate closure by 2 minutes. Connecting plane in Atalanta still had gate attached and door open but they would not let us on. Seems they sold our tickets already. No other available flights for days and they were not accommodating, only glib and nasty. Flight attendants were unfriendly. Then attendant at gate in Daytona leg looked at moving our seats only to cancel all the ones we had reserved, then had terrible time trying to get us any seats. Delta is terrible, has been for decades. Every trip with them always had problems. Avoid them if possible. Management down is awful."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Europe travel,"This was my second time crossing the Atlantic with Delta Air Lines. I must say, I was impressed both times. The flight was 9 hours but video entertainment was available so no one was bored, I know I wasn't. Food was decent, good flavor with fine desserts. Snacks and drinks were available throughout the flight. Seats were ok, we had a pillow and a blanket with those things to cover your eyes with and we were given ear buds. The flight itself was smooth. No turbulence. No delays."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Exceeded Expectations,"Great experience from check in, inflight service, crew efficiency, baggage handling, and onetime departure and arrival. Outstanding commitment to customer service and satisfaction."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,appreciating the sky's of delta,Great service by crew and entertainment screens on back of seats to help keep kids busy. The attendants came to my daughter's assistance when our granddaughter developed a fever and did everything possible to help lower her fever and comfort her parents. Thanks Delta!
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Horrible service from Delta at Atlanta International Airport,"The baggage check-in staff at Delta are among the worst customer service employees anywhere.  Delta closed the regular baggage drop-off lines and it was unclear where economy travelers should go.  The priority section was open and one other area was open.  I went to the latter. The 2 employees there were in no hurry and one loudly complained about people coming the their line for baggage drop-off.  I asked for clarification on whether I could drop off baggage there and was told yes.  But when it was finally our turn (waiting 12 minutes at the front of the line), the Delta employee closed her line and said she was going for a bathroom break.  We waited another 10 minutes and finally went to the Sky Priority line. This type of behavior from the Atlanta Delta check-in staff is the norm in my many encounters with them.  As for the plane, at a mere 6 feet tall my knees touched the chair in front of mine and the recline button (worth about 2 inches) on my chair did not work (this was a 9 hour flight).Whenever I can avoid Delta in the future, I will do so."
n/a,40,On My Way to Dubai ,I am a pretty tall woman with hips and I was very comfortable in my seats. I initially had economy seats and had no leg room. If you have any height on you I would advise you to upgrade to the next level. You will enjoy your flight even more and be rested.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Awesome flight free movies and more,"Can’t say this too often about air travel but our direct flight from Orlando to Cincinnati was a breeze. Good service, nice entertainment, free headphones too. What a pleasure."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Flying Delta,Planes clean in great repair comfortable the inflight movies made the trip go fast. There was more leg room then I expected I’m 6 ft 3 so the leg room is important
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Excellent in flight service.,"Delta airline is one of the best airline cross the pacific, although fly economy class, they serve welcome drink, eye mask, toothbrush, ear plug and slipper for free. The meal service is also upgraded recently. Beside all of this, air fare is one of cheapest among other carrier. Mileage system also great, no mile expire for every one, not necessary that you are with elite member."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,"Comfortable flight, good leg room space","I was expecting the worst experience on this trip since SFO had significant delays during the time I decided to travel (SFO had one runway closed due to repairs). Coming to the Airport, we were warned that flights to SFO had an average of 4-hr delay. When I got to the airport, the ground staff of Delta made sure to update us on our new schedules. They even gave us snacks as we waited for our plane to arrive. When the plane finally arrived, we were surprised that they were using a bigger than usual plane to accomodate more passengers because of the delay. This meant that we had more leg-room and space."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Delta means Dependable,Delta is very professional and friendly.  Our flight was a little bit early arriving which is always nice.  The flight attendants were helpful.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Easy Peasy,Needed a wheel chair and they were right there at both ends of the flight.  The flight itself was excellent and the flight attendants were very accommodating.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Always consistent,"Generally Delta is very consistent on time and efficient.  This flight was over booked and late getting to Board.  The Gates at Minneapolis are cramped and no one was very happy.   So I thought Sky priority was nice getting on pretty early but as I get up to the plane step on, the Flight attendant holds me up to wait, Okay well she took drink orders for the entire first class area and then asked her assistant to give them all waters as well as we waited several minuets with 100 people backing up behind me moaning, Really poor timing and rude as well.  First time I have seen that happen.  My feet did not need extra time on them."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Winter Adventure to Milan,The flight from the US to Milan was overnight. ..that is definitely the way to go! Delta crew was very helpful and attentive.
Date of travel: January 2020,40,"New Plane, Plenty of Room in Comfort Seat","Great experience on both departing and returning flight. Brand new plane. Very clean. I paid the extra money for a comfort seat and it was well worth it. More leg room, larger seat and closer to the front of the airplane. The only thing I didn't like was the cost of the in-flight internet. $16.99, what a rip off. But overall a great flying experience. On time, great service and hassel-free."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Christmas Holiday flight to the Netherlands,"We had two flights before we reached Amsterdam , first was Delta second KLM. KLM from Boston to the Netherlands was okay. Our flight attendants were great on both. i just had a small issue with them changing our seats from what I had book originally booked.it wasn't the best but it wasn't the worst either...delta plane was very old"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,TAMPA TO LGA December 22,"Another wonderful flight experience. Starting at the Sky Club and then on the plane. I have flown 3 times the past 3 months and all flights at Tampa, JFK and LaGuardia were on time. That's is just amazing. Excellent service on the flight with a decent lunch of BBQ chicken sliders."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Excellent Flight Crew,"Every airline has its critics and its contented customers. I have never had a significantly bad experience with Delta and, for this specific flight, and for Delta's customer service, I was really, really impressed. The flight attendants were headed by Perry, and she, and her fellow attendants smoothly handled a very full flight and, additionally, were quite helpful towards my husband and me (I, having recently been dealing with a double fractured couple of bones and needing to use a cane for now). The crew was beyond friendly, accommodating and, to top it off, the captain came out of the cockpit and made the pre-flight announcements himself interjecting a lot of humor, gave out those cute plastic pilot's wings to to the toddler travelers, and did a yeoman's job piloting through some bumpy clouds. Lastly, Delta's customer service had wheelchairs waiting for me (embarrassing as they are for this normally very capable traveler) at each destination AND bumped the two of us to Comfort+ seats so that I would be more comfortable traveling with those two NOT-so-comfortable fractured bones. Now, THAT was impressive"
Date of travel: December 2019,20,Nightmare,"Flew from Halifax to Toronto on Westjet, Toronto to Atlanta on Delta, the plane was late getting in thus we missed our Delta connection to Myrtle Beach that night. Reps told us there was nothing they can do as we originally booked through West Jet, so we called West Jet and were told that Delta must rebook for us. This went on for about 3 hours with the two airlines passing the buck until around 2am we finally lost it with anger. Delta reluctantly booked us on another flight the next day. We were told that Delta and WestJet will use each other when flights are over booked...WESTJET and DELTA you need to COMMUNICATE with each other on this. Oh, and the couple that were travelling with us got bumped because they booked their flights using RBC Points and were told that customers paying cash would have preference if the flight was over booked, which is wrong because those that use their points certainly have paid for them 10x fold ....very disappointed in Delta and Westjet for not stepping up when they should have..."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Possibly best flight ever,I had the option of United or Delta but I've seen the united breaks guitars video on youtube so I chose Delta. I am so glad I did because that flight was absolutely wonderful and the flight attendants were lovely.
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Worse flight ever ,"This Delta flight was like being on a bus . It was a 20 yr old plane and rattled as such . The seats were uncomfortable, no foot rest which meant my legs dangled and I had blood struggling to flow. This is dangerous, it was freezing cold with no offers of blankets , food was scarce as was liquid refreshment. We had just transferred from Virgin Atlantic where the difference was stark ! The staff on Delta were disinterested and hardly seen on our evening flight . They need some education from Virgin staff !! Unfortunately this experience tainted the start of my vacation. I will not ever fly with Delta again. They need to understand they are not only providing a service for ( what must be ) very patient and relaxed internal American passengers !! O out of 100 !!!"
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Flight Attendants Were Outstanding ,Recently returned internationally on Delta.  The flight attendants on this flight were all outstanding.  I must admit the meal service in economy wasn’t too bad; better than I expected.  Maybe because the meals were contracted with an international vendor.  Overall comfort was average.
Date of travel: January 2020,30,N no or as good as Polaris on United,"The lounge is terrible at Haneda (old food) staff just stand around but it does have a nice view.  The seats on the flight which are behind each other if you want a window flight are ok, felt cramped compared to Polaris on United and not very comfortable.  Food was just ok - nothing to write home about.  Staff were ok but didn’t see them that much.  Pilots take over the front two toilets before landing so everyone is in a long line trying to use the bathroom one last time - don’t recommend using sky one on delta when there are much better options.  Polaris lounge is really good in LA international terminal."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Flight attendant made me check my bag even though there was plants of room,I was one of the last people to board and the fight attendant told me she didn’t think there would be room for my bag so I had to check it. 2 bins right next to my seat we’re completely empty. I quickly asked if I could get my bag back and she said no we don’t have time. Super annoyed because I’ve been gone on a work trip for days and anxious to get home and see the kids. F-
Date of travel: December 2019,50,First class rows getting closer together,"We love Delta's First Class service, from check-in, to offer of pre-flight drinks, to special tags on our bags.  However-I am noticing the seats getting closer together-the gentleman in front of me reclined his seat-too close for comfort.  Thank you Delta for keeping the screens in the seatbacks so we don't need to fire up our own device to watch a movie."
Date of travel: December 2019,20,Will choose a different airline next time,"I chose to fly Delta because the schedule met my needs and the price was good.  Or so I thought.  While the basic cost of the flight was lower than what I had found with other airlines, I failed to recognize the additional cost of checking a bag (no free baggage check for even one bag) and change fees.  We decided to make a change in our plans 90 days before we left and the cost of changing the flight nearly doubled the cost of the original ticket.In addition I did not see the benefit of upgrading the seat if I only got two more inches in leg room but found out that the two inches made all the difference in the world.  The overall cost was not lower than another airline and the discomfort experienced by not upgrading was something I will not endure again.  When scheduling a flight make sure you are comparing similar seating and other benefits before making a reservation."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,"Good flights, but why is domestic First Class so basic?","On the positive side: the crew was very nice on all flights and we were on schedule and well informed of progress throughout the trip. On the potential improvement side, the First Class seats don't recline much, the flight attendant asked us about a meal choice of one - there were no food options left, the movie offerings are just OK. For the price difference, it seems like the offering should be more differentiated. If you take a 2-3 hour longer flight over the ocean in Business class you get much better offerings than the so called First pof domestic flights."
Date of travel: December 2019,30,small seats and getting smaller?,"I'm rather large and my wife average size.  We always try and get Exit Rows.  It was not available on this early morning flight. At least they sat us together, but the LAST row on the plane and I couldn't;t get both legs in the seat. One was in the aisle most of the flight which meant I got hit MANY times by people, rolling carts, etc. A very painful flight for 2+ hours. Why are theses getting smaller every time I fly???  BTW, one Exit row was still open after I was told the flight was ""FULL""?"
Date of travel: December 2019,10,The worst experience in my life,"I purchased a ticket with Air France but was operated by Delta on December 19th. Unfortunately I had the worst experience ever. I had to travel to Europe for a family emergency on Dec 19th. I booked the flight and on the check in they told me my passport was expiring in less than 6 months. Unfortunately I didn't even had time to check my passport because of this sudden emergency. I just bought a ticket the same day, packed and left the next morning.As mentioned earlier I wasn't allowed to fly to Albania (Eur). I begged them to double check if theres any discrepancies but they were firm and didn't even try to do anything despite my situation. I had my passport expedited and call CS to check if they could move my flight to next day. They refused to adjust the ticket and were completely helpless. They were trying to sell me a $4800 ticket from air France , meanwhile I told them that I could see a $2000 on Air France website but they were refusing to help. I was just desperate, hang up and bought the cheaper online ticket from Air France. The next day a friend told me to check the travelling state department rules. Albania and many other European countries had a clause of 3 months passport expiration and not 6 months as stated by Delta at the airport. I had to call them back to confirm. They accepted immediately it was their fault but still were refusing to refund my first ticket money. They said quote ( Yes it is our fault this happened but this is a non refundable ticket). I let them know I am hiring a lawyer for this. The moment lawyer was mentioned they reversed everything and refunded me the ticket. After all this unnecessary stress on top of what I had already Id say I am very disappointed with this company. The flight in the other hand was very good and I enjoyed their features, meals etc."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Price was right,"I flew on Christmas Day and I could be on time for the Christmas dinner, thanks for on schedule flight. Foods were reasonable. And for me welcome drink was new on economy class of Delta.  And though it was on holiday, price was very much attractive. I booked on Delta’s web site."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,GREAT FLIGHT,"Being a native of Atlanta, I have always enjoyed flying Delta. Also, my wife and I requested the seats next to the emergency exits and they complied. We did on the trip going and coming back. The flight left on time going and arrived early coming back.The staff was super duper."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Comfortable flight to Hawaii,"Delta was a great airline for our long flights to and from Hawaii.  They offered the best price with a short layover in LA where we could stretch our legs and get a meal.  The staff gave quick, friendly service at the terminal counter.  The boarding process was well organized and I could actually understand their announcements which is seldom the case for other airlines I have flown.  The plane was clean with comfortable seating which was roomy enough, but could have been a bit better.  Service during the flight was also friendly.  The seat back entertainment center was a plus for our long flight, which included games and several newer movies we had not seen.  I would use them again."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Best US airline!,"While no US based carrier can compete with the top notch, first class experiences of Asian airlines we love Delta. We have been flying Delta internationally the past couple of years and have been pleasantly surprised, both in first class and economy. In years past we have flown many international airlines- Air New Zealand, Air Tahiti Nui, Emirates, Singapore, Cathay Pacific, ANA, Korean,  Thai, Air Asia, KLM, Lufthansa, Swiss Air, British, Alitalia, Latam, South African, Qantas, Jet Star and some others, I’m sure I’m forgetting. US carriers can get a bad rap for service and experience in comparison to foreign carriers. But I have been pleasantly surprised by all the trips we’ve taken on Delta. The service, cleanliness, entertainment options, on time arrival and food have all been great. I can think of plenty of rough trips on other airlines (Air Malawi- never again!) (Jet Star International was so disappointing even in a brand new 787) (Air Asia, paying for seats, water, etc, just obnoxious..) (United- traumatic for my daughter) and I’m happy to say we finally have a company that supports our own nation’s economy that provides a great experience in the air. Grateful."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,"ON TIME, CLEAN AIRCRAFT, GREAT SERVICE","delta was aware that a lot of people had the same connecting flight to CVG with a short turn around, they got us to ATL   ahead of time , off loaded the plane ASAP, we all made the CVG flight and with our luggage. YEAH !!!!!!"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,First Class Excellence,"Our flight home was fabulous.  Our flight attendant was friendly and accommodating.  Our pilot even stopped to joke with us after the flight.  Excellent flight, I will fly Delta again for sure!"
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Too long a flight for the distance,We had to fly from Tucson to Salt Lake City to Los Cabos. Way out of the way. Connections from Tucson are terrible.
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Flying Delta,"This was our 4th time flying with Delta. We have had no issues with Delta. We will continue to fly with Delta. Love that the Pilot kept us updated on weather and our arrival time to our destination. Only reason for the 4 star is when the crew is out on the floor with the carts serving drinks and snacks you can not get up to go to the bathroom, and this flight that was a problem! Had to go, and couldn't get out of our seat to go! Downfall on that! If you go to go-you got to go!!! Flight itself in the air was fine."
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Was not impressed.,The airplane was very old and dated. I've never flown on Delta and not had a tv screen to watch a movie on. My seat was broken too!
Date of travel: January 2020,40,"Liked the airline, hated the red eye flight","We were happy with Delta. Our return flight home had much more seat space than our flight out. Love that you get to watch free movies, sports, etc. Really the only bad experience was the red eye. We really didn’t get any sleep because there just wasn’t room to stretch out with a full flight.  Our personal preference in the future is to fly sometime during the day. We won’t fly a red eye again. Takes too long to recover the next day. I would recommend Delta, we’ve flown them a few times and always been pleased."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Shockingly great flight and service onDelta economy class,"I was initially not thrilled when I saw I will be flying an old B-767 on this root and not being able to secure an upgrade to business class to boot.The very sweet agent at the gate said to me don't  be afraid the aircraft has a brand new interior.I boarded the aircraft and I was amazed how wonderful indeed it looked with the new leather seats spanking clean.The inflight service was sooo wonderful! Amazing kind flight in-flight crew wanting to go the extra mile, a menu printed for your choices of foods a bag with earphones and eye-mask etc. I was in total disbelief how wonderful Delta was and shocked to find out that a much lesser pleasant carrier has won the 2019 Skytrax award of the year..."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,First Time I Have Flown Delta Airlines In Over Ten Years,I have not flown Delta Airlines in over ten years because Southwest Airlines always flew from Atlanta to Detroit with no stops. Since Southwest Airlines cut many of their flights there are only one stop lay overs with them but with Delta Airlines you can fly Atlanta to Detroit with no stops. I chose to do this during the  Christmas holidays. The particular jet that was used was very nice and now Delta has tv monitors on the back of each seat. I chose to sit in economy but paid for the seat I was to sit in. The flight is only about 90 minutes but I felt like a sardine in a can. There was barely any room for my legs and knees not to touch the back of the seat in front of me. And then the flight attendants abruptly announce you are not allowed to put your feet in the aisle for any reason. I had chosen an aisle seat because I thought I would have more room to move my legs and feet. I could hardly stand it by the time we landed in Detroit.. for Delta doing so well financially the seating in the economy section is horrible. On my return flight I upgraded to premium economy to have a much more comfortable seat which did cost me more money for the upgrade. I do not know if I can ever stand to fly in the economy section on Delta Airlines ever again.
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Will never fly Delta again ,"Horrible , should have just rented a car to drive to Baltimore . After a long International flight we had a connection to BWI , flight supposed to leave at  9 kept delaying with NO explanation . Was eventually delayed almost 2 hours"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Deltra Traveler,"Loading passengers should load from back to front to avoid the clutter. I know, the First Class folks demand their alcohol within seconds of sitting."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Leavin——wait where are our passports?,"All I can say is thank you to Anthony at the Indianapolis Delta ticket counter. We live 2 hours away and realized that our passports were not with us. Went to the counter and explained what happened. Looked to see if there were any other flights to Cabo and if we could move to that flight. The only flights leaving were in the mornings. With Anthony’s help, he put us on the next morning’s flight. We are so grateful that Delta and Anthony were able to help. Service from counter, check-in, in flight’s and same with connecting flight was outstanding. Thank you again, otherwise we would have not been able to see things like this!"
Date of travel: January 2020,20,Missing the mark,"My TSA pre-check was not on my boarding pass although I've had Nexus and Global traveler for 6-years. As a result the TSA forced me into another line. This is the 3rd time this has happened to me and Delta does not appear interested in correcting this oversight and error on it's part. In-flight service was also poor. It took me 35 minutes after requesting a pair of earbuds to receive them. I rang the call button repeatedly and left it on for several minutes at a time only to be ignored. When I did get earbuds, the touch screen wasn't responding and had to be re-booted, this took another 10-minutes. Comfort+ was cramped and with the poor service, not worth the cost.  On flights of 1 hr or less, I've found that despite advertising service, they don't even provide drinks. So if your flight is 1 hr or less, don't bother. Even service on a 3 hr flight was thin in Comfort + at best. The seat on this flight was a bulk-head window cramped and narrow. So much for Comfort +."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Amazing crew and flight,"We flew together as a large family for a wedding. One family member who hadn’t flown before had a lot of difficulties getting onto the plane, and to add to the pain she had a baby with her too...We explained it to the crew and they agreed to wait for her.Once she got on, they calmly helped her get seated, took the baby and helped her get strapped in. This is one flight we will never forget and will always be thankful for them!"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Nonstop to California,The flight was great and uneventful. Flight attendants were top notch. It was an early flight and I’m sure that had something to do with it
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Great flight!,We flew from  Boston to Grand Cayman thorough Atlanta. Really like the Airbus planes and the service was fantastic. Our flight attendants were friendly and helpful and we had an enjoyable flight. We only wish we didn’t have to go through Atlanta to get to where we want to  go. Hoping they’ll have a nonstop flight someday to Grand Cayman and to Bonaire from Boston. Would definitely fly them again.
Date of travel: January 2020,40,A great experience 99% of the time,"I can honestly say that I have never had a ""bad"" experience on Delta.   They make every effort to take care of their passengers, whether it is First Class or Basic Economy.   It is one of the reasons I fly Delta, especially for business.   There is always one ""bad apple"" flight attendant on occasional flights, but all in all, it is World Class Service.   I just flew from Tampa through Minneapolis to Tacoma, and then back from Tacoma through Detroit to Tampa.  On two of those connections there were, what appeared to be, ""unhappy Flight Attendants"".   It is tolerable, but never expected.    My upgrades have been great, their service superb, and their patience amazing.   Fly Delta!!!"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Flying as it should be,"We paid a little extra for the economy plus/comfort seats. Very worthwhile. The food was airline food, to be sure, but enjoyable just the same, and lots of it (on a 9 hour flight, I would hope for several meals and snacks). Smooth flying, and on time."
Date of travel: February 2019,40,Flight to Kahului,"Delta flight to Hawaii/Maui was pretty good. The cabin was clean, and the flight was on time. The price was reasonable too. Overall I would recommend this flight."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Business class is great,"Attendants going and coming were extremely friendly.  Business class allows for more foot room, wider seats, and free alcohol drinks."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Unexpected,"Return flight with Delta airline giving me unexpected experience.  Spacious legroom, on time, crews with smiley face, lots of entertainment (movies and live TV)"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Very Comfortable flight n The Best Flight staff n Very Professional,It was a very great flight from Chicago staff was very professional n extremely nice THANKS DELTA AIRLINES
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Ecomony Plus is a plus,"This time we paid the extra $$ to have the economy plus seating and it was worth it. Bigger seats, more leg room, plenty of overhead storage. We did an over and back and were surprised at some differences. Over we were allowed to us the forward toilet but coming back not. We found out that there is no retirement age for flight attendants and one had been at it for over 45 years! Our entire cabin crew both ways were older women and they were  more than pleasant,. Food was fine and unlike economy where you may not end up getting a  choice, we were served early and got our choices. At the end of the return to the US flight, we got some  'left over' booze but she had to serve another person before coming back to give us more. Crazy! Our next trip we will pay the extra again-AS both of us are semi handicapped, we went back to our original reservation and added wheelchair service. We got it on both ends of both trips. All arranged up front and while you tip the person driving your chair, it is well worth it. All of our drivers were super and got us thru customs, car rental, ATM, luggage in no time."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,On time and on our way,"What can I say?.....polite attendants, decent snack, great movies, and our flight was on time...thank you Delta."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,More leg room,"Very pleasant trip; everything on time and without any problems. More comfortable seats with more leg room than other carriers for comparable fare. However, my flight was changed sometime before the last few days before departure, and I was not notified. The company I booked for transportation for when I arrived alerted me and I was able to get rescheduled on a different flight that actually worked out better than my original flight."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,"Bought a bike, going home from Chicago.","Lay over in Atlanta, nearly 2.5 hours but, still a good trip home in comfortable seated flights.LONG walk to connecting flight but, not airline's fault.Smaller commuter jet yet, comfortable seating and reclining, along with adjustable headset, free soft drinks and snacks, which we declined because of out Keto lifestyle.Recommended."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Personal business to buy a motorcycle.,"So, we flew on a VERY cold, snowy and icy condition day, lucky us.Surprisingly, flight wasn't cancelled for red eye flight on O-500 flight, that's 5am to non military.Although Delta classification seem bit overboard with numerous ""classes"" of passengers, even the basic class seemed better than our normal flight we take to Vegas with ""discount"" airline, Frontier.Seats were very comfortable, reclining, adjustable head rest with in layed monitor with games and such.Free soft drunks, snacks and carry on baggage each was a big plus.No flight delay on snowy, icy and windy morning.Recommended."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Prepare to suffer with no explanation,"I have made all my plans for a family trip to Europe several months ago. I bought my tickets from Delta Airlines and also reserved my hotel. As a cautious traveler, I also bought trip insurance provided by Delta through Allianz Global Assistance. As you can accept, I was taking all the precautions for any unplanned in-cases. However I never imagined that Delta could cancel the flight from Chicago to Minneapolis with no explanation (later on as announced maintenance issues). This was the start of domino effect. Connection flight from Minneapolis to Amsterdam missed and so forth. They booked us to another flight with was also delayed and then to another flight next day which was overbooked. After cluster of incompetencies, mishandling and so forth we finally made to Europe by purchasing business class tickets. You can all say that why I am complaining since we all made it safely to Europe but I did not even tell you hours spent on the phone while trying to find a resolution. As one agent explained “if I have the trip insurance I will be covered”. The real story or scam is the deal with Delta and Allianz Global Assistance. First they sell you the plan with outlines but no fine print. After you purchase the plan they send you a link for the fine print which is several pages. When you have a problem like us they have every justification not to give you any refund. Also you have to deal with arrogant customer representatives instructed to be rude. As a sky miles member, I will recommend to search other flight options before buying from Delta. If there is not any, please never pay hundreds of dollars for their trip protection/insurance. It is a scam."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great overall service and experience,"Fly out of White Plains with a short layover in Atlanta, en route to Fort Lauderdale.  While we did fly first class, the service fro all was good as we chatted with others on the flight after we landed."
Date of travel: January 2020,20,"Gate changes, delays, grumpy people.","Choosing reasonable flight times is difficult enough. My wife had to go to work Monday morning so we chose a return flight time 6:15pm from Orlando on Sunday. This means we would arrive about 9 pm in Minneapolis. On Sunday morning we were alerted that the departure time was changed to 9:15 PM.....3 hours late! Later at the airport, they again changed it to 9:40 PM. This meant we would not arrive in Minneapolis until well after midnight. We then had a 2 hour drive home, so getting to bed about 2:30 AM and then getting up at 5:30 AM to go to work. No apology for the delay or an explanation was given. We also could not get a seat assignment until at the gate. We noticed a guy (with a wife and two little kids present) yelling and screaming at the desk agents, waving his arms in their faces for at least 10 minutes. On the plane, my seat TV had picture but no sound. Could not get it to work. Yet he was still allowed to board the plane. Air travel is completely disgusting these days."
Date of travel: January 2020,30,In general and as usual confusion reigns.,"There was noting wrong with departure time and arrival, that all went fine. However, flight numbers changed. My wife and I were assigned our seats (could not pick them in advance) and we were seated 11 rows apart. I went online to change seats so we could sit together and it said all seats were taken. However, when we boarded and found our seats, we each had an empty seat beside us. We both had carry-on luggage, but they told my wife she had to check hers, did not tell me. So no time was saved getting off the plane as she had to to go to baggage claim to get her luggage."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,"Bouncy, bouncy","Three-plus hours of the pilot selecting one turbulent altitude after another, bouncing all the way.  Good check-in, good gate agents, left on time, arrived early, good in-flight service, very good baggage service in Vegas."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,great flight,great trip. The flight was a little late getting off the gate but the time was made up enroute. Pilots and flight attendants kept everyone informed and happy
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Poor communication on delay information,"The flight was delayed 30 min, then 30 min, then another 30 min, and 30 min more. We were wondering if the flight was going to take off at all. We asked the counter, and the lady was impatient to answer my inquiry. I even got a text message on my iphone and told me to consider rebooking with no detail. And the airline offered no compensation at all."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,The Best,Fantastic in flight service. Very friendly and accommodating. On time for all legs of the flight. Delta has really stepped up their game!
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Frequent Flyer Benefits that have meaning.,"Frequent flyer benefits with some airlines seem almost meaningless. The early boarding option alone if very helpful when the flights are full (almost always these days), especially when you get your seat early and watch the circus of people trying to find a space for their carry-ons."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,"Through Expedia they advertised, ""no carryons"" so I paid to check mine. Almost every other passenger had carryons.","For the question below:It was for a funeral, but I could not get an answer to my question,  ""are there still bereavement flights?"""
Date of travel: July 2019,50,What is happening with this direct fligth to Malaga from JFK?,I have heard that this flight has been cancelled. This is extremely sad as it was such as wonderful flight and it was always full. I am not sure I understand why Delta has decided to stop such a wonderful service to their customers. This is going to negatively impact our future traveling to Southern Spain.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,"Friendly crew, gate broken at LGA","Flight boarded on time and plane was clean. Didn’t notice any worn or shabby looking seats. Full flight so they offered free bag check for carry ons. Took advantage of on the return trip, but not on the way there. In-flight entertainment was very good. Lots of choices. Beverage and snack service offered. Payment for any add ons is by credit/debit card only. They would not take cash, even for the earphones. Only issue was when we got to LGA and the mechanical gate would not move in the right direction to dock with the plane. Took ground crew about 15 minutes to reset and allow us to deplane. Return trip was same quality experience with flight/crew. No issues with gate at MCO. Will see if there is a section for reviewing airport facilities themselves, but there were issues with staff/facilities at both locations."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Business trip,"I went to Mexico City for a quick work trip, I was super tired and stressed but all the Delta staff made my business trip feel like a pleasure trip. From checking to landing everything was perfect. The cheeses board is amazing!"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Well Prepared to Handle Holiday Delays,Even with Christmas holiday and expected delays...Delta calmly handles them well....Please DO NOT compare Delta with Spirit Airline!!
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Flight back from our vacation,We had a good flight  The stewardess was very polite!  We did have a huge problem...  We did have five people flying and needed to cancel So we had FOUR people flying! They did NOT refund me my points that I had used for my son and Delta  REBOOKED another  person onto our flight?  so they MADE TWICE as much $$ Would have never canceled my son if I had known that they would literally REBOOK his ticket and give me NO compensation??
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Wheels Up!,"Boarding was smooth, Flight Attendant (Tessa) helped us find our seats, then showed us an un-sold seat so we could utilize the extra room - took the time to speak with us! Pilots knowledgable, left on time, snacks and beverages served, arrived on time, no problems. Everything went just like it should. Good job!"
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Cramp seats and terrible food selections,Despite more than half of passengers are Asians the dish selections don’t include many Asian dishes. Seats are cramped and could potentially be unhealthy in terms of blood clotting. Time will tell. Bad flatus from seat mates I could smell because of all the dairy products from ice cream to butter to cheese. Asians are lactose intolerant. Friendly staff are the saving grace. I wonder how much uneaten food is thrown away.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Fantastic service! Would definitely fly again.,"We travelled with Delta to NYC from London Heathrow on Xmas eve and I was very surprised and impressed on the level of service. Cabin crew were so welcoming and interactive. Nothing was too much of an ask. They offer a welcome cocktail upon takeoff  but as I don't drink alcohol they offered to make me one with sparkling water which I thought was very kind. Requesting a special request meal was no problem for Delta either which I had done beforehand and the food was very tasty and substantial. I especially like the special touch they offer of snacks avaliable in the back after the meal service on long haul flights. You had oreos, biscoff biscuits, kind bars, cheeze itz and more.You also had another warm snack and dessert before landing so we felt very well fed and didn't need dinner by the time we got to the hotel. They even gave a Toblerone mini choc before landing which went down well with our kids.The plane itself was nice too. Good leg room, nice TV screens although both ways there were some connectivity issues but crew were quick to resolve it.Overall i would fly Delta again and thank you to the crew for their lovely service. It never goes unnoticed and was a great start and end to our family holiday."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,No information about changes to the flight for international travel,We booked delta airline flight for international travel two months ahead. But by the time we started our travel which includes last two transit as delta airlines. Delta airlines changed the schedule of the flight which according to customer care is frequent. I ended up 13 hour hour journey from Amsterdam to Minneapolis to Raleigh durham converted to 18 hour journey. And delta didn’t bother to inform me about change is schedule too. So till the last flight I have no idea I will end up staying in Minneapolis airport for additional 4 hour. With kids it’s tough. Won’t recommend delta airlines for international travel especially if the journey is long and with multiple connecting flight and kids.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,FIRST CLASS LOST BAGGAGE SERVICE,"On of our bags did not arrive in Rio. We expected problems as we were traveling into a foreign country, but much to our surprise the response ( in English) from the baggage claim delta rep was perfect. He immediately located our bag in Atlanta through the computer,  and assured us it would be delivered the next day to our hotel in Rio.It was our son's  bag and he needed long pants to wear that evening, and a dressy shirt. The rep told us to buy what we absolutely needed, which we did at the Duty Free Shop upon exiting the airport. He gave us the form to seek reimbursement on line. We got home to the US and filed the form and received a check for reimbursement within a week of filing."
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Limited vegetarian options and very average service,"Had to take a long flight from Vancouver to Mineopolis, 5 hour layover and then to London, same drill on the way back. Seats were very narrow but had good leg room. On the longer flight they offered food and drinks but service was slow and staff were not very friendly. They ran out of vegetarian options by the time they got to us and didn't offer any alternatives or compensation-in fact the steward looked put out that we were disappointed . Probably will avoid flying with Delta in the future."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Worst airline ever,"We will NEVER fly with Delta again. You can’t upgrade after you get to the airport, you can’t choose your seat assignment when you buy your ticket. When we tried to check in at the desk, they told us we’re “at the bottom” and to come back after they checked other passengers in (nobody was in line).  It says you can download the app to check in and get your boarding passes and seat assignments but you can’t. Delta overrides it so you can’t."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Trip Home,"As much as we hated to leave Cancun, the real world was waiting. Delta is always very efficient with boarding and on time departure. This flight was no exception, and arrived in Atlanta a few minutes early."
n/a,50,Delta One Delight ,"Our Delta One Flight to Amsterdam was excellent. The seating arrangement was fantastic and there was so much room, even when the bed was flat. We were able to sleep on the plane because the beds were comfortable and truly flat. The pillows, bedding, and Tumi amenity kits made for an even more comfortable flight. Service was wonderful too."
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Poor seating arrangements.,"Four of us travelled to New Orleans on Dec. 25 and returned on Dec. 30/19...two of our party were a couple that booked on the same booking...but their seats were never together,  this seemed to be the case with numerous groups on the flights with Delta. There were families travelling with children that weren't sitting with their kids! Other airlines I fly with almost always have seats together for those that are booked on the same reservation....is this a ploy to force passengers to pay for an upgrade to GE seated together? If it is then I say 'Shame on Delta'!"
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Good and comfortable trip,"I flew from Copenhagen to Liberia in Costa Rica over Xmas 2019. It was a 22 hour journey and the fact that Delta offered a great level of comfort and service made it so much easier to bear. I was in Economy class, but Delta offers comfortable seats and good legroom. The service was great with lots of food, snacks and drinks on offer. Furthermore you get a great selection of Entertainment (both movies and TV)."
n/a,10,Poor attitude towards passengers,"Poor attitude towards passengers.  They often check in the carry on bags at the gate. However,  based on a nonsense attitude they don't offer this at the kiosk. My wife had a back pain and has to carry her carry on bag all the way to the gate. She has no option and has to let them check the bag to the final destination as they don't have enough space in the cabin."
Date of travel: January 2020,30,Delta took away flight options,"Delta creates a huge pain in the butt for me, when they eliminate the MHT to ATL flight during January-March, forcing me to go thru LaGuardia or Detroit on very small planes (usually with only one bathroom in the very rear of the plane).  LaGuardia is a terrible airport where you spend more time on the tarmac than actually flying to your destination. Flights are most often late (and very late).  To make matters worse they took away the flight in December because Boston airport was complaining their customer counts were down and wanted to force NH flyers to use Logan. Hate this. Time to look for a new airline."
Date of travel: January 2020,20,get to airport very early!,"Our flight was at 7am.  We arrived to MKE at 5am, and printed our tickets.  We waited in line to check in our bags for an hour and half. Only one person checking in bags.  Two people checking in priority passengers' bags. (no line there!) When we got to the front of the line the check in person was going to take another person ahead of us.  I told her we were next, her comment was ""you should be at the airport 2 hours early"".  my comment ""we were!""  We got to security where there was another line.  We had TSA precheck, the only reason we made the flight.    I complained to the airline, summing it up, they were glad we made the flight!  We will not flight DELTA again!"
Date of travel: April 2019,50,Great Airline to fly with !,Very good service.Neat and Clean AircraftAppropriate foodOn time performanceExcellent luggage handling system. Absolutely no-wait on the belt !
n/a,40,"Economy, so normal tight seats, but nice attendants ","We have gotten used to being on uncomfortable flights in economy (rather spend $ on the destination) so even though I wish airlines would make the flying experience better, I did not expect it to be. That part of flying is never fun, especially as we are all tall so our knees hit the seats in front of us even when everyone was sitting upright. The flight attendants were all nice and attentive. The food was better than expected, and probably the best we have had in a while. The welcome Bellini was a nice touch, and the placemats were helpful as well to keep the trays more sanitary.  We were lucky to have smooth flights both ways."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Four separate hour long holds for one booking,"didnt even get to the flight yet, it took 4 four FOUR tries just to book the flight. Nobody knows what happened on your last call. Nobody knows why this or that happened. Cannot explain the extra letters in the name though they were spelled out twice. Nobody knows anything but how to make apologies for hours of soul destroying waste of weekend time it cost me to have multiple errors and system failures and this service not available suddenly and disconnected calls and nobody knows anything. Cancel this rebook that oh which departure time did you need....umm the one you just cancelled maybe. Just pathetic."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Good flight,Had good service and friendly staff on the plane. Briefly the flight was bumpy because of weather but we were warned.
Date of travel: November 2019,10,"Delta failed to treat me like a human being and stole my money, and I'm a gold medallion member","Made the horrible mistake of trusting Delta to fly me to Shanghai on November 23, SNA-SEA-PVG. When in Seattle, I learned that my flight to PVG was oversold by 10 and the gate agent begged for volunteers, offering $700 to take another flight. The gate agent OFFLOADED my bag long before boarding, and it ended up that I was able to get on the flight (albeit in a middle seat). Got to PVG without my bag, and immediately went to lost baggage center and had the agent there (who understandably hardly spoke a lick of English and didn't know Delta's procedures). Called baggage services as soon as I got to my hotel, explained the situation, and asked if anything else needed to be done. Was told that all was set and to file my receipts for expense reimbursement ""as soon as possible"". Got my bag 3 days later after I had racked up the price of my ticket cost in having to replace items that Delta had lost...when I got home I had to deal with moving to a new city immediately for a new job and dealing with the deteriorating health of a terminally ill family member but knew that I had to file my receipts sooner than later (I was not given a deadline and no such deadline was on Delta's terrible complaint webpage). Tried inputting my information only to realize that THE AGENT AT PVG HAD FAILED TO PROPERLY REPORT MY LOST BAG, and that all I could do at that point was email baggage services. Emailed them and received a response that I had exceeded the 21 day deadline to file a claim, even though THEIR AGENT had messed up and NO ONE that I spoke to informed me of such a deadline even when I asked (this deadline was not even on their website but is rather conveniently hidden in their contract of carriage). Responded to them explaining that no one had informed me of either a deadline to file my claim let alone properly report my lost baggage. I explained that I would have certainly acted differently if this deadline had been made clear to me (ie one of their bag service reps told me or gave me more clear instructions), and also explained my personal circumstances that had prevented me from filing the claim earlier regardless of not knowing the timeline...the bag claims manager who responded (Marie Djato) disregarded everything I said and gave me the obviously bogus ""we understand your situation"" and instead gave me a $100 voucher that was literally a slap in the face to me and my loyalty to Delta...immediately booked a cheap ticket with it that I don't ever plan on using for the sole purpose of throwing the voucher away...will never set foot on another Delta plane for the rest of my time on this planet and would literally gift my status and 133k skymiles for free if I could cause I no longer have a use for themTo Marie Djato...shame on you! You are a terrible, incompassionate, incompetent human being who literally allowed one of your elite customers to pay the price for the collective incompetence of your employees and had no compassion or understanding whatsoever for my personal circumstances...you have no place whatsoever in a customer-facing role"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Pampered,"I was re-booked w/DL after my Aer Lingus flight was cancelled. After a hellish experience w/Aer Lingus and how they handled the re-booking, I was pleasantly surprised (and relieved) by DL's efficiency, professionalism and superb service, all the way from the check-in personnel to the in-flight crew. I was in economy and we were met with hot towels and a welcome cocktail... you read that right... a peach bellini :) and then were given a menu with choice of appetizer, main dish and dessert all served on a table cloth (NOT a plastic tray!) and all alcoholic beverages, during and after dinner were included free as well. The (very attentive) stewards told me this is their new standard as on Nov/2019 - to make us feel pampered even if the seats are not as wide... and they said they'll be working on that eventually as well.... they definitely won me over!!!!"
Date of travel: January 2020,20,Bad news for Diamond upgrades,"Well, I struggled to maintain my Diamond Medallion status on Delta this year -- plenty of miles but had to spend more dollars for tickets. But I recall that I was not given a complimentary even once last year. So rather than buy first round trip to SLC from JFK I decided to wait until 5 days before my return flight to get upgraded as there were plenty of seats left. Guess what? About 6 days before the flight, my app showed no seats available in first, even for dollars or miles. Hmmmm. So I got on line  with my wife's login and was able to buy a first class ticket on that flight with a choice of several open seats! The rules keep changing, folks. And fellow DIamonds...beware. Use your dollars or miles when you book, or be stuck in back."

Date of travel: January 2020,50,Flight to Atlanta Georgia aboard Delta 767-300,"We caught the Red-Eye flight from Salt Lake City to Atlanta Georgia.  The Boing 767-300 is a sizable jet with room for some 261 passengers, and this flight was completely booked.  The attendants were very congenial and helpful.  The flight was smooth with great take-off and landing, and being a tall 6’-4” fellow, it was amazingly comfortable in the main Cabin.  It was a great flight over-all."
n/a,20,Delta isn't any different,"I don't know why I'm surprised that Delta isn't any different than any other major corporation with little care for customers.What prompted this review was after I attempted to book a flight on their website.My mother has agreed to fly here to help out because my wife is due to give birth soon. And I only get 2 weeks paternity leave.I'm trying to use what miles I have to mitigate cost, but with only 14k I have to mix it with cash.No prob. I have a gift card!On the site it says ""eCredit"" isn't combinable with miles...but surely that isn't the same thing as a gift card.Well, after being on hold for 55 minutes, I learned they ARE the same thing. So Delta does not allow you to combine even gift cards with miles. Although the language isn't explicitly clear on their site.Yet another frustrating situation trying to work things out as the ""little guy"" at the mercy of big corporate."

Lauderdale, flight departures and arrivals were either on time or early.And the in-flight entertainment is so varied and extensive that it`s no problem killing time."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Do not book with Delta Airlines (Bate and Switch Scam),"After booking with Delta direct on line 9 months ago Delta has changed our flight times 4 times making it over an hour eariler and earlier each time. Now we need to leave our home at 3:00 am to make a 7:30 am flight. Delta would charge us a $200 change fee for each seat if we wanted to change our flight times but Delta dosen't feel it owes us any condieration at all for the hardship its inflicting on us. No seat upgrade, no reduction in price, no booking us on another flight at the orgional time, no concideration at all!! They booked us on a more expensive flight took our money and then moved us to cheeper flights with no price adjustment. Stay away from this airline."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Beyond Dreadful,"This was a beyond dreadful experience from start to finish. The airport was total chaos. No one seemed to be in charge. We had checked in on line and had boarding passes, but it still took us an hour just to drop off our bags. Our flight was delayed multiple times. The information that Delta sent us by email, the information on the electronic boards, the electronic information on the notice boards at the gate, and the information given by the people at the gate changed constantly, was inconsistent and contradictory. No one knew what was going on and no one was in charge. Our departure was delayed by 2 hours, and it was only when we were on the plane that the pilot emerged and apologized. It turned out that a bunch of people had not bothered to turn up for work, so there weren't enough Delta staff on duty to handle everything. American Airlines, on the other hand, seemed to have no problem. One of our party was flying American back to NYC, and he was able to check in a huge load of skis and equipment in 15 minutes. It took us an hour to check in nothing. Our flight was so delayed that the crew ran out of flying hours, so we had to stop in Minneapolis to pick up a new crew. We ended up at JFK at 1:30 am, 5 hours after our our 8:30pm scheduled arrival time. And, needless to say, there was nothing to eat on the plane except ""snacks."" And not a word of apology from Delta except for the pilot at Jackson who was so obviously embarrassed by this inexcusable performance by Delta.Delta, who sends me many questionnaires after flights asking me to review my flights with them, intelligently has not sent me anything after this disaster.Why would anyone in their right mind fly Delta if there was another choice?"
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Start out the year just right,"Delta knew how to handle holiday travelers on a fully booked flight. Patience and an authentic smiles were served with nutritious snacks, entertainment and flexibility with the seating."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Terrible tactless airline and flight attendants,"I had a terrible experience during this flight from a flight attendant by the name of Abigail. There was a cat thatbwas in the seat behind my party. Both my mother and I are highly allegic to cats and asked to be moved. Several flighta attendants reported that they would be looking for a way to handle the situation. Abigail was he first to come back and report that the would move the lady with the cat. During this time another flight attendant came and also said that she haid found two seats for us in the front of the cabin and Abigail told her no that she would prefer to move the lady with the cat instead so the other flight attendant left. Abigail then statted ro the lady dont even worry about it, you will have a better seat anyways. I then asked Abigail if she could take the lady around the other way as she moved her up front so that she was not directly walking past me and she declined. Abigail proceeds to tell me the the cat is already underneath the seat so it does not matter if she walks by with the cat. I then attempted to inform her about flying dander that could trigger our allergies. Abigail continued to be argumentative and stated no she will not walk on yhe other side, the cat is in a carrier. I then replied that it doesnt matter and Abigail again replied that the car is already under my seat so I should have no other concerns. She then took the lady up front. During the flight my breathing was shallowed and i had to take my rescue inhaler two times during the flight. My mom also had two seizures triggered by allergies as well. When I attempted to hit the call light to notify the flight attendants that my mother was having a siezure it took longer than 4 minutes for someone to come. When someone did come they did not ask if she was ok but simply if she would be able to complete the flight safely. I reported thag ahe would be fine but requested that a wheelchair be available at landing as her left side was temporarily paralyzed. Also during the flight Abigail was one of the servers on my side and often times completely overlooked me in supplying things. I would have to ask other flight attendants to get things for me. She also hit me several times with rolling carts. I am not sure if this was intentional but guven the history I would mot put it past her. I also overheard her telling another crew cabin member that my mother and I were trying to make the lady with the cat feel bad. I believe that my interactions with her were racially motivated and were completely unprofessional and unnecessary. Never flying this airline again. Id rather pay triple the price than support this airline."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,DELTA stands for “ Don’t expect luggage to arrive “,"Me and my fiancé planned this lovely trip to paradise island Bahamas (Atlantis). Only for Delta to ruin it by losing my bag... Yes that’s right we got there and the bag never came and they still have not found it. Now I understand things happen, but what really blows my mind t is how a company as big as delta has chosen to handle the situation. First not a single person has reached out, 2nd the right hand doesn’t know what the left hand is doing. 3They refuse to refund me for my trip, 4 I have been on the phone for 2 hours now getting through the prompts and getting the buck passed, 5 their process for claiming lost items is a joke and nearly impossible to navigate for even the most tech savvy. Pay less for spirit! I have been a loyal sky miles customer for years but never again!"

Date of travel: December 2019,10,lousy everything,"I spent $,1200.00 to fly first class.  $1,200.00 down the airline toilet   I was treated like first class baggage.   To begin with, when I was a t Westchester County airport, they boarded everyone, at the same time, including first class.  I thought that I would enjoy the benefits of a good meal on board.  Instead, I was treated to chips, bananas, cookies, etc. (all complimentary) and was told that there would be no meal.  In first class, We have out own bathroom.  However, the curtain between first class and coach was NEVER CLOSED and I had to wait in line behind coach passengers using the first class bathroom.  The desk people at Westchester County looked like they had been plucked off of a street corner.  Dirty uniforms, messy, nappy hair and attitudes to match!  At least in the stopover in Atlanta, they resembled flight attendants.  On the way home, I went to check my bag outside and the Delta employee who was doing the bags said to me ""let me see some I.D.""  Not ""Pardon me, may I please see some identification, etc.""  Just rude as hell.  The flight back was even worse.  On the last connecting flight, there were no first class bathrooms.  There was only one bathroom way in the back of the plane and I had to wait and literally ""hold it in"" until the flight attendant finished serving drinks all the way back to the end of the plane.  After she finished, she came up to me and said, rudely, ""Now you can piss.""  Delta can go piss as far as I am concerned.  Never again will I fly your airline.  Never again!"
n/a,50,"More room, more comfortable","Flew international from Zurich, Switzerland to JFK and the Delta flight and felt i had more leg room and under seat storage space than my flight there on KLM. Delta had personal inflight TVs with many options to choose from. The food was good for each meal with free alcohol. The stewards were nice and accommodating. KLM flight to Zurich was tight and I felt I had less leg room and less under seat storage. My ear plug connection wasn't working right therefore made my experience watching movies terrible and their TV selection was not great. Food was okay. Flown Delta before internationally and would book again with them over any other airline. I won't book with KLM again."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Delta Air Lines - Perfectly Fine,Flew Delta (Boeing 767) from Salt Lake City to Paris (CDG) and then from CDG to Seattle in late December 2019.The flight was fine.  Nothing out of the ordinary and no issues. The air line food was better than normal.
Date of travel: December 2019,20,Retire the CanadairJets,Our recent flight from Atlanta to Charleston was just painful - these planes are simply too small to have 76 seats stuffed in them - they need to be replaced with something with either more space (both seating and overhead) or fewer seats and more overhead space.  My daughter’s carryon had to be gate checked because the overheads aren’t high enough and my carryon had to go in sideways as the overheads are too shallow.  To their credit the cabin crew was friendly and did their best to make people comfortable.  The bottom line is that these planes need to be retired.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Fast and friendly,"We had an extremely early flight and two checked bags and we breezed through check-in and security. Our flight was as scheduled and the flight attendants were super friendly and generous with the snacks. Great movie selection there and back. The only negative is my daughter's screen did not work (there and back- what are the odds) but other than that, everything was smooth and timely. Flight back came in 30 minutes early."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,"Trip to Cancun, Mexico","I fly exclusively Delta since it is convenient to use this airline out of Detroit. Especially when flying to Cancun, there are direct flights which are a lot more convenient then connections. In winter there could be de-icing issues and then a connecting flight might not wait for me. Have experienced that before. I am fortunate to sit in the front section where the seats are wider and comfortable and the service is good. In flight entertainment always offers lots of movies to watch. I cannot compare other airlines with Delta, but I am content to fly with them for now."
Date of travel: June 2019,50,Brilliant!!!!!,"I had the opportunity to fly to Asia on Delta Airlines from Minneapolis though their new hub in Seoul twice this past year and connect on to Hong Kong and Shanghai as well as a stay in South Korea.  The New Delta One cabins are amazing, service and food are world class, and the new Terminal 2 is gorgeous. Connections with partners Korean Air and China Eastern were flawless and also offer and excellent business class experience and lounges.  Highly recommend Delta via Seoul to Aisia!"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,mid-November flight,"Fling was once convenient and at least semi-pleasant. As flights became more affordable, and as security concerns continued to rise worldwide, that is no longer so. The best one can hope for is a flight that leaves on time and arrives on time, with your luggage arriving at the same location as you are WHEN you arrive. I learned from the TSA employee that, in terms of flights, airlines consider the holiday season as beginning in mid-November. The TSA screening line I encountered on Friday, Nov 15 bore that out. Having said all that, I always check my luggage because I do not wish to fight for cabin space for it. I find there are many inconsiderate folks engaged in this sort of battle. My flight to/fro Philly was ok. My expectations are low. The only real issue I had was when I returned to Cincinnati (CVG) on Nov 17 and the carousel for the luggage was changed without any notice or announcement."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Horrible flight line,First time flying Delta flight delayed despite no issues with weather. Overhead compartment first flight line I've ever traveled couldn't fit my small carry on bag. 0/10 to recommend.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,The long flight,"I doesn't get much longer than a flight from Montana to Kenya. I've flown Delta in the past and wasn't looking forward to this flight, 27.5 hrs one-way and 37.5 on the return. As  in most flights the seating is too small however there was a great staff, great selection of movies and I ate every meal they offered. They were tasty and hot. Some of the flight also included a complimentary alcoholic beverage as well as the usual selection of non-alcohol. Withall that and the complimentary head phones, blanket and pillow, flying Delta Air lines was pleasant and renewed my faith in traveling with them."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Nonstop Home,"This nonstop from Cancun to back home in New England is quick and painless.  And US Customs & Immigration has small lines.  Remember that when you re-enter the country from abroad, you must go through these authorities at your first US landing.  So if you connect in Chicago or Atlanta there will be monster lines, and you'll have to re-check your luggate.  Delta's nonstop is only on Saturdays."

Date of travel: January 2020,50,Heading to Dallas,"Taking a flight these days can be a stressful time, am I getting to the airport in enough time to catch my flight, how long will it take me to get through security, will I make my connection, did my bag make it, am I landing on time to make my meeting.  Add to this a flight to a major city and at times it can be overwhelming.  This flight was delayed boarding waiting for the crew.  You could feel the apprehension growing.  Here is where the Delta associates made all the difference,  From the gate agent who kept delivered timely information on boarding to the flight attendants who kept the boarding process moving forward to the pilots who again delivered accurate and timely information on what to expect, by the time the boarding process was complete the apprehension and stress previously felt was gone.  The flight itself was smooth despite some turbulence and landed back on schedule.  To cap it off the bags were on the carousal by the time I deplaned.  Overall not a good flight but a great flight."
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Good flights but....,The flights were comfortable.  There was plenty of overhead or at least I got my bag in there without issue.  Everyone was very nice from the bag drop to check in to boarding.The problem is the seat size. The seats are so close together that you are left with no choice but to grab the seat in front of you to stand up bothering the person in front of you.  There is virtually no way to get up without grabbing the top of the seat in front.No leg room.  The tray table barely came down to horizontal without banging into my legs and stomach. One huge thing is using the CLEAR system to bypass a long line to check my boarding pass and ID. Breezed right through. More places should get this.
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Horrible Airline,"I purchased Comfort Plus Seats for all of my flights directly from the Delta website on a holiday vacation. The first flight had a stop in Atlanta which failed horribly. Once we landed we awaited a airplane in front of us to move to allow us to use their terminal. It could not move due to maintenance issues (or so they say).  Myself and my family were waiting for at least 20 minutes until the other airplane finally was able to move to allow us in. In this time we missed the connecting flight to our destination (which was supposed to be landing in Allentown that night). We instead had to wait in line after a much hurried run with two adults and two children under the age of 6 to the next terminal when we asked the attendant if the plane left. It did and he instructed us to to go where they handle these instances at customer service. There was a large line and we were instructed to go onto the phones which only handled booking the next flight for the morning and not the hotel. My husband had to wait in a second line while I watched over the kids for at least 2 hours to get a hotel booked (this is 12AM mind you) for that night at a hotel nearby. We were at least given a flight the next morning around 7am and a hotel stay which had a very long line to even check in and this took nearly 2 hours in itself (this is bringing us to about 2am). We had nearly 3 hours of sleep for Christmas Eve! On the way back from Allentown our plane was immediately late by 2 hours. Our stop over in Michigan had a 40 minute layover time in between flights (the same as the first to which we missed). We had to book another flight then to Michigan to connect to our destination in Denver and ended up waiting in the Michigan airport for 4 hours!. Again, this is with two children under 6 and comfort plus seats that I spent extra hundreds of dollars on to not get them in the end anyway. If the trip had gone correctly it would have been leaving by 130 and arriving in Denver at 530. Instead we had to leave by 330 and get to Denver by 12AM! Keep in mind we arrived at the airport for our first flight by 12pm to make sure for enough time. This is a 12 hour time span in the airport that day! The first plane on the way back was small and not taken care of well as the seats were ripped and the airplane attendants were also rude. The second plane was a large plane that was extremely hot and we were not given the seats that I paid for. The air conditioner had to not be working because I would get cold air in about 10 minute increments. We were promised a food ticket to which was not given and the attendant insisted to my husband (in a very rude way) when he asked for a par of earbuds ""its on my sir, its only two dollars but ill give them away this time"" and huffed off like she was doing us a good deed. What about the hundreds of dollars lost when we had to arrive in Philly airport the first time instead of ABE? We had to drive an hour to Allentown on the first trip just because they did not have another flight to ABE! What about the Comfort Plus seats I had paid for that were not taken care of? Where is that money huh! What about the time that it took! I never had to go through this before with a airline but here you have it! NEVER FLY DELTA!!! Merry Christmas (happy holidays) and save yourself a world of heartache!!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Always consistant,"My experience is that Delta is always on time.  Their staff is always courteous and accommodating.  The food is better than other airlines I have used.  The Captain and Co-Captain are informative from the flight deck.  They actually seem to appreciate our business.  I will not fly any other airline if at all possible.  The few times I have used another carrier, I was disappointed and confirmed in using Delta."
Date of travel: January 2020,30,Small aircraft however staff DO NOT control carry-on baggage sizes,"I can appreciate the size of the aircraft(CRJ700) for these shuttle style flights, however, what I find unacceptable is staff letting passengers board with oversized baggage (even though they would not have to pay extra) which cannot fit AT ALL in a CRJ and that passengers like myself have to experience people with NO spacial ability trying to fit it in and then eventually either dropping it on people under (me) or giving up then having to put the luggage on their lap (over and on top of me) until boarding is completed so the luggage can be taken off the aircraft and put in the belly of the luggage area in the belly of the plane ."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,A Hometown business with quality,"When Delta prices are competitive we try to use our hometown airline. Southwest sometime beats them significantly in price on flights we do to Michigan, so we do use them too - but have found Delta still has better service overall. With that said we have found we have to buy the Comfort + seat so we have a small bit of leg room with Delta. Overall not sure flying will every again be the ""fun"" part of a vacation anymore, regardless of the airline you fly."

Date of travel: January 2020,20,Disappointed,"As a first class passenger LAX to MEX you are treated on the ground as a coach traveller.  Outbound after the as required early check - in, no lounge access is allowed. In MEX,  the AeroMexico lounge does allow first class passengers, but not Delta.  On my return after arriving in LAX and re-checking my bags, I wanted to standby for an earlier flight from LAX to SFO (it was a multi city booking).  I had called the day before and was told I could confirm at seat for another $75, and after an hour with customer service, was told there was an error message and I would have to do this in LAX.   At the re-check counter they added me to standby, but if I didn't make the flight I was facing a 5 hour layover.  I went to the lounge to wait.  And was told that First from US to MEX is not counted as eligible for the Lounge. Because they couldn't accomodate me in the lounge with a potential 5 hour layover, I was left to sit on the floor (the gate was packed) beside the gate waiting to see if I was approved for standby.  With 23 seats open Delta offered no preference for a full fare flyer, I was not guaranteed a seat until minutes before take off, and while it was exit row (my in the air exp is another story), the airline still gave me no priority boarding status. My recommendation: Never pay full fare for first class to MEX.  I'm from Atlanta and always favor Delta over other airlines, but this experience was extraordinarily disappointing, particularly after paying full fare for first (not with miles).  In the air:  LAX to MEX on Dec 25 on the 7p flight offered coursed dinner service, but the flight attendant on this 3 hour flight gave us all of the courses on one tray. They also let everyone in coach use the first class head until well into the flight.  It feels snotty to mention this now and also did to ask the flight attendant to close the curtain, but on the other hand, this is exactly what I paid for.    The seats do not go flat and there are no privacy screens between seats. On the return MEX to LAX at 935a on Jan 4, service was equally scant but they did limit the head to the passengers in first.  I miss the days of champagne offered before take off and warm nuts served once in the air.  Same seating style - just larger than coach reclining seats.  LAX to SFO: 3:10p on Jan 4, middle seat exit row - surprisingly good legroom and seat width.  So there's that.  Sorry Delta, but you failed in my book, with the exception of getting me on the earlier flight."
Date of travel: January 2020,20,No room,I think of someone is oversized they need to make them pay for two seats. It's not cool I had to lean into the isle my whole trip. The person next me rolled half way into my seat making it miserable for me!! I would think Delta would recognize this and move me or them. I too am a paying customer I should be entitled to some comfort.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Christmas in Memphis,I love flying Delta. I choose them over all other airlines when I can. Once again both flights were ahead of schedule and had no problems. the crew was great. But since this was one of thos little commuter jets there were no movies.

After you took my money you basically left me on my own as I did most of the work, honestly that is not how you or anyone should run a business but if you are looking at a one time customer that is fine.ThanksTywe will never use this process again and further more on the return the private transfer was late but we had plenty of time because the flight was delayed.

Date of travel: August 2019,50,A Wonderful Introduction to Flying,This was the first flight for my thirteen year old grandson; he really enjoyed it. We really enjoyed the class update with more legroom and bigger seats.  Everyone was very helpful to us
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Great service,I flew to Salt Lake City from Minneapolis and back all in 1 day. The rides were the smoothest I’ve ever been on. The flight attendants were super nice and the best feature was the tv screens for each individual person. You can watch movies or tv shows or even play games. It made the 3 hour flight seem like an hour. I highly recommend Delta!
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Over booked,I did like the flight The seats were comfortable but for the next 3 days my shoulder was in great pain. Why is seats so small? Food is so high in price arm rest are tight I did like the movies on the plane.  Crews always know their jobs
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Family Christmas,Our experience with Delta was very good. We were treated with kindness and respect. I would fly with them anytime. I recommend them to anyone. We flew in a 757 and we had good leg room and we were treated to soft drinks and snacks.
Date of travel: December 2019,30,no events,Smooth flight even though the weather service was calling for thunderstorms. We expected turbulence but we managed to outrun the weather.
Date of travel: January 2020,50,"Great service, knowledgeable staff","First of all: We had missed our flight (due to a collision on our way to the airport and we had to wait for a state trooper to arrive, which took more than 2,5 hours (!!)) from Miami to AMS and I called Delta’s hotline for help once arrived at the airport. The next day we could fly to AMS via NYC. Jessica, who attended us and made this possible was knowledgeable, accurate and pro-active. She waivered the extra costs due to the circumstances which I thought was very thought- and helpful! Customer service at its best.The flight was again great. Seats in economy are fine, more spacious than with KLM f.e. Good entertainment (new releases etc), good food (extensive menu with good choices), a refill is no problem and small items are a bonus (like a little toblerone chocolate before landing). How nice is that. A small gesture that makes a difference, especiallycompared with their other airlines as KLM/AF. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable.Great flight, again👌🏼"
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Ft Lauderdale to Pasco Washington,"The flight itself was Ok.  The time between connections was arduous (3 hours)!  Of course the small leg room was not fun.  At 75 years old, cramping is going to happen.  No way to avoid it.  I can't blame the flight attendants but for sure the grabbed at more money by corporate  is unforgivable!"
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Horrible customer service,I bought my daughter a ticket home for Christmas and when I got the confirmation I forwarded to her. Neither of us read it until a few days before her flight. I had put my last name not hers. She was in a panic so I said no worries I’ll take care of it. I called and told them the mistake. All I needed was to correct the last name everything else is correct. They wouldn’t do it. I spoke to a supervisor who said they would get fined. Really??? So I said ok the flight is sold out and figured they charge me like $50 to fix it and just cancel and rebuy her ticket. Nope! They said it was now $300 for the same ticket I paid $99 for. No help what so ever. And this is why I always fly southwest. Nicest people and always accommodating! Too bad they don’t fly out of Savannah. You could take a courtesy lesson from them Delta cause you suck!
Date of travel: December 2019,50,"By today's standards, this is almost luxury","Everything is handled efficiently.  Service personnel are uniformly cheerful.  Seats are comfortable.  Having an American Express Platinum Card provides access to the airline lounge during long layovers which is a fantastic benefit, since they provide wifi, good food, and comfortable space"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Flight to and from Florida,"Flights were on time, in fact, early in arrival.  Snowing on the way back, but wearrived early.  Plane was clean, snacks and purchased snacks were good.  Am flyingto Europe and the Middle East later this year and using Delta again.  Used milesfor Florida.  Good deal!"
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Come fly Delta,"Delta is always good for us and we travel two to four times a year. We like Delta for International, also."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Vacation,Very good service from flight attendants. Love the number of options for movies. Check in was wasy and flight was on time.
Date of travel: July 2019,50,"Flight from JFK, NY to Edinburgh, Scotland","We flew ""comfort plus"" on Delta Airlines.  Seats were right behind first class and also included preferential boarding.  They were larger with more leg room.  These flights were booked with a company called SkyLuxe and were $400 cheaper than through Delta direct.  Flights to and from Europe were on time and very pleasant."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Well done,On time. Gates well tended. Easy to make connecting flight. Comfortable seats. Agents pleasant. Luggage well handled. Boarding went smoothly
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great Flight!,"First and foremost, we got there (and home) safely.  That is the most critical piece of any flight!  But the flight was also smooth, service was friendly, in-flight entertainment was entertaining, and we were on time there and back.  All good!  Will be flying Delta again."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Two awesome flights,"From check-in outbound to baggage claim on return, Delta was great. Main cabin upgrades were helpful and made a long flight tolerable. I used wheelchair assist, help was immediate."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Okay flight,"Check in was a breeze, as was boarding.  Flight was on time.  No problems.  Airline personnel professional and courteous."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Back to the US,"Excellent service, great cabin crew.Making people to feel comfortable.American courtesy and professionalism.That is how I know DL.Go Delta ,go....."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,On our way to a cruise,"Because of peanut allergie ,one pax, whole cabin got brezels.First drink got served after est. 1.5 hrs on board.Deicing, I assume ,because nobody  explained.People pay premium money, to fly Business/ First.So far my worst expiririence with DLDl you can do much better..."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Flight to hawaii,"Hmmm, I always liked delta for their high standard compared to other airlines. But this time, i’m Slightly confused. First of all, delta one vs first class - was told same thing, in the market where’s no delta one, it’s first class. Was told I can still use the lounge, showed up at EWR delta lounge, the guy with stone face told us no mam, this is not a delta one market - how am I as average traveler suppose to know? Unnecessary cliche. Expect meal ordering service like Air France in the plane, but no - you pick one of 2 options and meals were not that good, area of improvement. Confused, confused, and I honest don’t think first class is cheaper than delta one. Flight to Hawaii is farther than flight to Europe, can’t use lounge doesn’t make any sense. Most flight attendants are very nice, but there were a couple just provides minimal service, my husband on the other isle received drinks 3 times while i’m Sitting in a different isle literally thirst to...only 12 movies to select from, no news..."
Date of travel: December 2019,30,The usual,"The flight was safe and on time, which is most important. The seating is cramped, and the boarding process is chaos, but all this is par for the course if you fly economy."
Date of travel: January 2020,20,Rude Flight Attendent,"I will start by saying the flight itself was fine. It was a smooth flight. It was on time. The seats were comfortable. There was one flight attendant who was quite rude. We were amongst the last passengers to board the flight and there were many empty overhead bins. We put one of our bags in one of the empty overhead bins and the flight attendant began chastising us in front of all the other passengers because she had previously, unbeknownst to us, made in an announcement to not use those bins because they were for the last passengers boarding the plane. We were in the last group of six people to board the plane. Later in the flight this flight attendant continued to come to us and give directions that were unnecessary. My husband‘s backpack was about 2 inches showing from under the seat and she made a big deal about him putting it under the seat correctly. When I declined snacks she made a big deal for all the other passengers around to hear about me saying no I did not want to snack. Her name was Mary she was the flight attendant from the back of the plane and if she is the face of Delta then Delta is in trouble."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Dirty plane,"There was a peanut on my seat when I arrived, good job I am not allergic to nuts. Plane looked like it had never been cleaned. I could see down the window seat in front. The food material there had been there some time as it was producing spores ( pic 1) looked down side of my seat (pic 2) and found a biscuit! Cabin steward insisted on taking our coats out of overhead locker to create more bag space for other customers, emptying the contents of our pockets over the cabin. This was meant to be premium economy, not a patch on the premium economy experience on the second leg of our journey with Virgin,which was fantastic. Cannot understand why Virgin partners with this airline. At least this flight was only 40 minutes. Will avoid in future if possible."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Good,"The flights were good and came in early both going and coming back. The staff was nice some more than others.  The snacks were okay. I would of liked to have almonds like I could get on the first flight but the other three flights did not offer those.( Cookies or Cheezits) The seat were snuggle and if you are tall like my husband 6'2"" do not seat by the window, getting up can be tricky. The tickets prices were high I thought but we did have a choice, family emergency."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Very horrible experience!,I'm so disgusted with Delta right now.I dealt with two very dumb ladies called Heather and Yolanda..absolutely horrible.They have zero knowledge of how to do their jobs.Evil witches!if you see these two names at the counter..run for your life!very useless
Date of travel: December 2019,20,Warning if you are disabled,"I""m writing this on behalf of my father as he is unable. Although he is not in a wheelchair, he needs his walker to get around (very slowly) so I always request wheel chair service when he flies. GRR airport was great as always but the help he (didn't) receive in Atlanta was very sad. He asked the wheel chair attendant 3 different times to stop at the rest room and each time they would just pass by. They dropped him at his connecting gate and left. My 85 pound legally blind mother had to push him back to the restroom, one of the three that he passed by that Atlanta's help failed to stop at. I realize everyone is very busy these days but put yourself in that disabled persons situation...just for a moment. I bet you would think differently"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,winter getaway,"The flight was very pleasant. We had a short (40 minutes) layover in Atlanta. The staff was very helpful, However, my wife lost her gloves on the flight from Atlanta to Daytona Beach. WE contacted the airline but they have not been able to locate them."
Date of travel: October 2019,20,Ancient aircraft and poor service,"What a terrible service, the Delta Airlines Boeing 757 was as old as the arc, it was worn out, cramped seating with very limited toilet facilities.  The service on a flight which lasts nearly 6 hours was very poor, there was no hot food and the snacks that were served were poor with a very limited selection.  After an excellent service on a Boeing 787 with Virgin Atlantic from London to Los Angeles this was very disapointing.  We suggest customers use Hawaiian Airways who use modern airbus aircraft, we flew with them to Las Vagas on our return trip."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Recommend,"I’ve flown with Delta numerous times and I’ve never had any issues. The flight attendants are kind and always helpful. I always carry a carryon and a personal item so that I never have to check my luggage. If open seats are available they will allow you to move so you don’t have to sit next to anyone. When you fly long distances they have free movies available, and their movie selection is perfect. I highly recommend flying with Delta!"
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Final leg home after a long International trip,"Best legroom of my entire trip. Food/snack as decent, and was able to watch a movie. Plane seemed a bit cold, though."
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Thoroughly enjoyable and comfortable flight,"Flying Premium Economy, or Comfort-Plus seemed heavenly after a cramped flight prior to this one. Decent food, ample legroom, and nice entertainment featured."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Nice intercontinental flight.,"If offered on your Delta flight, opt for premium economy called Comfort Plus. The seats aren't much wider but have more recline and better legroom than standard economy or main cabin."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Decent flight during holiday season; overbooked and fully packed airplane,"This flight was aboard a Boeing 737-900, and was typical Boeing cramped seats with poor legroom. Thankfully, this was the first leg of an international flight to Vienna, Austria. Clean airplane, attentive attendants, but didn't make up for a basically uncomfortable airplane in standard main cabin economy."
Date of travel: July 2019,40,"Grateful to have a midday flight, non-stop.",It was fine.  I really appreciated a mid day non-stop flight from PDX to DTW. I have not other pertinent comments.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Awesome service,Best customer service on any flight every mile of the way. Wheelchair service was waiting at each stop right next to the door of the plane.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Delta is just hard to beat,All was good. I was very disappointed that they did not serve first class a meal going or coming. We flew a few years back a was served a wonderful meal hot towels and so on with glass ware
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Great flight and times,"Had a great time, price and transfer time. We will become Delta members and fly them every time. We were so happy with them we book flights for all three of our kids and our Grandchild as a way of them getting to the island with us."
Date of travel: January 2020,30,"On time flight, flight attendants need customer service training","Okay flight -on time even though terribly cramped.  There were a couple of unsmiling, almost rude flight attendants.  We had to ask for a snack since they did not offer, pushed the cart into me - never apologizing and truly they seemed morose."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Cheaper with Delta ticket,"I booked a Delta Air Lines seat on a WestJet code-share flight. Although the flight was operated by WestJet, there was a US$29 saving by purchasing a Delta seat."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Easy Transfer in Atlanta,"Travelling from Australia to Charleston, via LA and Atlanta, had us a little nervous, knowing LAX well.  (That Airport has improved - but traffic getting into it is worth than downtown Bangkok or Jakarta.).  Atlanta is a very well organised airport, and we reached our gate in plenty of time.  Best thing we liked was the 'at gate' offer to take hand luggage in the hold.  This may not be popular if you're ONLY travelling with hand luggage - but we'd already checked suitcases - so we took the free offer.  It made a real difference on a smaller plane with limited room in overhead bins.  We received not only the baggage tag at the gate, but a text when the bag was on the plane AND one when it was being delivered to the carousel.  Delta did a great job, and we appreciated that little something extra."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Great Service,"First time flying with Delta. Can honestly say they are fantastic.  Economy class was good, better than other airlines I have flown with. The service from the flight attendants was Wal good as was the food which was plentiful.ould definitely fly with Delta again, would recommend."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Exceptional Service on the ground and in the air.,"I am a committed Delta medallion flyer. Be it domestic or international the service has always been excellent.The are very easy to reach and most helpful, when I call.They have gone out of their way to either get me on a earlier flight when I arrive at the airport early or when there is a delay."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Great flight and seating,"First of all Delta is my go to airlines for trip because they seem to fit my schedule and desired destinations. This flight out of Seattle on October 31 to Seoul was part of a trip to Vietnam. I paid extra for premium seating as it was a long flight, in seat 21B. All was great and the cost for premium was well worth it for this old guy. The big or should I say little problem came up when I went to use bathroom. The bathrooms on this Airbus 350 or 300-900 were so very small that a 12 year old child would be cramped! I feel sorry for anyone bigger than say 125 pounds to try and use these bathrooms. This is once being a man paid off as no setting down required. Now I'm not a big fan of Airbus, give me a nice Boeing plane any day and I'm happy. Other then this one issue with tiny bathrooms the flight was great and as usual Delta staff from start to end were super. The trip was also amazing but next time I'll look for a different plane flying Delta. Happy travels."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,"Atlanta to Joberg, 17 hours made tolerable by Delta even in the back of the bus","I do not fly Delta often but this is the best flight from the US to South Africa. Delta has added many perks and extras for this flight which are greatly appreciated due to the length, even in the back of the bus where I fly, economy. You get a free Bellini to start the trip, then free entertainment during the entire flight. There are several meal services and I must say the selections are very good. The flight attendants are constantly working to make sure your flight is as enjoyable as possible. The two issues I do have are not with this flight but when you must return from Johannesburg on Flight DL 201  due to the multiple levels of never-ending security that you pass through, even at the gate, in Johannesburg. Also, if you do not fly Delta regularly you are the very last to board and you risk no room for your carry-on luggage."
Date of travel: January 2020,20,Trainer,"Most airlines now when pre-boarding allow active duty and military veterans to board after children and families, but before first class as a sign of respect for the service. However, Delta is different. Veterans do not receive that honorific with Delta, which was disappointing to learn."
Date of travel: June 2019,10,What a disgrace!,"Our flight had a 90  min layover at JFK.  We were traveling from Buffalo, NY to New Oleans to meet my sister for a vocation.  Our Buffalo flight was delayed due to a GPS problem?   My husband explained to the desk, we were concern about missing our next flight, and that I couldn't RUN to the next gate due to the fact that I had a stress fracture and was in  a walking boot.  We were assured that  a staff member wold meet us with a wheelchair.   When we arrived at JFK, no wheelchair .  We missed our connecting fligt.  Then the FUN began.  We were stuck at JFK for 10 HOURS!   Delta airlines made us go to another terminal.  They told us the wrong gate.  We had to go to one the last gates, then we had to turn around and go one of the first  gates.  As this wasn't bad enough, I was trying to walk in a very busy airport, with a walking boot. (Also I'm not young).  When we finally got on a plane,  we had cheaper seats then what we had paid for.  I complained to the stewardess, and she return with""Your lucky to get a flight at all"",  All day long at JFK, we were told that it isn't Delta's fault for the weather, and we kept telling them, it had nothing to do with the weather.  As the result,  we missed our first day in New Oleanns ana spending time with my sister.  My sister, who flew from California, had to take a cab to the hotel, because we got a rental car.  But it could of been worst;  I met 2 men at JFK, also waitng for thier connecting flight, (not traveling together)  and they were there since the night before!  One of the young man had elected to take a Bus to Toronto, a 14 hourl ride, they too were appose to be on Delta.  Delta gave us, my husband and myself two vouchers for $150.00 towrds another flight.  Well, that's useless, because we were never going to fly on Delta again."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Trip to Dallas,"Not a bad flight at all. Flew First Class, very restful. FC area separated by large panels, not a curtain.  Stewardesses were professional and helpful."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Excellent service with Delta,Lorraine T. Delta rep T Sarasota was fabulous.   Taking time to work out problem with TSA registration and seat selection.  She is an asset to Delta.  Janet S
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Good in-flight experience,Delta's a great airline.  I've flown with Delta twice in the past year - once domestically and once internationally.  The in-flight experience was great.  In-seat TVs were working on all flights.I can't speak to leg room as I'm not that tall and never have under-seat luggage.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,"Great Service, Good Prices, On-Time, What More Can You Ask For","Delta continues to set standard for great service at reasonable price. On my recent flight in economy premium, received nice snack, enjoyed free wifi and seatback movie entertainment, new modern plane and on-time performance. Delta 5+ Stars."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Almost Flawless,"Flight was perfect except that the special-order breakfast did not make it onto the flight.  The flight attendant tried to make it right, but had to revert to only what was available."
Date of travel: July 2019,50,Great flight,"Great flight with nice crew, lovely new aircraft. Our first domestic flight in the U.S., overall very positive. The seat was a lot more comfortable than Lufthansa's long haul flight's."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Business Trip,Flight was as expected and consistent with previous Delta flights. Seating was as expected with Class. Easy connection with adequate layover time. Flight attendants were friendly and available when needed.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Regular Delta flight,We get upgraded with the baby for free since my husband is some priority level. I like that as they give better seats and snacks or drinks for free including wine and beer. Professional service. No bumps during flight. I always wonder if we are lucky with weather or pilots just know how to maneuver.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Flights to Salt Lake City & Honolulu Roundtrip,"Was really impressed with what Delta has done with their seating. Picking my seats was super easy online, their app really handy even to pay for luggage - though that is a charge i would prefer to see go away like southwest. Every seat had a video screen in front of it, where you could pick n choose your entertainment throughout the flight. Drinks and snacks offered on flight negate need to purchase a meal if you don't want to. Friendly staff n crew. Hope NCL uses em on my next flights."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Customer Service is poor at best. They do not care about the consumer they care about money.,I've been flying with delta for a while. I was close to medallion status last year and when I called for a complimentary upgrade to start 2020 they declined (I will be at status within 3 months in 2020) But they were quick to offer a fee of $599 to upgrade to medallion status. I have a flight booked for London and I called to see if they'd do a complimentary upgrade to a seat with more legroom (not even to economy comfort +... just an exit row seat) they also declined and once again offered me to pay the $599 fee to gain status. For a company who I'll be giving a lot of money in 2020 it seems so poorly handled its confusing. If my AMEX didn't give such great rewards I would be flying a new airline today. Delta should be better than this.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Love Flying Delta,I always fly Delta and have never been disappointed.   No complaints at all about the flights.  The Lauderdale Airport needs a major overhaul...and I guess that is in the works.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Great service,"Wow, what a difference with so many other airlines that I have flown with. The staff is friendly and enjoys working for their employer but they also throw in some humor which makes the trip even better.They can’t drive the cart (I think they bumped in to my seat about 12-15 times), but they are very helpful. An extra drink is No problem at all and the food is great. Comfy seating and more seating space than KLM or AF👍🏽. Great experience!"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Very professional and accommodating,"This is the first time I’ve flown on Delta in many years.  Since my last trip, they have dramatically improved in all areas including flight timeliness, baggage handling and tracking, and meal quality.  Flight attendants and gate staff have always been first rate."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Comfortable Flight,Nice flight and the crew was very nice. I would recommend that people fly Delta. You won’t be disappointed
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Easy trip to/from Punta Cana,Great service and no issues. The in-flight entertainment is really nice and helps the time go quickly. Great service to/from JFK to Punta Cana.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Perfection,"Travelled to JFK via Amsterdam.  What a fantastic trip.. not a single hitch.  All flights left on time and the service on board was first class... faultless.  I have never flown with Delta before, but will certainly have no qualms about using the airline in future"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Denver Thanksgiving,"Even with difficult weather conditions, Delta came through. We were only a few minutes late after a snowstorm in Denver"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Wonderful holiday travel experience,"We flew out of MSP on 12/20 and back on 12/28 (the day of the Minneapolis ice storm).  There are no direct flights to TRI, so both trips connected through ATL.  Our flights were all on time and some even landed early.  There was excellent communication from the airline regarding the ice storm in MN.  I have the Delta app, so I was able to monitor our connecting flight from ATL to MSP on the 28.  Our flight attendants were helpful and friendly, and I particularly love the new deep purple uniform options.Excellent experience and look forward to flying Delta again soon!"
Date of travel: January 2020,20,"""Economy comfort"" doesn't always mean that","We paid extra fro this so-called ""premium comfort"" and yet the seats we had did not recline due to being in front of an exit row aisle.  ""Comfort"" should consist of both extra leg room and the ability to recline.  Very disappointed!!"
Date of travel: January 2020,40,On time flight with friendly cabin crew,"My recent experience with Delta out of New York was one to forget, mainly due to the cabin staff which was not only unfriendly but almost rude in how they treated the passengers.This flight out of Detroit to Amsterdam was a whole different story. Staff behind the check-in desk had a friendly word for everyone and were doing their utmost best to help in re-seating passengers and other problems presented.Same onboard the brand new Airbus A350, friendly cabin staff taking their time and willing to assist in every possible way.This making the trip a pleasant one, on a next one I will definitely consider booking Delta again."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,Delta doesn’t understand boarding passes,Why in the world should you have to check in multiple times for the same flight- nothing but delays and frustration. Will choose another airline next time. #DeltaFails
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Kansas City for the holiday,"Round trip to Kansas City on Dec.24th,and then back to Tampa on Dec.30th. Wishing that Delta had a non-stop between these two cities,...would be nice to bypass Atlanta when traveling north from Tampa. Nice airline,...just wish they had some direct flights out of Tampa Bay."
n/a,50,Love Delta,I always fly Delta unless they don't have a reasonable flight to my destination. After bouncing from airline to airline for several years I decided to stay loyal to delta. They don't always deliver the perfect experience but have more than not! This flight to Jamaica was great. The in flight meal was better than expected even for airline food!
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great flights over the holidays,"All of our flights over the busy holiday season were great, Delta is my favorite airline to use and I have not had any issues thus far.  I was flying with a young child and our initial seat assignments were not together.  The gate attendant was able to switch our seats, upgrade us to comfort plus, and we had great flights to our destination.  All of our Delta flights arrived early giving us plenty of time to stop for food before departing on our connecting flight.  I highly recommend flying with Delta and appreciate their willingness to make sure our flying experiences are exceptional."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Experienced the new Delta One Suites,"Great experience flying business in the new Delta One Suites. The best business class experience so far, full privacy in the suite, great food and service."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Delta Airlines Reservations,"Took 4 Delta flights 11/10/13 London - Minneapolis - Las Vegas 15/10/13 Las Vegas - Atlanta - London. The first time experiencing flying with Delta and it had been very disappointing. Like previous comments booked the ticket through KLM/Air France where we've always receive an excellent service. Wondering why they need partnering with Delta to lower their standards. Flight from London to Minneapolis ever rude cabin crew. Nobody at the doorway to welcome the passengers and direct them to their seats. Not one smile and really abrupt cabin crew members. the sole good thing was that they had an honest selection of entertainment a minimum of it kept our mind faraway from their rudeness. Food selection was average. Flight from Minneapolis - Las Vegas more friendly crew and drinks were offered regularly and adequately which made us really surprise for a flight compared to the other for the flight. On our way back at the airport in Las Vegas when checking in again not one smile from the bottom crew or any welcome. Flight from Las Vegas - Atlanta was fine and crew friendly and adequate snacks and drinks served. flight from Atlanta - London we were welcome this point at the doorway and were directed to our seat. An unpleasant surprise was expecting me as soon as I popped down the seat tray ahead of me to read. Yes, it had been messy with food stain and dry sauce thereon from the previous flight and has not been clean which put me off eating. I requested it to be cleaned which was done just about immediately but no apologies whatsoever from the cabin crew. What was more intriguing was the contrast of service between the domestic and therefore the international flights. won't recommend it to any friends or family. And for the first time when I traveled to Delta airline, I received information from reservationsdeltaairlines.com website"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Flying with Delta,Delta provided wonderful service! They were on time with boarding. The flight attendants were very kind. The flight was peaceful.
Date of travel: January 2020,10,13 hours delayed,Flight was delayed because they said pilot was ober hours or something and then they rebooked 2 hours 25 min. Then I missed my second flight and original flight was 5 pm and they rebooked us (me and my pregnant wife) for next day 6 am. Flight was SUNDAY and I missed my work day because of this 13 hours delayed. It is unacceptable. Terrible experience. Their help center staffs are also not respectful.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,"Not the best, not the worst",Flights were ok. Seats lack comfort. Flight attendants were pleasant. Flew through Atlanta. A liitle heads up from the cabin crew as to what gate we were arriving at and where people need to go for connecting flights.  Connection was tight and we had to change terminals. A little too much stress for 8am
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Outdated and of age,"The aircraft was of age and a bunch of entertainment  system were not working. The legroom was, what seems to me - typical Delta Airlines,  at minimum. The flight crew had a few members physically unfit to help in a case of emergency  - sorry, but if your feet are shuffling down the isle you don't belong on a flight crew. The food and service was below par. Seats were dirty at arrival and when puke bags within a six seat surrounding area couldn't be found the flight crew provided a 5 gallon plastic bag.At check in 24 hours earlier, delta showed an aircraft with 3 seat on the window sides with plenty of seats available -  the aircraft used had 2 seats on the outside and was full.The flight crew underestimated flight time so the final meal was rushed to everyone within the last 40 minutes of the flight.It has become more and more visible that Delta doesn't care to me over the last few flights. Their partners KLM and Air France use modern aircraft with plenty of room and very good services. I will make it a point to book their flights in the future"
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Return flight cancelled without communication,"I was to fly NYC to Dublin Dec 23rd and return the 31st. In sprained my ankle and I wanted to fly home for Christmas early. Delta airlines wanted $2000 to change my flight. I ended up.osying $1100 to fly with another airline. 3 days before returning I went to check the time if my return flight. Low and behold Delta airlines have CANCELLED my flight, I was thrown off my flight. Zero communication. Just taken off the flight. They then wanted $1000 to put me back on the flight for the seat I had already paid for. How does this happen??!!!! I was forced to fly with another airline. Delta's customer service left alot to be desired. Why would my seat that I paid for be taken away from me???? Without my knowledge, no communication whatsoever!!! Since returning to New York Delta sent me a questionnaire regarding their customer service. I filled it out straight away expressing precisely how upset I was and how mistreated I had been. I left my number to be contacted & I haven't heard a thing since. I am so dissappointed with there service. I frequently flew Delta and I have 2 Delta platinum credit cards. I won't fly Delta ever again & I will be cancelling both cards at the end of the month."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great customer service!,"We love that Delta offers this non stop flight from Kansas City to Salt Lake City!I have some ongoing lower back & hip pain issues, which makes me slower walking, so when we went up to board as a person who needs extra time, the representative from Delta checked to see if their were 2 seats open, closer to the front of the plane, she did this on her own, we did not ask.  There were, so she printed out 2 new boarding passes for me and my husband, I was very appreciative of this!  The flight was a great flight, we love flying with Delta!"
Date of travel: January 2020,40,Flying Delta is great but the flying attendants were cranky so made it for some long unpleasant trip.,"We flew Delta couple of times and it was always a great experience but this time it was really rather unpleasant. Nothing against the age, but all four ladies taking care of us were rude and unfriendly. So my thoughts were with all the other generation that’s not retirement age and would probably be nicer. Not sure why delta would even hire someone so unpleasant and cranky, seriously don’t mind old grandmothers working but it’s scary when they are just mean. I guess that’s why they worked only the economy section. Those in upper class were way nicer."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,flight with dogs on board,"Flight staff was wonderful, flights were fine. The issue was there were 3 dogs on board.  One sat infront of us in first class. He was wearing a ""support vest"".....not totally what type of support was going on, it was a full sized golden. (extremely well behaved BTW) Not an issue except both of us are allergic to cats and dogs.  Immediately eyes scratchy and itching, the bad bad red color in one eye took a full week with eyedrops to disappear.  Also nec for both of us to use inhailers. Also, there were 2 small under the seat dogs on board in the rear of the plane . We love dogs, but is there not some way to notify when making arrangements that #1- there will be animal nearby or #2- notify the animal owner if making reservation after an allergic person, that they need to pick another flight.  In the past we have had a cat 2 rows back and when we notified the flight crew they moved the cat to the back of the plane.(more circulation)  BUT we were in first class and there was no moving anyone so we did not say a word.  Seems unfair we have no rights as extremely allergic."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Best Airline Experience of my Life!,"Before taking a trip on Delta this year from Cleveland to Bozeman (connecting through Salt Lake City), I had never flown Delta and had been a devout United customer, simply because I had not tried anything else. After flying with Delta, I can assure United that I will never be flying with them again, as long as I can avoid it. Delta takes a different approach to customer service, one that centers around giving the customer what they need as well as what they want. What I was most impressed with while flying Delta is how much nicer the planes are than that of United. The interior was very clean, the seats were comfortable (even in economy), and all of our early arrivals happened because we did not have to deal with any mechanical issues (unlike United, which seems to have mechanical issues 24/7). Secondly, the Airbus 319 that we flew from CLE to SLC was equipped with seat-back entertainment that had hundreds of movies, television shows, games, etc. FOR FREE! United, on the other hand, has cut costs by cutting all seat back entertainment from most domestic flights (and by the way, the movie selection on delta was much better). Thirdly, the customer service on Delta was impeccable. All of the crew members on every flight were helpful and delightful, the food and beverage service was frequent and of good quality, and the pilots were always good about updating the passengers and avoiding rough air when possible. I have never written an airline review before without giving one negative about the airline, but there is a first time for everything, which means I can't think of a single thing on Delta that needs improvement as of now. I urge whoever reads this review to give Delta a shot, even if you have status with another airline. Delta is certainly the best airline in the US, and will eventually become one of the best in the world if they continue to satisfy the customer while also having competitive prices."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Delta has NEVER let me down.,"I'm a huge Delta Air Lines fan, ever since Virgin America was bought by Alaska. Everyone on Delta is very friendly, and unlike other airlines, the flight attendants actually seem to care that you are having a good time. Because I'm from San Francisco, there aren't that many routes I can take non-stop Delta on, so I'll review my trip from SFO -> SLC. When I got on the plane, the flight attendant was very nice. The whole crew, in the front, and back, were having a party on board! They made weather announcements while giving news to us skiers about snow conditions, and during the landing of the flight, when I was taking a video, the lead flight attendant gave me some photography tips! As always, the Delta Sky Club in San Francisco was amazing, and I'd highly recommend checking it out!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great in-flight service!  All my flights and connecting flights were on time.,Delta Airlines is one of my favortie airlines to fly.  The in-flight service is the best! I especially liked the free TV and movie options.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,on time departures and arrivals,"We left on the 6 am flight out of Dayton.  It was 14 degrees outside.  We are always a bit nervous about making our connection to get to Cancun.  The flight was full and the boarding process is not always smooth.  Once on the plane, the pilot said that we were ready for take off but that we needed to stop off to de-ice the plane first.  I really appreciated the pilot taking the time to tell us rather than have us sit and not know how long it would take.  We still made it to our connection early.  On all 4 flights, the staff was very nice.  It was also nice for the kids that there were tv's in the seats.  They had the choice of using their hand held devices or the tv's."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Felt like Premium,"This was hands down the best flight experience we’ve ever had. Lovely touches like the welcome drink and the fact we got a choice of starters made us feel like we were travelling in a higher class than economy. Also, the food was really good! The movie selection was also excellent and the TVs a good size. Time flew by, which is a true compliment as I travel a lot so long haul flights are no longer a novelty and can be a drag."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,a HUGE thanks and Happy New Years wish to the crew 31 Dec 2019 DTW - SLC,"Last day of 2019 was surely going to be busy and hectic and sure enough it came to pass, but the ground crew and especially the flight crew were AWESOME, They were very friendly, kind and definitely tried their best to make you feel a very valued customer.  I don't often express my appreciation for Airlines but when your experience was such to be remembered, then it would be a fail on my part. So, Again, a Happy New Years wish to all of DELTA AIRLINES and especially their DTW- SLC Crew on Dec 31, 2019 and with that..a well deserved THANK YOU !!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Nice Christmas Day Flight,"My wife and I treated ourselves to first class for the holiday.  The flight left on time and arrived on time.  With the meal served in first class and the use of the entertainment system, I was surprised by how quickly the time passed.  The boarding process was very smooth and our luggage arrived at baggage claim shortly after we arrived.  The only issue I had was with the quality of the audio on the movie I watched."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Delta delivers again!,"Delta is definitely the way to fly when traveling across the country.  The pilot kept us informed and avoided bumpy air when possible.  The flight crews are very friendly and professional.  There was a good variety of onboard entertainment which helped the time fly by!  Most importantly, my bags arrived when I did ; )"
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Great Trip in First Class,My wife and I traveled in first class for the first time as a treat to ourselves for the holidays.  It was nice to be able to select between two meal options a couple of days before the flight.I appreciated the text message from Delta when we arrived in Laguardia telling us the status of this flight and the gate number.This flight left on time and arrived a few minutes early in Tampa.
n/a,20,Flying should be an enjoyable journey,I hate to say this but the flight was dirty. The crew were all ready to retire but were allowed an extension to an already extended  retirement. Sad and it's not cheap neither. I thought one of them was going to pass away on my return flight dont they do a health check ahh must be the unions making money.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Honolulu trip,I said if we ever went to Hawaii we’d go first class. It was awesome. First trip had good food. And Delta didn’t disappoint us as always.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Wow! ,Great service. Delicious food with more than enough. Comfortable seats/beds. Pillows and blankets made it easy to fall asleep. Delta One was super.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Continued great service,"Clean airplanes;  personable, professional and competent staff.  We left n time and arrived early.  Good communication from the pilots and crew."
Date of travel: January 2020,20,Color discrimnation,"I traveled from SFO to MSN (Madison, WI) through Delta. I had the connecting flight from Minneapolis−Saint Paul International Airport to MSN. Since my seat ( flight DL 1309, departing at 8:40 pm from MN on 3rd of January 2020) was not allocated I went to the desk requested the woman to allocate my and my wife's seat numbers. She said she was working on that. After an hour I went back to the desk, she rudely responded back with a question Did I call your name. I was waiting for the announcement of my name and it never happened. She announced more than 20 people for seat allocation. After the Boarding announcement, I panicked and went back for seat numbers. She gave a rude look and printed 2 boarding passes with seat numbers different rows for me and my wife. When asked her she said 'thats all I can do'. I'm unable to conclude why such a bad treatment for me and my wife.2 hours of ordeal."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,14 Hours of Misery,"Flying to the US a couple of weeks earlier, I flew Delta’s Premium Select in which I was told is very roomy. It is not. There is more room on Korean Air’s economy flight. So for the return, I upgraded to Delta One. Little did I know this was the worst flight I would have ever taken. First, my seat would not recline even though the seats are supposed to lay flat. My TV stopped working an hour into the flight. I had no entertainment, nor did I have any concept of time since I couldn’t see where I was in flight. In Delta One, you can only turn on the light or call the flight attendant through the monitor. Well, since mine didn’t work I had to get up each time to find an attendant because they were never around. When I first told the flight attendant that my television did not work, her response to me was, “I am not a mechanic”. The meals were cold. I had to use my flashlight on my phone to see. The door to my seat got stuck where I had to jam it open. And the charger worked intermittently throughout the flight. And I was told it was a brand new plane. I had no rest and was tired and sleepy when I arrived in Seoul, yet I still had to conduct my meetings. My flight was worse than an economy ticket. One of the flight attendants offered me miles and I told them I want the money back because it was not a business class experience at all. I had originally paid $703 to upgrade to Premium select until I my first flight so I upgraded to Delta One for $1,532, which I paid over $2,000 for a first class 14 hour flight and received a less than comparable economy flight. After my flight I requested to be refunded for my upgrade through customer service online.  I was told they would refund my ticket upgrade yet the amount they quoted me of $724 was not what I paid for my upgrade. I told them that was not my upgrade amount. Then they wrote me back and said that was half of the amount for the upgrade, which apparently they cannot do simply division either. I received a second email saying I would not be satisfied and that they would no longer correspond on the matter. This is the way Delta dismisses customers. It didn’t matter that I was a first class customer or that I had Silver Medallion status, I was just another customer that suckered into their flight. Worst of all I had given them praise coming in, but they they didn’t care about having a new loyal customer and showed me the true way they treat customers. I fly first always, so I know what a first class experience should be - in country I had a short flight from Denver to Las Vegas on Frontier and that experience was 1,000 times better than my 14 hour Delta One experience. I would never fly nor recommend this airline. It is just like all the other American airlines - poor customer service, filled with arrogant employees.The airline clearly stated they would refund my upgrade amount, yet when I told them of the amount error they had too much pride to correct it and dismissed all because they could. This airline should never receive any awards with the way they treat their customers and with their raggedy planes. This was my first trip with Delta and my last."
Date of travel: July 2019,40,Delta 757 SAN-JFK-SAN,"I have to say that i’m impressed of how Delta is keeping their 757’s in such a good shape and retrofitted like if they were fresh out of the fabric, even with the Boeing Sky Interior, and a great inflight entertainment on every seatback with a good selection of movies, series, games and a real-time map showing the route and weather conditions in the destination. I had a great experience with Delta overall, great on-time performance on my roundtrip flight from San Diego to New York-JFK, the cabin crew were efficient but, in my opinion, not very friendly at all on the outbound flight; and all in all if that sounds good enough, I was happily surprised with the free meals service on economy in transcon flights within the US, i chose the Veggie wrap and it tasted great and flavorful. I would definitely choose Delta again."
Date of travel: January 2020,20,Paying the price for app glitch,"I travel a lot for my new work position and since Delta is the only airline that flies in and out of my local airport, I figured I'd give them a shot rather than taking the hour drive I've been doing to other airports. My flight to Vegas was great, after the app gave me the option to upgrade to Comfort+ seats on the way there. These seats were so wonderful and the flight attendants were great that I decided to try and book them for the flight back a few days in advance to make sure I'd get them again.I logged onto the app about 12:30am and saw multiple seats available but when I tried to purchase I received an error message that said to try again later. I tried again soon after and received the same error message. I decided I would try again the next day. However, when I logged on the app, it only offered first class upgrades at 3x the price so I figured I'd check my CC account to see if comfort+ went through. There were two pending charges on my account so I called Delta to find out what's going on.After almost an hour delay for response, they tell me they don't see those seats available on their end and that it is just a double charged hold on my account since I tried to book seats that ""were not actually available"" They said others must have booked them all (about 10) during the night after I tried and before I tried today. After much discussion back and forth I asked if I could get the first class seats for that price, due to their app causing this issue. The supervisor said they would not take less than full price for first class. Now, I get the airline wanting as much money as possible, but I spent a decade in customer service and building that loyalty for long term use should come first. If they came back with even half price for first class, which would still be more than what my pending charges are for comfort+, I would have been willing to negotiate since I get it is another step up from what I was /am? Paying for. But no, straight up full price only and sucks to be you is how they handled it.The most they could do is put a note on my name saying I am interested in Comfort + seats and (supposedly) when I get to the airport, if two seats become available, I can purchase them at full price there.I will be checking my CC account again tomorrow to be sure that those double charges for seats that were not actually available to purchase come off my account. If not, I guess they will get another call from me. It's sad that after a great trip there, I'm left with a sour taste for this airline on the return. Lesson learned."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,"Airport was awful, but the flight was great.","Took over an hour to wait in line to drop by checked bag.  No one was helping manage the line, as tone point it intersected another line. Then another hour for TSA check.  It took over 2 hours to get to the gate, I know for a fact that one family missed their flight.  If traveling out of MSP need more than 2 hours."
Date of travel: January 2020,30,Top Single-Use Plastic Airline,"Delta Air Lines performs in my opinion slightly below average in most aspects. I feel it lacks a common framework, some kind of unified criteria, when it comes to passenger service. It is such a big airline that it really depends on whoever is working at the terminal or on board that day to provide passengers with professional assistance. I have seen quite a few unfriendly boarding moments at Delta, sometimes the welcome coctail arrives, sometimes it is only a word on the menu. But there is one thing Delta does everytime they fly: to generate tons of single-use plastic and paper waste when they could go much more sustainable. Safety can no longer be the excuse. It is time to change. If flight attendants stopped giving out two paper towels by mistake instead of one, or none, every time they serve you a drink, guess how much paper they'd save. Do you really really need to wrap the bread buns and the pillows and blankets in disgusting plastic? Keep calculating... Refleshing paper-towels? Could we find a less-disposable passtime? Do you reuse the plastic plates where food is served? Did you know that most passengers would be more than happy to keep that plastic glass they are offered for the entire flight instead of disposing and replacing them every time they drink? Be a pioneer company and set the example, Delta."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Smooth Journey,"We had a really good crew on our flight and that makes a trip seem easier.  The website had said no food service so we went prepared with snacks but Delta served a full meal, had snacks always available and then served another light meal before landing.  The inflight entertainment was good and WiFi was available.  All in all, it was a pleasant flight."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great service,My husband and I were traveling back from celebrating our 30 wedding anniversary and the flight attendant was so kind that she gave us champagne.  We felt so special tho it would have been even greater if we were bumped to first class but it was a full flight. We still felt honored and will continue flying Delta to all our destinations.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Not Quite First Class,"We flew on Delta’s fairly new premium service, Delta One, round trip from NYC to Madrid.  The food was good, given it was airline food, which means vegetables were over cooked while the meat or seafood entrée was very hot in place and room temperature in other places.  What Delta is touting is their new lay flat sleeping pods.  Essentially the seat moves forward making space for the seat back to recline, no more does the seat in front of you recline in such a way that you cannot leave your seat to go to the bathroom.  As the seat moves forward your feet and then your legs move into a coffin-like arrangement in front of you and to the side of the person in front of you.  I am well over six feet tall, have large feet, and sleep on my side.  Try as I might I could not get my feet into the snug space provided while turning onto my side; I succeeded once only to have a bustling flight attendant whack my protruding right knee.  So the good news everyone in the Delta One cabin can lie flat, the bad news is that given your height and your sleep preferences not everyone will be able to sleep, Delta went for flatness over comfort.  I suspect we will sample other premium services for overnight and fly Delta during the daylight hours."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,professionalism at its best,"new, clean plane. Hospitable steward, stewardesses.. Special need ( wheelchair) no wait time.  Just hassle free."
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Decent Short Flight,Decent short haul flight. The plane was clean and arrived on schedule. There was one flight attendant that was a bit high strung but as I say any flight that lands is a good flight.
Date of travel: December 2019,30,pay,Make sure that you pay all the extras in front to get your seats together. Very disappointed that paid for seats months in advance just find they were not together.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,The only way to go,"On a 9 hour flight, business class is a must. Seats were amazingly comfortable and the service impeccable."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Flight was delayed- but for mechanical issues- great flight and people,We had to switch planes but they did it and got us on a replacement within an hour and half.  Delta has very friendly people and the planes are comfortable.  You pay a little more but you get more for it.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Great Flight,"great service, great crew, always love flying delta, staff is always making sure you have what you need"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Another flight,Another flightOn Delta makes my 62 flight of the year I am a diamond level flyer so on a majority of flights I do get moved first class this particular flight I was in economy plus which is not a bad seat a little tight. Being a dime and I have the ability to get on at the beginning of boarding so space for my carry-on is never a problem what is the problem is everybody else bringing all her bags furniture dog pets and food like a refugee flight I was probably bank about 15 times with a carry-on or backpack the airlines have created this problem by charging outrageous prices for checked luggage basically to increase their profits. The flight attendants are generally pretty good sometimes they can be a little Kurt And not as friendly as you might expect. Delta is pretty much the only thing out of Detroit so someone if you’ve travel for business you’re forced into it not as much of a free choice as you might think but such is life in the big city
Date of travel: December 2019,50,great service clean plane easy travel,service in the detroit delta terminal 5stars...friendly helpful and enjoyable...flight was also perfect and the airline provided quality snacks and drinks which for a 2 hour flight was not expected but very nice. arrival and departure from Savannah hilton head was also friendly and enjoyable also 5 stars...and return to dtw was just as nice...kudos to Delta.
n/a,50,Handled Flight Delay Perfectly!!,"I've only flown Delta in the States a number of times and thought of them as an average American airline carrier. This was the first time I've flown with them internationally and I am VERY impressed with how they've dealt with conflict. First off our flight was delayed because a passenger acted out towards a flight attendant and had to be removed on captains orders. I appreciate a strict captain who was trying to maintain everyone's safety for the nine hour flight. After that we took off and within 20 minutes the captain informed us of a problem with landing gear, he was incredibly detailed, and thorough. As soon as we deplaned there was food for us, accommodation organized with dinner and breakfast, and our flight was already scheduled for the next day. Their flight attendants, captains, and Narita staff all worked together perfectly and we will definitely recommend this airline!"
Date of travel: August 2019,10,Avoid like Bubonic plague,"In flight experience on gua-lax was shockingly pathetic; asian veg meal consisted of a 4' bagel bread with fruit custard kinda filling and a separate portion of dark grapes for main course. Don't know if this is the norm. They offered coffee/drinks numerous times which was welcoming. While waiting to use the washroom I sat momentarily on a seat and a colored hostess with curly dark hair walked over and bellowed "" you can't sit here! Up! Up! Up, RIGHT NOW! "" I immediately got up but I was not as fast as an able bodied person and while I was getting up at this lady said "" There is a $10k fine for doing what you just did , HURRY UP RIGHT NOW or I will be much more curt about it"" All the while using her hand in a rude 'get up' motion. Those were her exact words verbatim. It's deplorable that Delta treat guests like that. I felt shamed and threatened (while I willingly complied with instructions) in full view of the a planeload of watching passengers. Another hostess with pixiblonde hair indiscreetly chewed gum throughout the flight in the most I don't give a **** manner right in passengers' faces.Upgrading a basic economy ticket is not possible, even if you offer to pay ANY amount of difference in fare. Only option is to lose your money through a cancellation and book a fresh ticket. There is zero free check in luggage allowance in that sector.Next time, I stick with Avianca."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,New A220,"I really enjoyed the new A220, clean more room and a lot bigger than the old RJ. Quieter just a real nice airplane. Thank Delta"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,great  service and good with children,flying with toddler can be daunting. They took care  of our checkin bags. The boarding was great. We infact left  20  min earlier and reached earlier . Checked  in bag was  trhere by the time we reached baggage claim.  Flight crew were friendly
Date of travel: December 2019,20,No compensation for BAGGAGE AND 9H FLIGHT delay!,"Flight 26th Dec, Seattle - PHX My bags got delayed and flight got delayed for 9h from the time I booked my tickets. Delta transferred me to an Alaska Airlines flight departing the same time but forgot to transfer my bags with my ticket. Delta refused to compensate anything for the inconvenience and TWO DELAYS. The baggage delay staff, Vicki Hayes shifted the blame on Alaska Airlines twice, claiming I've made claims with them (WHICH I HAVEN'T AT ALL)Just a clear shift of blame and lack of integrity to own up to their company's mistakes. Will never fly with such a shady airline again. Poorly played, Delta."
Date of travel: November 2019,30,"You have to fly, if you want to get there. No choice.","This was a non stop flight from Detroit to Cancun, so it was only a little over 3 hours.  The flight was comfortable, and I saw a good movie.  Of course, three people in a row makes for cramped quarters.  It was uneventful for that short amount of time. I fly Delta almost exclusively."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Comfortable Flight,"Friendly crew, in-flight entertainment is very good, you will be offered free earplugs and travel package, the legroom is a bit tight during a long flight, we were in the back of the plane and the menu did not provide everything for us, the blanket and pillow takes up a lot of space. But still very satisfied of Delta Airlines."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Flying to maui,"Delta, Delta, Delta. I love you so much but what I don’t like is the seat with little padding or cushion especially on flights of 4 or more hours. My seat was less padded than a metro bus seat. I know you have planes with great seating. So either have the flight coordinators sit in those seats for 5 hours and then we will see if they don’t get phased out. Otherwise it’s great flying with you. But those seats just suck."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Do not fly first class,"I originally wrote a terrible review, however Delta have contacted me and have sorted the situation quickly - whereby my luggage was destroyed in transit.I do stand by what I said previously about domestic first class however - you will have no access to a lounge so you still might as well sit at Dunkin Donuts, the seats are tiny, dirty and worn, and I would really advise against it. I am curious to know about long haul first class - we shall see."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Awesome flight.,"The plane was new and while we were sitting on the runway a cool mist was wafting instead of the normal hot jet fuel smell.  I had two teenage boys and they loved the flight.  There were televisions on the seat backs and free recent movies.  We have been really loving Delta lately. They also really tried to let us on the plane with our carry on luggage which is really important to us.  The bins were actually made to fit the luggage.  Imagine that. No comments like from Swiss Air:   ""Your carry on bag is too heavy."".  What??? they are all going on the same airplane."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Comfortable journey,"Comfortable seating for short flights in economy, friendly crew, good entertainment options. The flights left on time and reached earlier than the advertised ETA on the return leg."
Date of travel: January 2020,20,Lack of leadership and standard process,"Delta tries very hard to introduce new products (new planes, seat, WiFi, best sky miles program). Improvement items: (1) The blanket is very thin (DELTA one) no enough for low temperature. (2) Delta one meal is not so good. (3) deplane process: flight attendants does not make sure that Delta one customers leave the plane first. it ends up Delta one and premium customers are competing leaving the plane. (4) Monitor shows DL026 is carousel 2. I am waiting for 1 hour and someone told I could find my bag on carousel 4. It is terrible because no delta people informs Delta one customers the bags are on carousels 2 & 4. Most Delta One customer were waiting for 1 hour. Delta must have a standard procedure. Filed team associate needs to have leadership to deal with situation.(5) ATL airport is the worst airport: broken toilets, Global entry monitors."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Great customer service,"I forgot my laptop on the plane and the sweetest, most motherly gals names Rosalind and Joy helped me from Deltas baggage service. Joy ran all the way back to the plane to get it for me. First trip to Hawaii started off a little scary, but they fixed it right away!!"
Date of travel: January 2020,10,One lazy and  careless flight attendant ,"Fortunately I have previously experienced Delta Airline cabin crew members being hard working and caring professionals-and then there is Dwayne ... I wonder how he gets away with his unprofessional, lazy,  careless and extremely  “laid-back“ work attitude . On our Delta 737-900 flight No. DL536 from Cancun to Altanta on 01 January, he stayed seated for the longest time before coming round just once on the 2:15 hours flight (!!) offering drinks. I got one soda on the whole flight... in first class !! I needed water and had to get it from the cabin myself, maybe he forgot....however he was not accommodating at all. I felt like being a disturbing factor in his “cool”Awful, rude  and unprofessional behaviour of a Delta cabin crew member! We pay too much money to put up with such bad behaviour..."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Christ*mas getaway,We booked through orbitz for a delta flight. I didnt realize that orbitz gave me 2 different confirmation#'s. So when I try to use the kiosk to print my boarding pass it couldnt find my husband. Delta quickly got it all straightened out. Once we got to the gate. The attendants were great. It was a full flight and somehow my husband was on standby. They asked the passengers if they wanted to give up their seat. One did and he was rewarded for his kindness. We were able to get on. The flight had turbulence but the pilots and crew made our safety a priority. Love flying delta.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Better flight crew,"The flight was almost empty, and when the boarding ended, on flight came to us and offered us to move to the front of the plane since we were at the front exit row and our seat did not recline, he also offered to the people on the other exit rows, very proactive!"
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Useless flight attendants,"It was a full flight, they even offer great money to stay for a later flight, service on-ground was good and they kept us informed at all times. After we boarded (MAIN 2) most of the overhead compartment were full, but almost half was with small items that should be below the seats. On top on my seat there was an mid-size purse, and the owner said that she did not have to move it because it was the only item she had (she does not know that is by size and not quantity); when the flight attendant saw this, instead of come and help resolve the issue, like explaining that small items go below the seat in front of you, act as he did not see or hear anything and turn around and went to the back of the plane. Passengers voluntary check their carry-on bags and still when the final groups boarded the plane there was not space for them to put their bags and have to return them to the front to check them. One attendant could have prevented this situation really easily, and speed the boarding process but the just stayed idle"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Atlanta to Aruba,We were lucky to get the exit row seats (a little more leg room) and no third person in our row added more room. the flight was not very long anyway. Service was good and the flight was smooth.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,New elevated experience,"The new elevated experience from Delta put them back at the same service peaks of non-USA airlines. Most American airlines do not offer any perks on-flight on international flights, and all do not offer anything on domestic flights. Now Delta is back at the game on certain international flights only. The food was amazing, unlimited snacks, welcome cocktail, and seat very comfortable. The only not so great part is the flight attendants, they are not bad, but simply as any american flight attendant or waitress in USA, they do the very minimum to complete the given job, I think that is the only remaining improvement that Delta needs to do in international flights, and hopefully some day on Domestic as well. The on-board entertainment was superb"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Mid Week Travel,"This flight surprised me.  Had the best experience with Delta on this trip.  Got to the gate and asked the agent if I could pre-board due to my leg injury and she said yes.  She even did one better and changed me to a row with only me since she said it was a full flight.  Totally caught me off guard because sometimes the gate agents are not that pleasant. only bad part about this trip, there was no entertainment on the phone.  I wanted to look at a movie or something. I may need to start flying through the middle of the week if I am going to get service like this."
Date of travel: November 2019,20,Forget First Class,"No where near what I expected for the money.  Had only one selection for the breakfast meal (it was terrible).  Holes for your feet are too small if you wear a size 11 shoe or larger, so was not able to get decent sleep.  Business class on Emirates way better than First Class on Delta.  This service not worth the money.  I like Delta for domestic flights, but won't do an international flight with them again if I can help it."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Great route with top airlines,Easy flight with great crew. I find this flight enjoyable. Just long enough to catch a movie or enjoy a couple of papers.
Date of travel: December 2019,20,Horrible Customer Service ,"Arrived at ATL with my child, who was flying by himself to San Antonio. The Delta representative at the front of the line was using profanity and was extremely rude to multiple customers. The front desk was also rude and very short with myself and my child. Very disappointed with the Atlanta Delta staff. I will not fly with them again."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Delta Does it Better,"The flight over to London from ATL, was pretty uneventful.  The service was pretty standard, and they were very good with the customers.  The nite flights are usually pretty quiet and this one was no exception.  They have revamped their ticket process so a basic ticket you cant make any changes to.  The process is more self help and not really really what Delta Customer Service does.  You have to do everything yourself."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great Flight Crew under difficult circumstances,Our flight was delayed due to a mechanical issue. Parts had to be brought in and plane repaired. The flight crew and pilot was awesome with communication and keeping everyone up to date. Delta was generous with helping out as our work schedules had to be changed.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Easypeezylemonsqueezy!  Delta rocks!,"The staff is exceptional!  Seats were great, check in was a breeze, make sure your carry on liquids are within the rules!  And even tho I requested a window seat my final flight was windowless but leg room was great!  Also make sure your seat allows under the seat storage...ours did not...not big issue but surprised."
Date of travel: January 2020,50,Delta Airlines,Very pleasant experience. Always from with Delta. Very nice staff . I highly recommend it to everyone.
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Bad business practices,"On my flights to Phuket, I upgraded from economy to economy plus (~ $400 for the 1 13 hour flight), but wasn't sure if it was going to be worth it so I waited ti upgrade the return long leg. When I went to upgrade it on the day of the flight there were about 8 open seats, but they were $900. I spoke to the gate agent repeatedly and she quoted me $1200 and $3000 to first class (which didnt surprise me because it was a $2500 upgrade when we booked the flights months earlier). Regardless, its a poor business practice to prefer your upgraded seats left empty by making the price for them astronomically high. I tweeted the same information to delta and have never heard anything. If I can help it, I'll never flight delta again. Outside of the upgrade situation, the flight attendants were kind, the economy seat and space was standard (uncomfortable when you're on flights for 24 hours), and on the long flight, the aircraft thought we were flight Africa to Newark so we never knew where we were in our flight path. Another reason I wont fly them again. Also, on our flight from Seoul to Phuket we flew ""Korean Air"".  If you can help it, don't fly Korean Air.  They were worse about they're upgrades (I was quoted $6000 to first class, but saw a korean family of 3 including a baby leave from first class - no way they paid $6000 each by what they were wearing). The plane was unbelievably hot, the seats were smaller than most NA flights, the flight attendants spoke broken english, and there was no alcohol provided on the flight. This all made for a very unenjoyable 7 hour flight."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,A good flight experience this time around,"While I have had issues with Delta in the past regarding seat selection, this time our round trip went very well. Unlike in previous instances, this time we received seat assignments for both flights at the time of booking. This was great because we went on a cruise and would not have had reliable WiFi to check in online before the flight home. The check-in process at both airports was smooth and easy. The flights boarded on time and took off within 30 minutes of the time stated on our tickets. All Delta staff both on the ground and in the air were friendly and helpful."
Date of travel: January 2020,10,do NOT use the app for boarding passes,App fails to load passes 10-15 minutes before boarding ends. I was at a small airport where after TSA scans your pass it's 3-5 minutes to go through the security screening and then 1-2 minutes to get to your gate. Cutting it close but the TSA line was longer then I've ever seen it in 15 years of flying this airport. App had the pass pulled up but then said that I could not show passes as it was too close to the flight leaving. This 'feature' cost me $250 to get a new flight. This must be an intentional measure to squeeze a few more dollars out of travellers.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Caring flight crew,Our flight to Munich was long and uneventful which is a good thing. One of the passengers was not feeling well and had gotten sick right before we pushed back. I was impressed by the caring nature of the stewardess who made it a point to check on the passenger frequently.  Kudos to the flight crew.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Non Stop Flight,Had round trip non stop flights.  Flights were timely and had good service.  Had movies and snacks.  Drinks were extra.  Prices were higher thank Sun Country but flights were at better times and more reliable service.  Would choose to use again
Date of travel: December 2019,20,"Long flight, disappointed service.",Disappointed with the lack of service on our flight back from Honolulu. We were offered just refreshments and snacks and the most uncomfortable seats ever.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Impressed with Delta staff all around,I have been noticing  Delta airline personnel from the moment you check in to the flight crew and employees at the baggage check and transfer counters are happy to work for Delta airlines and do their best to make you happy.This includes when I fly coach an other great feature is when you check bags you will get text update notifications when your bag is loaded onto the plane.
Date of travel: January 2020,10,DELTA NOW OVERBOOKS OR OVERSELLS EVERY FLIGHT--do not leave for the airport until you check!!!,"Each flight was either over-booked or over-sold. (we had a total of 3 and 3 people in our party) We struggled with EACH AND EVERY FLIGHT. We booked months ago. So if you plan ahead, you are the first one to get BUMPED!!! So we missed my only nephew's wedding and had to rebook (and they did not refund our messed up flights even after booting us and it was THEIR FAULT!!) Just don't use this airline unless you go to the counter at EACH GATE to ENSURE you have a seat. We also had run 45 min each way to the airport two days in a row (within 24 hours) because of their ineptitude. And rudeness. When my daughter went to ask the counter about her seat, they man yelled at her and said, ""oh you are good"" without hardly a look at the ticket. She started tearing up at his rudeness (they sent her all alone, separated without her parents on a 5 hour flight) he yelled at her AGAIN and AGAIN. (she cried in embarrassment) I am calling for his JOB! It was at the Atlanta airport, Jan 1st, and the flight left at 10:04 so you can figure out who was manning the counter at the time. It was a a man in his 30's/40's, tall, and overweight. APPALLED all around. Flight attendants barked at us on the flight, ignored us and yelled at passengers. I can't believe this airline will stay in business."
Date of travel: December 2019,30,BETTER RENAME IT TO SPIRIT,"I swear paying $500 for domestic flight and getting treated like you are taking $25 flight in spirit airline. planes are oversold 9 out of 10 times , late, always rescheduling and making spend more money , i hate traveling lately with Delta not worth the money at all"
Date of travel: December 2019,10,So Disappointed,"We have flown Delta in the past with no problems, but this past Monday, January 30, 2019, was a major exception.  We had a connecting flight from Atlanta, Georgia to Columbia, South Carolina.  Immediately upon boarding the plane, we were hit with oven temperatures.  When the aisle was clear, I approached a Flight Attendant and asked if we were going to get relief.  She said there was a problem with the air system and it would not cool down until door closed and engine started.  Pilot confirmed this a bit later to all passengers.  Passengers were visibly uncomfortable, fanning themselves and sweating.  My overhead airflow device was not working either.  I actually became very agitated and panicky.   My question for Delta is:  Why were we on a plane that needed maintenance and subjected to unbearable temperatures?  It was really difficult to breath.  If anyone else has experienced intolerable temperatures, please be sure to contact the airline and Department of Transportation.  There really should be a regulation in place that forces airlines to connect to an air system while on the tarmac."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,friendlyeeeee and helpful,needed a bit of help at the check in kiosk and the staff was helpful and got us taken care of and on our way.  flight attendants were friendly . no issues
Date of travel: April 2019,40,DL for life,"Been flying DL for almost 30 yrs. I’m sure AA and UA frequent flyers feel the same way about those airlines, but I’ve never had a truly BAD experience at the hands of the airline and am treated very well as a Sky Miles member. My allegiance lies with Delta and barring any catastrophic occurrence it will remain as is for life."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Amazing crew! They really took care of me.,"Flew Delta from JFK to Dublin, and was unfortunate enough to get very sick on an international flight. Was feeling like I would pass out and had difficulty moving and breathing. Very scary and wasn't sure if I was experiencing a stroke, heart attack or something. Flight attendants were quick in calling for a doctor on flight, moving me to a back row to lie down, receive oxygen and care until we arrived in Dublin. Had an ambulance ready at the airport to check me out or take me to the hospital, if needed. Flight attendants were attentive to me and my daughter while still taking care of the other passengers. I felt so embarrassed and scared, yet they were kind and caring. By the time we landed, I was feeling some better, able to stand up and walk to the ambulance. Thankfully, everything turned out OK and was able to continue with my trip after a day of rest. Thank you Delta for taking good care of me and my daughter during this scare!"
Date of travel: October 2019,10,Will never fly Delta again.,We booked the flight in January and booked Delta Comfort.  We chose a window seat and the seat next to the window.  A week before the flight we were changed to the center 2 seats of the 4 seat center section.No one could explain why.  No one could change our seats back although everyone could see what we had originally booked.Will never fly Delta again.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Long flight went quickly,"Great flight went well, crew were polite and friendly. On flight food was ok. In all looked after well and time flew by. Flight was on time."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Smooth Sailing,This flight was the smoothest flight I have been on.  The plane was small so not a lot of space for comfort but I would fly this route again.
Date of travel: March 2019,10,Rude staff,"Worst airline: expensive, rude staff, not worth the extra. bad experience when traveling with a 6 years old."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Comfortable,We were able to get out of PDX a few minutes early so that we arrived at NRT a little early also.  The crew was very pleasant and helpful throughout the flight
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Bumpy but nice,This was a full flight.  We had turbulence most of the way and the crew needed to be seated also.  But when they were able to they were busy serving beverages and snacks.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great,"This was a wonderful flight with great service.  It is a rather long flight but the crew was great and very cheery,"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Impressed,"Had never flown with this airline previously and was worried about the experience, I should not have been they where just great"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Fly Delta to Las Vegas!!!!,"Delta was a delight--the new airport at JFK is a bit too big for me, and there is lots of walking to do, but the airport itself is lovely--lots of shops and food establishments---the airline was great---lots of seat room and very good airline crew---travel isn't as nice as it used to be, but Delta makes it almost bearable and safe."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,"Nice plane, good service","The new Delta planes are very nice. Comfortable seats, large tv screens, and an excellent movie selection. I flew with a walking boot and crutches and the staff was very accommodating."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,"Efficient, Great Pilots, On Time, still uncomfortable seating","After an October trip involving two American Airlines flights--Birmingham to Charleston and Charleston to Little Rock--this was pure luxury.  No coach class airline is fun to fly these days, but the Delta flights were way better than the American flights, for two reasons.  With American there were incredible delays for which no explanation was given and which caused missed connecting flights:  two different flights on two different days and it happened every time.  The staff seemed overworked, harried, and tired, and the pilots were not communicative and didn't exude confidence or good cheer.  On the contrary, the Delta flights were on time or even early, flight staff members were pleasant and efficient and had their act together, and the pilots actually came out where they could be seen once before the flight, and reported regularly on our progress during each leg.  If there was even the tiniest turbulance, the Delta pilots came on the audio system to reassure passengers.  Luggage was not a problem with either airline."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,1st class includes 2 no fee checked bags.,"no disappointments. very nice service in first class. price difference is defensible considering 2 no charge checked bags, much better seats, and always attentive service."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Extremely pleasant experience with Delta,"My family group of 7 ( including two kids and five adults ) traveled from NY to San Diego on Christmas Day morning . It was a 6 plus hour flight . I have not traveled Delta in almost 10 years and I travel multiple times a year. I must say it was one of the best flying experience we all had. Leg room was great, comfy seats . Tv programming enriching with various options. Flight attendants were exceptional and attentive  . We even had actual meals . Typically we get snacks in our other flights . But here we were served real lunch and they stopped by very often offering additional drinks ( coffees , juice , water, snacks, etc) . The entire flight experience was awesome . I must say Delta pumped up their game big times . I am tremendously impressed . Looking forward to booking some of our future trips with delta after this experience . You guys rock !"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Timely return trip,"Boarding was efficient though tedious checking and re-checking thru security. We left on time and arrived 40 minutes earlier (that time was primarily taken up by the long lines at customs arrival) and despite that long process, all the luggage was on the floor and off the carousel making that process quick.  The seats were not as comfortable as in economy plus and the space between rows was a few inches less but bearable.  The restrooms are abysmal and just not kept clean. For most of the trip the flight attendants were nowhere to be found (you saw them the first hour or so and then the last hour)."
Date of travel: August 2019,30,"Our luggage, which was clearly marked, never left Minneapolis on our flight change to Copenhagen.","Once in Copenhagen, they were not friendly at all. Luckily, we had arrived there 2 days prior to our cruise.One suitcase came one day and then the other came separately.We were not allowed to access our luggage until 8:30pm after we took a taxi back to the airport at 7pm. Then at 8:30, they handed us our luggage.There was no compensation, just a generic apology email sent to me."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Delta delivered as promised.,Delta airlines has always came through for me. They deliver what they promise. On time departures and arrivals. No lost luggage and the plane was flown safely by the pilots. The flight attendants were friendly and helpful. The food was good. Great flight and trip.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,wonderful,"The in flight entertainment system is wonderful, especially for small children. The airbus plane was great. Delta has now become my preferred airline!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Fantastic,Everything was on time and the flight crew did a super job! it would have been nice to get a little more than a snack.
n/a,50,Very nice,"It's been a while since I used Delta and I have to say It was a very good welcome back experience. As I said In my other reviews. I flew 3 different airlines in different categories in a week and this crew was super sweet and attentive. Even though this was the cheapest, back of the plane, last boarding flight. Shout out to the Captain and crew on flight 1455  to LGA on 12/17.We had some rough weather patches and the Captain always made announcements and let us know what was going on."
Date of travel: December 2019,20,Mechanical Issue caused +6 hour flight delay,Delta flight from Omaha to Salt Lake City was delayed about 3.5 hours due to an incoming airplane mechanical issue. Seems like they knew of it the evening before when the plane came in at the end of the day. Gate attendant said you can't expect them to have other planes available to sub in if you're not flying out of a hub. The delay compounded with a +3 hour layover in SLC before I could get on the plane to Twin Falls. Essentially 6.5 hours later than I had planned. The only compensation was a sandwich and a soda at the gate in Omaha.
Date of travel: December 2019,30,First Class is not what it used to be,"As flights go it was 5/10. I was traveling with my son. The plane was pretty old. The tech was old. My seat was not really roomy by any means. The staff was ok , but their attitude was not one of “thanks for buying a 1st class ticket and getting a crappy seat and not complaining about it”. It was more like they were doing us a favor by getting us a drink? Even that is not such a big deal, but 1st class is not really 1st class any longer. Worst part of the flight was the dog allowed to fly kept pooping. The smell was horrible. Sure the owner cleaned it up, but ugh. We need to start having a kennel section in the airplane. Its not like our dogs are frequent flyers. They get freaked out and have tummy troubles - like the rest of us. That being said it is something that is not a my problem, but an airliner problem. Not sure how to correct this but 1st class should mean first class. A little pampering in the sky. Photos are examples of beat up over head bins doors and a picture of the trim sagging in the bulkhead. Our plane was in need of some tlc."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Great flight,"Before the flight at the gate, the pilot was out talking to everyone that was on the flight.  He came over and talked to my daughter.  The flight itself was nice, no problems.  When we were exiting the plane the pilot was next to the door and asked my daughter if she wanted to sit in the pilots seat.  Of course she said yes and went into the cockpit.  It is something that she will never forget."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Comfortable and worth the upgrade,The extra space and comfort of the seats made the trip more enjoyable. There was almost a 3 hour departure delay and not well explained why the delay - possibly a group that was going to transfer to our flight. Otherwise recommend as staff was pleasant.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Service on board. ,"The service on board was good. The coordination between flight deck and cabin should be better. Arrival was 20 minutes ahead of schedule and the cabin crew wasn’t informed correctly, it seems. There was hardly enough time for the last service and pax were urged to finish this last meal ASAP."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Flight to paradise,"Flight left on time, we didn't crash, arrived where we were going.  Watched a good movie, had a Jack and Coke."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great service,"Excellent service on this long flight. Staff very helpful and eager to please. Very comfortable with every additional comfort available. Free meals, drinks, blankets inflight entertainment, snacks, alcohol. What more could you need?"
Date of travel: September 2019,30,Torture seating,Economy seating has gotten so tight it’s torture on a long flight. To top it off after I paid for my tickets they reduced the price by almost $300 per seat and would not refund me. They wouldn’t let me cancel and rebook without a fee equivalent to the savings. No more Delta for me!
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Nice plane with wifi and in seat video,Not all long flights have in seat entertainment.  You will have to buy headphones for $2 unless you bring your own with the right jack.  The free wifi was a real bonus.  It was text only - no images - but still very nice to be able to text in flight!
Date of travel: October 2019,50,"Due to political unrest, all fights were cancelled,","When the airport opened, Delta put a 767 on the ATL=OIO flight instead of the 757 scheduled, All waiting passengers got aboard, other airlines did not respond with a larger plane, and people had to wait a day (or more) later to leave."
Date of travel: December 2019,20,Why does a million miles take two years but three trips to kill,"I’m normally a first class traveler but recently my wife and I traveled to Phoenix on delta ( anything but) comfort I would never waste the miles again; coach seats , no free bags and a banana 119,000 miles Having never tried it before and never again We were crammed in all of first class and comfort full the main cabin completely open; next time, I’ll buy a main cabin seat have the whole row and bring a banana from home for a couple hundred bucks and donate the miles to a active duty sailor or airmen so they get first class"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Very Good Airlines,"We flew from MIA to ATL to PDX.  Delta seems to have come a long way in quality and Customer Service.  We didn't have as long of a layover in ATL it was on 1hr and 9min.  the time flew so fast seems like we didn't have to wait long.  The flight had a lot of turbulence.  The Polite did a good job let us know that was going on.  The Flight entertain was easy to operate and had a nice variety of options.  The landing was very extremely  bumpy, but we had it home safe."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Outstanding Ground and Cabin Crew,"On the return journey from a recent family vacation, my 3 year old grandson became ill in the boarding line.  The crew at the gate immediately rushed to help my daughter with a vomiting child and got them cleaned up enough to board.  Once they were on board, the cabin crew repeatedly checked on him and brought him drinks and easy on the tummy snacks.  I cannot say enough good things about Delta and these employees!"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Flight changes by Delta,"Delta changed my flights home from 10 day Hawaiian vacation. Delta 620 on Dec 21 from Seattle to Cincinnati was horrendous. My delta comfort seat was smaller and more uncomfortable than steerage.  The stewardesses were tired and short during service. The restrooms were inadequate and far from seated passengers.  Delta switched me from flying from Honolulu to Atlanta to Ft Myers, a fairly straight flight. Instead, I flew from Honolulu to Seattle to Cinncinnatti to Ft Myers. What a third class service!!"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,"Generally stellar, at times amazingly awful","Planned a Christmas trip for the entire family. Delta delayed out of Memphis. Gate agent in Minneapolis was a horrible human being. RAN to the gate. Two members of our party were rounding the corner and he handed mine back and closed the gate door in front of me. All of this 10 minutes before departure on a flight they knew was coming. All 6 of us were rerouted, lost our luggage, and arrived a day late. The subsequent Delta flight to Amsterdam allowed two separate parties to board at 4 minutes until departure. Clearly, CJ at Delta in Minneapolis was on a power trip. Delta should have made this right. Unfortunately, all they did was make excuses. Offered a few thousand flyer miles. Normally, Delta has excellent service. We have not had one other problem. This one was a MAJOR flaw."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Wonderful Airline,We have used Delta before and never had any problems with them.  This time my husband just had open heart surgery and he needed a wheelchair to get to the gates for the transfers.  On the way down the wheelchair was ready and it was great.  On the trip home I forgot to tell them that he needed the wheelchair but they were right there waiting for him when he got off the plane.  They must have put it on the ticket from the first time.  He never would have made it to the connection without it.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great service and ontime as well!,"We had a great flight from MSP to Las Vegas on Christmas Eve. We opted for Delta Comfort as we couldn't get an upgrade to first class for this leg of our trip. The seats were great and the flight boarded, departed and arrived on time. The service provided by the flight attendents was very good."
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Delayed boarding process,The boarding process was so late and we ended up flying 20 mints late than the designated time. Only one old lady was there at the boarding counter and no other staff around. It took so long to board. The seats were so congested.
Date of travel: March 2019,40,Great airline!,"We don't travel by air much, but when we do, we use Delta. We've tried other ones, but liked Delta best. The attendants are helpful and pleasant. The movies are good and the snacks are alright. We keep coming back to them!"
Date of travel: December 2019,10,god-awful service,"Zero stars if possible. Absolutely horrible. I will never fly Delta again in my life, not unless all other possible options were exhausted. At the beginning, my passport was rejected at the self check-in counter as my reservation name did not match my passport. I was redirected to an agent. The line to the counters was ludicrously long, which speaks to the inefficiency of the process. Speaking of which, what is the point of self check-in if you have to bring your luggage to the counter anyway, thus defeating the purpose? The row had two types of counters - one for check-in and the other for “agent assistance"". Once again, perhaps I'm unenlightened, but why do you need two types of counters if the staff can perform both functions? The line crawled along like an ugly humanoid slug. 45 minutes in, I realise that I am too far away and the official check-in limit is ending in 10 minutes. I desperately ask for help from the staff, but they inform me that they won't be able to expedite me under any circumstances. Despite the fact that I am going to miss my flight. And I do. When I finally get to the counter, the staff informs me sorry but you've missed it by a few minutes so you can't get on the flight now. You can try calling this number to get a waiver because the queue was long. I call the number crying because my friends have now left for their flight and I am left alone but the service lady on the other side either does not pick up on it or does not care. She snaps at me multiple times, expresses no empathy nor sympathy for my situation, and is obviously impatient. I'm just asking for help; decency is free. My original flight is wasted. I have to pay an extra US$200 for a new flight at another airport. All this time I am trying to pull myself together crouched in a corner I keep getting shooed from my spot because apparently I am standing at an inappropriate location even though I am not blocking nor inconveniencing anybody. Later I find out that my friends missed their flight too because they waited too long for me. Guess who's sitting at the other airport now typing this. JFK Airport is implicated in this review too - I’d also give less than a star on TripAdvisor for their [lack of] assistance and overall awful experience."
n/a,40,Exceptional flight staff,"You can't go wrong flying first class with Delta. The staff onboard was top notch!I do wish they wouldn't give beverages in an open glass. It's tough to manage easily on a flight. I know glass is used because it's first class, but it's just not practical to me.Meals were just ok. Plenty of snacks available though.Love the inflight movies and phone charging station at my seat!I'd definitely fly Delta first class again!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Delta One!!!!!!!!,Delta One is the most well spend money ever. I rode in it for a transatlantic flight to Germany. I honestly was sad that the flight was over. The seats were so nice and converted to full size beds. Baggage claim was so efficient. Food was great. Much better than economy class. AMAZING!
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Better experience then last time.,We arrived at the airport At a very busy time. The holiday season had started. The check in process was smooth. The check in attendant  was pleasant and efficient. I asked her to look and see if she could change our seats. She did look but was unable to accommodate us. She recommended that we ask again at the gate. We went towards security which had about a 40 minute line. We were redirected to another security area and breeze right through. At the gate I can requested and was told the change will be unlikely. We were about an hour early so I walked around the airport for a while. I came back as the boarding process has started. As we went to board we were delighted to find that our seats had been changed. I thanked the attendant and we boarded.  I am always cold on the airplane and I dress with extra layers. I did request blanket and was told if one was available the attendant would bring it to me. Once again I was delighted that my request was granted. All of the attendant employees that we dealt with Before during and after this flight were terrific. I know that the travel season during the holidays can be stressful for both the traveler and the attendants These attendants made our trip much nicer for us. Thank you again
Date of travel: December 2019,50,"New plane, great meal, super service","Flights to dfw this time of year are almost 4 hours. Had a nice non rushed meal. Plenty of snacks and beverages for the remainder.nice, new and very comfortable Airbus A220 for the equipment."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,"Weather to blame or is it poor planning and equipment, Delta?","Flight 754 - rude flight crew, poor equipment and planning, false promotion, just lie after lie. Weather was to blame for delay,  but in reality Delta lacks integrity to be upfront and honest that the delay was due to poor equipment at the Denver airport. Hotel “discount” for stranded customers in Atlanta was an awful attempt and straight out lie to accommodate for their poor planning."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Horrible,"So this morning I tried to book tickets using 2 travel vouchers given to us due to another awful experience with Delta.  Starting at 6:30am pst, I tried to book tickets online.  The Delta website would not allow me to book, saying my card was not authorized.  I called my credit card company and they told me that Delta was not even trying to authorize the charge, so I tried again.  Same issue.  So I called customer service and sat on hold for an hour. The rep took 25 minutes to get my reservation working and quoted me the correct price that I was seeing online, then said she needed to put me on hold for 3 minutes.  10 minutes later she came back online and quoted a new price that was $50 more expensive per ticket than the previous one!!!  Of course, this is unacceptable so she transferred me to a supervisor, Al, in Atlanta, told me the same thing and that there was nothing he could do.  So even though I spent over 3 hours of my day trying to book tickets, which I couldn't book due to glitches with the Delta website and then my hour long wait on hold, I now had to pay $150 more for the 3 tickets I was trying to book!!!  This is the third experience I've had in a row that has been awful with this airline.  So sad.  I used to love flying with Delta."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Interesting Experience!,Have never flown Delta before. Found their website easy to navigate. When we arrived at the Miami airport the person behind the desk couldn't have been more helpful. However I did not realize they took cash for baggage only. Luckily I had $60 American on me. Probably mentioned on their website and I some how thought I had already paid.Thought the seating had lots of leg room. However was shocked at how small the bathroom was. I was lucky enough to fit in it but forget using toilet paper. Suggested to my husband to hold on until we made it to Atlanta when we changed planes. Still wonder how people fit in the bathroom.On entering the plane we were greeted and made to feel welcome. I mentioned we had never flown Delta and we were celebrating our Anniversary of 34 years. About 1/2 hr into flight the stewdress bought us a beverage to celebrate. Later on she gave us each a pair of Delta wings.Overall I really enjoyed flying Delta. Very professional and seating experience comfortable.
Date of travel: December 2019,30,On time but a bit of chaos at the terminal,My flight was on time and got to LAX a few minutes early.  The waiting and boarding process was chaotic with tight spaces at the end of the terminal with multiple flights boarding around the same time.  This is probably how Delta operates on a daily basis around airports but needs to figure out a better scheme for multiple flights and use of tight spaces.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,I always have a great experience with Delta.,"Delta is a top notch flight experience even for the economy flyer. Lots of leg room, free in flight movies (be sure to bring your own headphones). Plane is always clean and in my experience on time"
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Misleading,"We travelled from Salt Lake City airport on 27th of December to LH . The plane was delayed by over 4hours , I know sometimes it can’t be helped . The week previous to this we decided we would upgrade to Delta Comfort . We  had been allocated seats near the back of the plane about row 36. Went onto Delta Comfort and were asked to choose our seats ,which we did and were allocated 19H and J . What we didn’t realise was this is just economy .If I had known that it was economy , we would not have booked to pay to move up the airplane for the same economy seats . No extra legroom , no extra anything . The flight was not full so I can’t understand why you had to pay £70 extra each for nothing. The Delta Comfort website was misleading ."
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Worst trip ever,The next trip we will fly American direct out of New OrleansWhat a mess held us at Jackson because so many landing at Atlanta had to RUN  to connecting gate they had just cancelled our seats and it was 15 minutes to take offFinally get on plane and they tell us there is lighting problem get off and get another plane which took hour and half finally got to a Miami very lateReturn trip was not as bad but we lost our car keys and Delta sent us all over Atlanta airport to find list and found no one knew or cared where it was we finally gave upDelta used to ge great they aren’t now
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Good customer service,"Mean customers can take away your seat at the gate, in the waiting area. This happened to us when after two hours of waiting, we briefly got up to the service desk and when we returned an uneducated couple rushed to take our seats away from us.Anyways, the plane had two aisles and 7 seats across. First class was spectacular, with solo seats. The plane had electrical issues so they had to deplane us. Goodies were waiting for us at the gate. I got more and better goodies at the gate than on the plane. We left to Atlanta 2 hours later than the original time. For those who lost their following flights, they got connections on the next flights; sorry for them.The flight was good. They didn't have JLo's latest movie that I would have liked to watch."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Delta Never Disappoints,"For domestic travel, I'm sold on Delta. Their flights are always a pleasure. The staff is well-trained, delays are kept at a minimum and passengers are regularly updated, all-in-all, a very good experience."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Definitely recommend this one!,"Our Delta crew made our overnight flight a very pleasant experience, anticipating our  every need! The flight was on time and very smooth. Will definitely fly Delta ""across the pond"" again!"
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Comfort Plus very little,"Having flown Delta Comfort + recently round trip to and from Spain / Portugal with nice, hot meals, I was looking forward to same on Honolulu to Atlanta.The legroom in Comfort+ is good, but elbow room has not improved.  But leg room is very important on long flights (this was about 7 3/4 hours).Well, for dinner we got cold, clammy, stingy sandwiches.  I couldn't eat the soggy roll, and there wasn't much else.  Breakfast was a cold serving of misc.Even though this was technically not an international flight, you'd think they could do better for the price of this flight."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,No issues,"Flying in from Saginaw Bay City, we had a short layover before completing our travel to southwest Florida.    The seats are always a little too small, but all airlines have become more like buses.   The one criticism we have is that the boarding process has become awkward and problematic.    Years ago, all airlines had you board the rear of the plane first, now it is according to ""classes"" of travel, which means you are climbing over others to get to your seat and stow any carryone luggage.   Very inefficient."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Great flight,"Started late but got to ATL on time. Great attendants and the pilots were very friendly.Very smooth ride, despite the storms."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Delta took great care of us,The all night flight back obviously presents some issues but Delta made our flight terrific. Everything was on time and everyone from those at the airport to pilots to flight attendants were great. Would obviously take this flight again
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Home for the hols....,We were lucky to get nice-priced tickets and so we flew.  Typical delta service.  Good!  Their new menu is pretty grand.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,pleasant flight,"Nice flight except the delay in Atlanta, the notification was slow to be announced and was longer than they said it would be"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Great service,Rick Nelson - My flight from New York to Cancun with connecting flight in Atlanta.  DL 535 first class from Atlanta to Cancun - Rick really paid attention to his passenger.  He offered us more drinks after we finished our drink.  He also offered me  additional snacks when I told him that i did not want a beverage.   He kindly told me “please tell me if you change your mind”.  I would rate this flight 10 if the flight has food service.What a wonderful service.  Rick is awesome!
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Cancun and down,Flight was fine except to having to pay their stupid baggage fee for your suitcase.  Would be nice if they had better seat assignments. My wife and I had to sit in different rows.  Then they wanted $2 to rent headphones to watch their in flight movie.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Christmas day travel not bad 12/25,"My trip earlier this week on Christmas day had two legs, Flight 3887 from Peoria to ATL, and 690 from ATL to MSY.On both, the Delta folks were very friendly and accomodating, considering they had to work on Christmas.Both flights left on time and landed on or slightly ahead of time.The only down-side was in both ATL & MSY we had to wait on the plane parked on a taxi-way waiting for a gate to be avaiable, 15 to 20 minutes both times.You would think a big outfit like Delta and airports like ATL & MASY could figure out how to have a gate avaialable when planes landed so the plane could pull right up and passengers get right off.But the worst and my advice when flying out of MSY is carry your bags on, they have not yet figured out how to get all the right bags on the right plane in tim for take-off. Our flight leaving MSY on 12/21 was delayed waiting for bags, and they still didn't get everyone's checked bags on the plane before it left."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Punta Cana airport people saved my day,"The folks at the Punta Cana Delta check in hooked it up for me so much. I was running a bit late and would have missed my flight to Atlanta, where I connect to head home to Denver. I don't know what magic they worked as I don't speak Spanish, but there was a lot of talking and deliberating, all while being quite reassuring to me, and they were able to get me on the flight.Thanks to you guys, you really saved my butt!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great Experience ,Not the first time l have flown Delta Airlines but some how the experience just keeps getting better. Flew Delta 5524 on December 21st out of Montreal boarding was so easy and checking luggage was so simple. A shout out to the flight attendants for their professional and above average service provided throughout the flight. What was really good was that we had a connection from Atlanta( Even though it’s  Delta’s hub the airport was packed with Christmas travelers)to Jacksonville  it was on time and the luggage arrived promptly. Thank you Delta l have already upgraded my travel rewards with you 👍
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Delta Remains Consistent Even when Delayed,"We were on the late afternoon flight from Nashville to New Orleans through Atlanta. We were traveling with our Support Animal, a small dog, Callie. Everything went very smoothly and the whole staff are well versed in the regulations regarding support animals. Delta staff were very considerate about everything. The flight Atlanta to New Orleans was delayed and we were constanly updated when the flight arrived and was ready to board. It all went smoothly. The only complaint is that EVERY SINGLE TIME, the New Orleans staff do not read the Priority baggage tags and you always wait FOREVER for the bags to come up. The whole arrival area is a mess - a disorganized mess. They need to go to Nashville or a similar city to see how things should run. It happens every time. It is not Delta!! It is just the whole arrival situation needs some work!!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great Cleveland Delta Ground Staff,I must commend the Delta ground crew at Cleveland Airport. The check in staff is extremely friendly and have a great attitude. The gate agents for this flight worked very hard to get everyone boarded on time. I need a little extra time to board due to a medical condition. The gate staff was very accommodating and kind. The flight was flawless and the captain was at the door of the flight thanking everyone upon departing the aircraft.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,First time flying Delta and LOVED it!,"My boyfriend and I flew Delta for the first time and absolutely loved it! The staff was great, seats were comfortable, free snacks and refreshments were good, etc. I really liked how the backs of the seats in front of you had tv screens and tv and movies were free! our flight attendant gave us free earbuds to use for our tv screens as well. They also had USB ports to charge your phones."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,A new low in passenger discomfort,"If you fly coach these days, you must reconcile yourself to being treated like cattle. We flew on a B717 today. If Delta is going to exasperate us with too-narrow aisles and cramped seating, they could at least make the seats comfortable. These seats were so uncomfortable they actually became painful after about 20 minutes. We both spent most of the flight in extreme discomfort. This is inexcusable."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Nice service and chargers on the plane,The snacks provided on the plane is very nice and there are plenty of them (I am full). There is also a charger for every seat and I can use my phone to do some offline reading.
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Flight to New Orleans,Plane was to board 7:40 am. Boarded 2 times and had to deplane both times. Really no help from airlines as what to do. Had to ask other passengers and follow some to obtain a connection. Some of the personel assisted afterwards when approached them about a new connection to New Orleans. Didn't get into New Orleans until after midnight. Hotel after 1:30 am after car rental and drive to hotel. Was suppose to arrive 9:45 am New Orleans time. Very long day.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Trip to see some snow,"My wife and I took a quick trip to Tahoe before Christmas to see some snow and get in the mood for Christmas. Flew Delta due to a free companion pass I had. Although I had an issue with my sky miles account not matching my ticket, it was corrected to my satisfaction by excellent gate agents!  Other than that, flight was good and on time."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Outstanding in Every Way,"Haven't flown Delta in years, but did so on a recent flight to Georgia, and what a pleasant surprise.  Everything about the flights, both outbound and inbound, was perfect - (fairly) comfortable seats, great flight attendants, a surprising and welcomed introduction from the pilot - guess this is typical of Delta, and generous helpings of beverages and snacks.  During our visit, we purchased a new home and will be making frequent flights between Georgia and California for years to come to visit family - Delta will be our ""new"" airline and we look forward to years of travel with them."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great trip to warm weather,"Had a great flight.  regular seats are pretty tight for tall people.  Our return flight we did exit row, with extra leg room.  Love Delta overall"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Surprisingly professional service and very clean planes.,"The flight crew was very friendly and professional from the moment we boarded the plane until departing. They were very accommodating and treated us like royalty. The airplane was very clean and everything worked, unlike many other large carriers weren’t. The flight was pleasant and of the many flights we have taken, this one with Delta stood out way in front of United, which we have flown many times. Thankfully, we had a wonderful experience and WILL fly with Delta on as many future trips as possible."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Pleasant Experience,"The flight attendants were welcoming, professional and friendly and the pilot gave us plenty of warning of upcoming choppy air.  Snacks were tasty and free :)  I would fly Delta again"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Premium Select LHR to BOS,"Have flown Virgin Premium Economy several times and this is the same product,  Very much an upgrade, but some kinks to be worked out.Pros -- seats are nice, pillows are big and fluffy, entertainment screen is very large and crisp.  Has a foot rest.  Good recline   Meals were excellent food. Was on a retrofitted 767 so this section was very small, only 38 seats.  Sky Priority for check in was nice.Cons -- the ""one dedicated flight attendant"" couldn't keep up with 38 seats.  Took her an hour to serve dinner....she served one person at a time and there was a long delay halfway through, so the middle 2 seats had one person who was completely finished before the other got their meal.  Then she disappeared for 3 hours; I want back to the galley in economy to get drinks and ice cream, which they were served but we were not.   Both my screen and my seat mate's screens froze and had to be reset.  There is a bathroom right there, but first class uses it...and so does regular economy.  So not only a lot of foot traffic back and forth but one bathroom, 3 cabins using it.  Footrests don't come out very far.Overall, a nice product, again very similar to Virgin's.  Arrival in Boston was quick, it took longer for our bags to come out (within 20 min) than it did for us to clear immigration and walk to baggage claim"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Flight home from Europe,"Don't know where to start,...after flying to Europe on Air France, the return flight on Delta was a dream. My ticket said economy but I felt as if I were in ""FIRST CLASS SEATING"". Wow, the beverage service provided by the attendants was constant not to mention the snacks and meals. I kept thinking, why oh why couldn't we have flown Delta going there. Sorry Air France, no comparison.  I have been a Delta Skymiles  member for years, and for four of those I was flying somewhere each week. Having said that, this last flight in November was by far the BEST. Way to go DELTA"
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Merry Christmas from Delta Airlines!,"My day of travel back home started the day after Christmas. Leaving San Juan, Puerto Rico headed time Atlanta, Georgia for a connecting flight. My flight allotted an hour and 35 minute layover until my connecting flight home. Well, after over an hour AFTER we were scheduled to depart, we finally leave the San Juan airport heading to Atlanta. This delay now put my connecting flight in jeopardy. After speaking with the flight attendant aboard my flight, she put me somewhat at ease, telling me I have until 5 minutes before the flight leaves to get onboard. She continues to tell me that I should be able to make it, as long as I hurry to my connecting flight.Well, here we touch down in Atlanta and get off the plane. I literally run across the airport on a broken foot (for which I requested a wheelchair on every flight and never got one, thanks Delta!) to get to my connecting flight. I get to the gate at 7:36, 17 minutes before the scheduled leave time of 7:53. The board still reads “boarding” and I’m excited. Except, there is NO ONE at the desk. I wait for about 5 minutes until someone finally comes to the desk to “assist” me. The rude woman tells me I can’t board, so I try to explain the situation so she knows I’m late due to their own delays and not mine. Her reply is “It’s always our fault, never your fault, I know.” Extremely sarcastically.After I realize I am getting absolutely nowhere with this lady, I accept defeat and ask her my options. She tells me the next flight is in 3 hours. I ask her if there’s an indirect flight I can take home to get me there any earlier. I’m trying to make it home to spend Christmas with my family because I was in Puerto Rico with my wife’s family. She tells me I have to go to the help desk across the airport to find out. As I’m talking to this lady, the PILOT boards the plane. Are you kidding me!? The door isn’t even closed if the pilot just showed up! So she was completely useless, along with being rude. I accept the horrid situation Delta has put me in. What can I do? They most likely won’t refund me the money to take another airline to get home sooner, and I just have to deal with it.Finally, I express these frustrations with Delta’s “helpline” and after talking with two different people for about 20 minutes, Delta blesses me with a $75 voucher. Seriously? $75?You’ve wasted over one hour of my time waiting for the plane to take off. Now I’m sitting in the Atlanta airport for the next 2 hours, waiting for a flight I’m not supposed to even be on, and all you do is offer me a $75 voucher?This is by far the worst experience I’ve ever had with an airline. This experience has made me never want to fly Delta ever again, so you can keep your $75 voucher, I won’t ever be using it.Happy Christmas to me!"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Decent flight for the duration,"Flight was good considering the duration, good food, watched movies the entire trip, Weather was good providing a smooth flight arriving on time in Amsterdam. Going through Customs was a little crazy due to the number of people arriving at the same time."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Horrible Customer Service,"Flight Staff was very good, flight arrived on time but sat for 30 minutes while a repair was being made on another Delta Airplane waiting to leave.  I and several others were able to get to the Boarding gate before it left but was not allowed to get on.  When speaking to the the customer service Manager, the service dropped greatly. The Customer Service Manager, Wesley, told me that I bought a ""Destination and not a Time Arrival,"" and that they would get me to it eventually.  I hope that is not the new Marketing Ad for Delta."
Date of travel: December 2019,20,Held hostage with no connection or choice,We were held hostage on the plane for over a hour and a half because of weather but we were never given the choice of returning to airport and trying to make other arrangements. The airline knew before we left that more than half the people on the plane had to make connections to other flights and that we were not going to make them. So now I was in Atlanta with no help and no way of getting back to LGA because I would not make my appointment  in North Carolina in the morning.  And to top it all off they never put my checked bag on the flight that I was taking back to New York
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Started late but arrived early.,"Long planned retirement trip to New York City, which included First Class. It was to be a two hour flight but with the jet stream we go in about 20 mid early. Crew was attentive and efficient and we enjoyed the extra room. LaGuardia was good airport for midtown NYC and relatively easy to navigate."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Smooth Flying As Usual,"Took a short day trip to Seattle with the husband as a last minute adventure and couldn't have been more pleased with the service we received on Delta. Everyone was friendly and warmly greeted as we entered the plane and bid us goodbye as we left, service was prompt and helpful, and each seat had TVs which made the short trip that much more enjoyable."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Relaxing flight,"Flight was very relaxing with the exception of a little turbulence in the beginning, and a rough landing.  My family enjoyed the in-flight movies selection and complimentary earphones (be advised, do not pay $2 per set if you have a continuing flight on Delta, your connecting flight headphones will be free of charge.  We were dupped on our flight out of Baltimore)."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,From Atlanta to Paris and Back,Nice quality and cleanliness of the aircraft. Good service by attendants. No complaints.No drama is always a positive thing.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Good service,"Very impressed with service, the staff were very helpful going to Atlanta and then onto Destin - fort Walton beach and the return trip back to London !"
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Not a happy camper.,"If you have a disability, find another carrier. Delta is not the most sympathetic airline looking to accommodate passengers with disabilities or seat preferences. Their policy for seat requests is for basic economy flights will only be addressed at the gate. By that time if it is a full plane there is no choice. I could go on with more details pertaining to my issues but I have concluded that if you don't fly and pay for first class you can expect a seat where they want to put you like cattle. The Atlanta based airline seems as tho they find amusement in making any connecting flights totally on the other far side of the airport and for a person on crutches and no wheelchair assistance available on my outgoing flight, I barely caught my connection. On both legs of my outgoing flight I had the very back row of the plane, coincidence? I don't think so,who knows but I would like to know how the seating arrangement is figured out when my trip was booked and paid for in June for a December departure. Do they spin the wheel or throw a dart? Thankfully my return flight went better connection wise. Bottom line for me is to buy first class and hope for better service,try another airline or drive if time and destination allows. Good Luck"
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Not very pleased.,"I’m disabled. My severe spinal stenosis and scoliosis. I also have a condition where a bone in my tail bone keeps breaking, also I have a one year old. I NEEDED wheel chair assistant. Well, my first flight went fine. Arrived in Paris and there was no wheel chair. They kept telling me to wait so I did. Waiting and waiting chasing my walking everywhere one year where you first exist the plane. No seat, no bathroom to change her, no water to prepare milk. I kept waiting and finally the nice guy came and told me if we don’t go you’ll miss your flight I don’t know where they are. He was frustrated too. So, he grabbed my bag and I carried my 30+ lb daughter all the way across the airport. Finally to a counter where there was still no wheel chair or help. I had 30 min to reach my flight. So another worker had to carry my daughter ( I don’t want strangers carrying my little girl, but had no choice and needed help)  and I carried my stuff all the way to my flight. Finally got to gate and I kept telling him I need to clean her up. The last flight she puked all over me and her and I couldn’t get her poo cleaned off enough on the plane. So, they said hurry and I had to carry all my stuff and her to the bathroom. By the time I got back my face was red and I was in so much pain I just wanted to fall down crying. I thought once I got on plane I’d be fine. So, got on plane sit with her we get going and I’m in comfort plus. My back starts to really hurt. I can’t hardly sit on my behind. My upper back from the scoliosis started hurting so if I sat up to stretch it pushed on tailbone more. My poor daughter trying to sleep and I keep shifting around. After that long painful flight got to Atlanta and there was wheel chairs waiting so I thought ohhhh great! Thank you! Well no.. he took me as far as customs dropped me off said someone would come back and they never did. Again, 30 min before flight I had to carry my daughter get my luggage, thank you custom guy for putting my bags in cart. Then push her carry a baby to the drop off luggage area. Thankfully that woman said I could take my stroller. Bless her cause I had to run to get to the train. Long story short missed my flight. So standing waiting. Soo angry. Hurting soo bad holding my daughter. I don’t know if I should cry cuss or just die there. The girl at counter acted mad that she had to work. Said she’d get me a hotel to shuttle to. Said she’d call them to wheel chair me there. Guess what? Nope.. no wheel chair so off I go with my daughter looking for shuttle. Get outside rain and cold. My daughter didn’t have any thing but a thin cardigan because my sister was waiting to bring her coat in xna. Get outside go to shuttle get to hotel wait and wait in line. Finally get in line and we have no food. Haven’t ate since flight. My daughter was sleeping so she missed dinner. No water for her formula. Thankfully hotel girl gave me like 5 bottles. The room was paid for, so I’m grateful for at least that. Get to room no WiFi. No help to fix it went down two times carrying a baby. I finally just gave up put my baby to sleep and just dosed. I hurt so bad I couldn’t hardly sleep. I got up at 4am got her ready and back to airport to catch my flight. Stood in line asked if they could help with food and water. My debit card wasn’t with me had cash but not enough to keep buying 4 dollar water and 10 dollar sandwiches plus ran out of wipes( 16 wipes 3 dollar). So he got me wheel chair said if I needed anything to let them know. That the 15 dollar food ticket was good anywhere. It’s not. And 15 dollars isn’t crap in an airport restaurant so I had to pay out of pocket even after the 15 dollar help. Then I had one more for water.. just went to my gate and waited loaded and finally got to see my family after two years and my dad finally met his grand daughter for the first time. I missed my first day with my family. I’m only here two weeks. I’m hurting so bad still couldn’t enjoy Christmas because I’m in more pain than usual. None of my meds are helping. I feel like one eye is going to pop out. Delta has left me on a past trip in a wheel chair I fell asleep in waiting. Left me over night in the airport in the chair. No food no nothing. And to make it up just said here some sky miles you happy? Sure.. thanks. Now this.. am I happy? No.. I’d this how you treat disabled people? Because there were more. Not just me. They may not complain but I saw the poor woman standing in distress asking someone to bring her one. I heard the way they talked to the elderly who asked for one. The way you treat disabled people is disgusting. I have to use you to fly back but will I do it again? Absolutely not. I’ll look for a better way. Do I recommend delta? Only if you are not disabled would I say yeah I think you’ll be ok. Definitely no if you are disabled, find a reliable good review airline that cares for people that have disabilities. I have not contacted them yet to complain. It’s Christmas and I just wanted to wait and try to calm down from the pain and stress but I will prolly to be offered a cold water and sky miles for my pain and suffering. Never again Delta!"
n/a,50,Excellent Service ,"I guess once you experienced Delta One, no other flight services will suffice. I've been flying with them for years and I am proud to be a member. Always treated with respect and excellence.  Flying from Hawaii to Japan is one of my frequent flights to take. I am looking forward at the end of the month, so excited!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great flight in First,We were offered a preflight drink on time. The service was great through the flight. I believe Delta has the best inflight entertainment.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Wasn't bad,"The trip went great, wish I would have flown into lax. San Francisco airport and traffic surrounding was a nightmare. Anyways Delta went great as usual, great staff and nice flight. Besides legroom!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,"Amazingly great flight , when all you usually hear are complaints They","We fly several times a year mostly foreign airlines when we go international. At the end of this flight my wife and I agreed that the flight crew was the best we had seen in many years. They had to deal with 20 wheelchair customers and a full flight. Every task they had was completed quickly and with no screw ups. Very polite and welcoming. The plane was an Airbus 321 , the first we've been on. The economy seats were comfortable with more than adequate leg and hip room."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Good Trip,Booked this direct flight from BOS to FLL last minute due to a canceled flight on the previous day.  Impressed by the text communication from Delta. Arrived on time.  Leg space limited but had good entertainment system and in flight Wifi.
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Not Flying Very High,"Our flight left nearly 5 hours late (not because of weather). What bothers me the most about Delta, is that they do not communicate to their passengers clearly when things are not going well. They will state a time of departure, knowing that it is not possible to make that deadline. Because of the lateness of this flight, as you can imagine, I had many problems downline getting home."
Date of travel: June 2019,50,Comfortable Flight,"The flight was quite comfortable with nice seats and amenities. While I felt the crew were less in number, they were very helpful. The in-flight service was also regular and at no point did I feel there was anything missing. The meal (Asian Vegetarian) and beverage options were great too."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Trip to Washington,Very good flight. All stewards and stewardesses were very professional and courteous. Plenty of movies to choose from. Flight was on time and had no issues.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Comfortable flight to Cozumel,Departure & arrive was in time both way. Service was good. Try to fly with Delta all the time. Thanks Delta for good service
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great service to military!,"Thanks for great support to active duty and veterans!  I have a great travel experience with Delta airline, specially free wifi service that enables me to communicate during the in-flight and early check-in.I highly recommend this airline to all military member."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,"Extra lines, terrible with children","It seems like Delta employees are completely unequipped to handle kids on board, and they are only concerned about themselves. Multiple flight attendants act like I am making their lives difficult by needing to sit with my toddlers. I've attempted to use this airline four different times, and I've had a terrible experience every time. After we switched with two people so my husband and I could sit by our very young children, the gate agent had me standing in front of a flight full of people and scolded me for not keeping our assigned seats. She then paged someone while looking at me and saying, ""We have a problem."" No other passenger had a problem, actually. We were already in our seats.I will willingly pay more to fly on a different airline from now on. Even if the employees were kinder, I always find that there is less room on Delta flights and we always wait in lines. In fact, on our last flight, we waited in line to check our bags for an hour and a half! I have never waited in line with other airlines."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,My go to airlines....,"When I need to get somewhere on time, Delta is my go to. They have competitive prices, lots of options, free in-flight entertainment. Their crews are friendly. My kids left before we did on another airline, and go there after we did going both ways because of delays both times. They were a few dollars cheaper, but we got more island time!"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Business Channanigans,"I have been traveling with Delta for years. I trust them with my family to travel with these guys!Never disappointed by them! Most generally always on time you can count on that! Very organized on the boarding process.Friendly service, prices are reasonable and airplanes are in good shape!Like other airlines there is a baggage fee of 30.00 for the first bag.Now they are giving on the regular cabin sodas, cheese it  or cookies, not bad at all!Also they have quick snacks for sale.Definitively recommend it."
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Sometimes Not The Best Service,Check In CVG No One In Line But Me...Agents Standing There Doing Nothing Finally Decided To Work(And Didn’t Look To Happy About Having To Work) Did Something They Get Paid To Do...Flight Service 👍🏾Was Great CVG To LA...ReQuested Wheelchair Service For Assistance To Next Gate(Due To Having A Stroke)...Nothing But Empty Wheelchairs When I Got Off Plane..Since I Knew I Would Be Sitting Another 5 Hours Walked Instead....Flight To Maui Screens Didn’t Work.
Date of travel: December 2019,20,Airlines that squeeze blood from a stone,"Airlines these days seem to be scrimping and squeezing (literally) on every dollar they collect from us.  Delta is no exception.  No pillows.  No blankets.  Crammed seats.  Extra for a seat with a little more legroom in coach.  Extra for an emergency exit seat.  Extra for your FIRST checked bag.  Extra for Wi-Fi.  Extra for earbuds or headsets to partake of the in-seat entertainment center.  Extra for a ""snack"" other than Cheezits or almonds.  Heck, if that all isn't enough, my entertainment center wouldn't work properly (in a myriad of ways, I might add).  And because the flight was full, I was stuck in a too small seat without pillow or blanket, staring at at a screen that wouldn't work, on a flight from NYC to Tampa last week after a very difficult day.  Thank you, Delta."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Very Comfortable Flight,"I normally do not fly, and when I do, it usually is not Delta.  But in this case, it was the to-go-to airline for when I wanted to fly, and providing non-stop service to the destination airport.  The flight was comfortable with nice seats and professional staff."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,As simple and professional as you should expect.,Flight was trouble free and boarding in Atlanta with the towers that designate boarding stages works really great. There is less crowding and people in the way who are boarding at later stages.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Best large airline,Delta has done an excellent job empowering employees to be customer responsive.  The planes are clean.  The service is simple but pleasant.  On time service day after day with explanations of delays and the reason.  Much better overall focus than United or American (the latter is the worst).
Date of travel: December 2019,50,"Great service, on time arrival!","Gate agents were very hospitable, the flight was on time and the service was very good.  Food was tasty and the on board flight experience was great."
Date of travel: July 2019,50,Excellent Customer Service,"Amazing customer service - my flight got cancelled from LGA to TYS due to weather. I called Delta to see what flight they could get me on as I had an event in TYS the following morning. They went above and beyond and put me on the first flight the next morning. There were a ton of flight delays at LGA due to weather, but the Delta flight attendants did everything they could to help."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Altlanta Poor Service,"Due to several mistakes on the part of Delta, they flew slow, made several delaying off course adjustments to the flight path and then chose to stop at a gate that already had a plane parked, we missed our connecting flight by minutes.  The ground staff in Atlanta repeatedly told us we could try to wait for a flight, to Charlotte,NC. 10 hrs later.  They offered no help in any other way.  They repeatedly gave some useless corporate babble with no thought that we would be late for Christmas plans.  A stone has more compassion.   When I asked if they could help with a rental car or a hotel, they simply said no.  They did not even offer to help with finding our baggage.  Maybe it was just Atlanta, or the sad state of airlines, but how could this be a highly rated service company?  Walmart has better customer service and for $900 dollars less.  I rented a car and drove 4hrs 12/24/19.  I love to drive and it shows!  Now I get to go back to the airport to return the car when the rental agency opens.  Shame on Delta!  It is not a wonderful airline."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Better than what I expected!,"We usually hear bad experiences with flying american owned airlines but we had a pleasant experience with Delta.  It was our very 1st experience flying with them and we had a pretty good flight on going to and on our return from Lisbon.  It wasn't a direct flight from Toronto but thru JFK NY.  The layover was quite long but if the departing flight was delayed, we would still have enough time to catch our connecting flight. There are drawbacks in that if the flight is on time, then your layover would be longer.  Anyway the food served was good and acceptable.  The only thing I would like to comment is (and this goes to all other airlines as well) is that they have to manage the passenger's handcarry bagges.  The problem with some passengers is they carry more than what they are allowed to and ends up occupying the overhead storage which is taking away space from other passengers.  Some flights uses smaller planes so the overhead storage is quite small and limited."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,First Class in Delta ,"I purchased four FIRST CLASS DELTA Airplanes tickets for my family vacation travel from LAX to Punta Cana. After we arrived in LAX Delta sky lounge, we were informed that our First Class is not a Delta One international flight. Therefore, there is no Delta lounge access service provided. I told them that I have been charged for first class and there is no one told me that there are no airport lounge access. Be careful with Delta flight lounge NO access if you expect to be served as First Class passengers. I communicated with Delta customers services hotline and encouraged Delta airlines to call the Punta Cana First Class ticket as Economy Plus which passengers will not expect a First Class services. Be aware what you paid and what you may receive with Delta Airlines."
Date of travel: December 2019,20,Luggage being held hostage in Atlanta baggage office,"Internet down in SAC.  Missed connecting flight in Atlanta.  4-1/2 hrs later and the only other flight to MLI, My luggage didn’t make it.  MLI baggage office called Atlanta and they had it in their office and it would make it on the next morning flight.  No call the next afternoon, as promised, so I called Delta baggage.  On hold for 135 minutes.  It didn’t make it on that flight but would the evening flight.  Again, no call.  I now finally get ahold of MLi baggage, it is now scheduled for next day.  I escalated my voice and said all my @#$ Christmas presents are in that bag.  I then asked her name and she hung up on me.  I tried calling Atlanta baggage office, they don’t answer.  I have now been back on hold with Delta baggage for 95 minutes so far.  My luggage has a BIG tag with my name and phone # clearly written.  How can it be this hard?"
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Worst Christmas Vacation ever 😤😤,"Today was a long miserable day sitting at RDU international airport with multiple delays with Delta airlines. How do you tell your 5 children they can’t go on a cruise  due to flight delays by Delta... needless to say we had to break the news to them. Our flight was delayed 4 times today. Initially it was due to weather issues in Ft. Lauderdale Fl after the issue was resolved we had no flight attendants to board the plan so the that we could board our cruise ship in Ft. Lauderdale on time. We have spent over $14,000 for a Christmas cruise for our children and Delta first of all is not taking any blame for the delay of flights. They only offered to reimburse us for our flight tickets. And did not offer us one thing for our cruise that we have been planning and saving for 6 months. I have been on the phone all afternoon trying get some sort of reimbursement or future travel accommodations we haven’t gotten any where with this issue. I have asked to be redirected to the corporate office and all I have gotten was some reservation specialist who can do one thing for us to compensate us for our missed cruise. Now I am left with 5 children who’s saying this is the worst Christmas ever and it truly breaks my heart to see my children cry because they have a great Christmas experience. I suggest when you fly Delta to make sure they have all their flight attendants in place if they ever have a flight delay or work on rebooking another flight as soon as possible with another airline. I have been a lifetime customer of Delta and I have never receive such horrible service when it comes to a company error or delay in a flight. Our family Christmas cruise of 11 completely refined by Delta airlines."
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Watch out for flight and seat changes,Flights smooth and mostly on time; however flights and seats were changed without any notification. Knocked out of Comfort seats we paid for and to back of fully booked plane.  Can't rely on Delta to notify and took hours of my time to book flights similar in times to original booking?!!  Also to get refund from Delta.
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Whats the point of flying Delta,Whats the point of a web check in u cant block a seat. Whats the point of reaching the airport 5 hours early to drop off bags  at the airline counter if they ask you to go to the gate for seat allocation. Whats the point of reaching the gate early to find a long line for seat allocation and after all this u get a seat which is not what u want. Whats the point of flying Delta.
Date of travel: October 2019,40,OK Flight Through Bad Weather,"I have had bad experiences with Delta in the past, but this was the second leg of a trip and both flights went fine.  I have been crammed into Delta aircraft before, but seating and legroom, while hardly luxurious, were adequate.  The Philadelphia area was socked in by heavy rains.  The flight crew made a long descent through thick cloud cover and made a good landing on a wet runway."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Better Than Expected,"In past years I have had a series of bad experiences with Delta.  I flew them this time because of the fare price and the convenience of the flight times.  Customer service must have picked up in the interim, because this flight went off without a hitch.  I have always liked Delta flight crews, and this one made an exceptionally smooth landing in Atlanta.  Flying isn't much fun these days, but Delta did OK with this flight."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,AMAZING SERVICE,Basic ticket purchased in Nov.2019 for holiday celebration turned into a family emergency mid Dec 2019. Despite CRAZY 2019 holiday travel conditions Delta employees helped to easy my sad-traumatic holidays when my flight was delayed 3x messing up all connecting flights. Delta employees efficiently managed all changes WITHOUT charges. Delta Employees take care of EACH individual no matter the fare purchased. Also experienced OUTSTANDING service during hurricane Dorian. Delta Airlines is the BEST service all around - ticketing and inflight service.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Wonderful transatlantic flight,"I enjoyed a very nice flight from Spain to New York City. The food was amazingly good, and there were lots of extras even in Economy. I fell asleep when the menus came around and when I questioned what we were ordering, the flight attendant was a bit snippy. Surprising for a Delta flight. I've always had wonderful attendants. I guess he was having a bad day.I was seated in the exit row based on my ability to speak English when I checked in. The leg room is nice but the tray table is awful. It folds up out of the armrest and just isn't adequate. It's a balancing act to cut meat while not dumping the whole bowl on the floor.The onboard movies are nice, and there's plenty of time to watch. The flight was exactly eight hours. I also enjoyed the complimentary wifi so I could pass the time chatting with friends.By the end, the restroom closest to me had an overflowing trash bin and no toilet paper. But I reported it and it was dealt with. I consider the negatives a minor inconvenience compared to the value of an international flight.I liked that the luggage areas at JFK were clearly marked with the name of the city of origin of the flight and Delta's logo. It made it very easy to find.I feel Delta is working hard to be a great airline."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Don’t book a vacation with Delta airlines !,"We had a flight from sfo to haneda airport in Japan via lax - of course, the first flight was delayed but they didn’t tell us that before getting on or else we could have canceled the whole trip using insurance.  We find out when we land that they have bumped us to the next flight 24 hrs later - wtf!!! We had 30 mins to get to the other terminal to catch the next flight.  We had first class tickets booked the whole way and hotels but now we will be flying in comfort class !! Absolutely terrible service on all fronts regarding our baggage, our next flights etc - DO NOT USE DELTA vacations as it was a complete waste of time.  We should have just flown direct from sfo using Japan airways. - instead we are staying in a crappy courtyard by Marriott hotel until our next flight with $15 vouchers for food.  We will never book through them again."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Great service marred by dog too nearby.,"Delta is always my choice because of value for dollar, cleanliness and friendly service. We asked at the gate as usual to make sure no animals were near since i am so alergic and were assured none were within 3 rows. When we got seated a woman and dog were just in front with two vaccant seats beside her. when i complained to the attendent she suggested I move to a vacant seat at the rear of the plane. I have mobility issues and so this was not attractive. Why should I move when she is the one with the dog and not a support animal, just a pet? I had to deal with asthma because of this. I have since reported this to the company with no response."
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Return leg from Miami flew down on United,Coming home to Chicago even though had to make a stop in Atlanta proved better as it avoided traffic at O'hare back downtown also got to experience both the good and bad of Delta.On the flight from MIA to ATL the flight attendant in first was awful he could care less about proving for passengers let alone safety. He was too busy on his phone. I wish I had gotten his name and picture to report him.The second plane from Atlanta to Midway was just the opposite great friendly and personnel service. This flight attendant knew do how to work with people and it showed. I also wish I got his name and wold of provided 5 star report to Delta.Because we had the good and the bad was why I gave delta a 3 not 5 star review.  United on the other had coming to Miami was awesome!
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Very professional flight attendants,Very turbulent start but got better when the pilot changed altitudes.  It was so bad to start that the flight attendants could not serve beverages for an hour or more.  They made up for it later and the rest of the flight was good.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Near perfect flight with Delta,"Delta seems to be working hard to prove that they can compete with the Asian airlines on service. Nice new plane, large video monitors, menus offered of service, snacks in back in between. Pretty tasty food and beverage options. Staff were pleasant and professional. Nice job."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Canceled Flight,I have traveled very frequently for the last 20 years and this is my first review. This Delta flight from Minneapolis was an absolute disaster. 1) scheduled to leave at 8:35pm2) they announced they expected to leave early as it wasn’t a full flight.3)after the entire plane was boarded they announced we would need to wait on the plane until the got word if they could take off as there was bad Wheather in Saskatoon.4) 10 min later they said they had bad news and the flight was going to be delayed until tomorrow.5) unloaded plane6) waited 20min until they gave us and update at the gate7) flight was scheduled for 9am and due to wheather there was no hotels for anyone.8) they said they would get mats out for people to lie down on9) I went to hotel10) 10 pm got a text that the flight was cancelled until 12:45pm the next day11) here is the kicker 9 planes arrived in Saskatoon either 1 hour before the scheduled arrival or 1 hour after.12) Not one single flight was cancelled except Delta. (Really was wheather the problem).13) Last but not least when checking the arrivals in Saskstoon this flight is doesn’t even show up. It doesn’t show delayed nor cancelled. It just doesn’t show up. There is no way any bussiness should be allowed to do this to people. This is totally wrong. This is sickening.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great staff. Can’t wait to travel with them again !!,A1 service and great staff! Can’t wait to fly with them again  thank you !!! especially on flights DL 2696 ( Dec 13th) & DL 4474 (Dec 21).. hope the staff of those flights see my post & I wish them a VERY Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!! Keep up the great job❤️
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Very tight fit,"Buy you some snacks before you get to the airport, you will save a lot of money. Seats are tight even if you are not over weight."
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Delays..delays...and more delays.,We were an hour and a half delayed leaving New York.We’ve now been on ground 15 minutes in Gboro and can’t get to the gate. We flew out American and it was seemless. We will not chose Delta Again.
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Flight attendant recognized me,I was returning to work after a weekend at home and I ended up having the same flight attendant on the flight going back as I did coming. She had a rare weekend off as well. She recognized me which is rare seeing that she see's many people in her job. She said we would be taking off soon and she took good care of me on this flight. We even arrived about 15 minutes early!
Date of travel: December 2019,20,"Indifferent Service, Tasteless Vegetarian Food in Business Class","Flight was on time, check-in was ok, but service inside the plane was indifferent and lacked any warmth in Business Class. The polaris seating did not allow couple to seat next to each other. Had requested Vegetarian food, but it was tasteless and not even had a warm soup. Felt completely like a non-person. Only pleasant aspect was the pilot came and talked to the passengers before the flight"
Date of travel: December 2019,20,Worse than ever!,"Delta is the perfect ‘flagship’ airline for the United States - lower than budget carrier quality with premium airline prices. A pyramid scheme of a company with executive salaries through the roof at the expense of everyone else, including passengers. I have flown all over the world on many different airlines and, I must say, most American airlines are of inferior quality compared with the majority of others in the world - including budget carriers. The last time I flew Delta from JFK, the seats and isles were the narrowest, to the point of being hazardous, that I have ever seen.  Also, my girlfriend and I went out of our way to arrive at the gate on time. We had to compensate for unusual transit delays on the subway and thus ran 25 gates (about 1.2 miles) to the departure gate only to find upon arriving at the gate that departure was delayed over an hour and ZERO mention of this was made on the app or the scheduling screens in JFK. FINALLY, we boarded and it took forever because, like most American airlines , Delta has a RIDICULOUS AND MENTALLY DEGENERATE boarding process and baggage handling policy. Gone are the days, in America, of intelligent boarding from the back AND front doors - all passengers must wait in ridiculous lines and funnel into a single entrance and wait while fumbling, confused travelers struggle to shove their larger and larger ‘carry on’ bags. This is because Delta wants to save money in baggage handling and in order to check a bag you have to pay, so, everyone carries on. Talk about a bad policy! American carriers and companies in general are supposed to be THE BEST at ‘capitalism’, yet, they fail miserably to provide the most basic satisfactory services in a graceful non-ugly way. No first class company would make customers get out their wallets for 100 different basic necessities on a trip - bag check, food, baggage carts(American airports) etc. The list goes on when, instead it should be complimentary and built into the fare or , as reality may be, taken out of executives’ huge salaries. So ugly, so greedy these people. As if they need more government subsidies! Delta paid ZERO federal income tax last year. When a company can’t figure out how to make the majority of customers happy AND make a profit, there is a big problem. Either it is greedy executives or bad management and ‘herd mentality’ business practices. Probably all three and then some! Shame on Delta’s greedy, incompetent leaders for failing utterly to live up to their brands own standards."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,London to New York on Delta A330-200,"I flew back from London a few days ago on one of Delta's A330-200's.  This was an older plane but was new in terms of the cabin; it had the Delta One business class product.  I was wondering how much I would like this plane having just flown the A350-1000 a few days earlier.  I needn't have worried as the flight was very smooth and the plane in very good condition.  The only issue was a near 3 hour delay due to a mechanical issue with the plane.  I was impressed that the captain told us about the issue as it was engine related and could have freaked out some people, which it did.  One passenger had extreme anxiety and had to get off the plane.  This forced a delay of another 15 minutes while they searched for her bag.  Anyway, once in the air it turned out to be a very good flight.  The seat was comfortable; even more so when the person sitting next to me moved up to the row ahead leaving me alone in ""my"" row!  The IFE was good in terms of selection but a little dated in terms of screen size and airshow options.  Let's talk about the food and service.  First, I was given a menu.  That was a first for me in economy.  The choices were limited but just getting a menu was a plus.  The food was good by economy standards maybe even really good.  The service was also very good.  Hot towels were passed around before the service started and garbage was picked up regularly.  This plane had WiFi and it worked really well.  I was able to get some work done for a few hours.  The only issue I personally experienced was an USB port that wouldn't charge my phone.  This was less of an issue for me since I had the row to myself and just used the other one.  Funny story; when the flight attendant was making the initial welcome on-board announcement, she called the plane a Boeing A330 before quickly correcting herself with Airbus A330. Lol. Overall, very impressed with Delta and will definitely fly them again."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Pre Christmas visit,"I have never flown with Delta before, and I must say I was very impressed.The leg room in economy was great.The stewards were fantastic, and very polite & helpful.I would say that the food onboard is probably the best I’ve eaten."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Montana to Florida was a fine ride!,"I was very pleased with the very modern and comfortable aircraft. Legroom was fine, even in economy. Great service and everything on time. Couldn't be happier. Return flight on Delta was not comparable at all. Tiny seats without legroom and none of the modern amenities on backrest."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Best of the Best,Just when you think the customer service cannot get any better it does. We left Pensacola enroute to Boston via Atlanta and the service from baggage and check in and especially the flight attendants was absolutely the best in my 40 plus years of flying. I would like to especially thank Janelle who was on our flight Delta 2715. She personifies all the skills to be the best of the best. Thanks Janelle and thank you Delta Airlines.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Birthdays sojourn,"Nice flight, everything on time. Made connection at CDG in Paris to Venice with ease. Because we are frequent flier members our checked luggage is tagged priority, is marked as such and usually comes to the carousel at the final destination early."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great experience,"Round-trip from Detroit to Paris was fantastic both ways. All flights were on time, all airline employees were courteous and attentive."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Going up!,"Things at Delta are getting better and its noticeable. They have modernised in a way that no other US carrier appears to have (except JETBLU maybe) and the positive impact of this on my experience means they'd win my business again. Staff friendly, helpful and nothing was too much trouble. The flight attendants were just brilliant.Food and beverage was better than anything I've had trans-atlantic before.Ground experience was smooth, no stress just a 'have a good flight' outlook."
Date of travel: December 2019,20,"Flight attendants great, but not so much for every other aspect of the flight","The flight was delayed, but you accept that.  The pitch was terrible; my knees were jammed against the seat in front of me before the word ""recline"" came into play.As noted in the title, the flight attendants were great, although they didn't let anyone sit in the empty bulkhead row.  BTW, I forgot to mention that my reserved seat was in row 30, but somehow, when I checked in, I was in row 40-something.  No explanation given, and the gate agents did not answer any questions; they sealed off their area for ""TSA security"".  Then, when I got to Atlanta, late, and then get through customs, I go to my gate.  They're boarding group 1, so I stop by a restroom.  When I get back, they're still boarding group 3, but my seat is gone because I didn't ""present myself to the gate on time"".  Given that I was in group 3, no idea how that works.  Incredibly unhappy to be demoted to standby for the next connecting flight, which was full ...  I won't be checking Delta first for my next flight ...."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Long haul flight from New York to Sao Paulo!,Flew Delta's A330 from JFK to Sao Paulo!!    Seat pitch was pretty decent and movie selection was also fairly good.    Excellent dinner and breakfast in terms of quality and quantity.   Cabin crews were cheery and friendly.   Definitely exceeded my expectation.
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Adequate,Delta always does a good job and we fly with them 90% of the time.  Their attendants are courteous. The seats are hard to recline. The leg space is minimal.
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Bait and switch sky club and poor service in the air and on the ground ,"Purchased first class from st Martin to SLC with a connection in atl.  SXM is the new Islamabad but with less AC and organization. Unorganized, chaotic, and uncaring contract employees. The flight was marginally better with a sweltering hot plane and little service due to some very minor bumps. We were denied the sky club in Atlanta because even though we were first class and it was international travel, there is a small note somewhere that the Caribbean isn’t considered international travel for purposes of the sky club, or that’s at least what the snarky customer service rep stated at the desk. Lovely. Thank you delta for helping us spend our money on future travel elsewhere."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,"Probably the worst Airline I have ever flown, will never fly this airline again.","I had a horrible experience with the Delta flight attendants. Apparently to sit in the exit row, a passenger has to ""understand"" English. The two Delta flight attendants asked my mother a question in English, which wasn't clear and given that her native tongue isn't English, they decided without any hesitation to move me and my mother to separate seats, without offering me a refund. They claimed i would get a refund, and it was only a $100 upgrade, but the principle is what i am more concerned about. Both these two Delta flight attendants need to be fired and hope they will be. Without any hesitation, they pulled me and mother aside, and handed my seats to two other passengers. Honestly its a disgrace how this is customer service on Delta and most American airlines. Its a disgrace and its sad."
Date of travel: November 2019,10,Flight Line SIN to NRT Deleted,"Book 2 tickets for Premium Economy from SIN to NRT, due to Delta Airline deleted this flight line eternally, was direct to ANA for this trip. But when boarded to the ANA airplane, was direct to Economy seat instead. When enquire, was direct back to Delta Airline customer service as direction was to Economy seat. After returned from this trip, enquire was make again & was offer for a $200 voucher for the next trip! I can't find any flight line for my next travel thru Delta Airline, voucher last for a year. So I have paid extra for nothing?"
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Quick Christmas Trip,"No a bad airline, surprised to see dogs in a seat... seems like a lot of family fly on here so its full of kids...but not bad seats, it was one of the top airlines for flying I guess"
Date of travel: November 2019,20,"Flight itself was sort of OK, but the ground staff in NYC are horrible","Even though we have the free bag status we were charged $100. to check bags. There was no discussion, no possible solution even though it clearly states we have that perk. There was nothing to do but pay up or choose not to fly, so we had to pay up. The staff were surly and rude and slow and nearly abusive.The actual flight was OK, but the earlier experiences in the airport put me off using Delta the next time I need to go through or be in , NYC."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,good flight,"Just started with flying with Delta, this trip Milwaukee to Amsterdam. A good flight including the connection in Detroit.  The ground crew was nothing to be noted, at MKE or DTW - except the face recognition slows down the boarding. Seat on the A320 was new and the IFE was up to date and responsive, however the A330 to Amsterdam needs an update, IFE was slow not responsive my seat was broken the flight was full. The economy comfort has good legroom. Restrooms were maintained during the flight. Crew was nice. There were also snacks and water in the back galley. Food, in my opinion was untouchable."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Terrible,"Absolutelly terrible.We were flying between Sydney, Australia and Washington D.C for the start of a 3 week holiday in the U.S. We chose Delta for our third leg between New York and D.C., as the flew out of JFK were we landed with Qantas. As we were flying first class/business class with Qantas all the way from Sydney to JFK, we decided to get first class tickets with Delta. Big mistake.The flight departed from JFK Terminal 2 that is old as anything, and as it was snowing outside, the entire building was freezing.To our surprise, our first class tickets did not give us access to the lounge so we had to pay to get in US$29 each. It is not about the money but the principle.We flew an old Boeing 717 plane. Freezing cold, worn out and smelly inside.The crew lacked any kind of customer service skills. They did not stop gossiping between each other for the entire trip, ignoring passengers requests. From the gate, to the taxiing on the tarmac, to the flight and once we have landed in D.C. They never stopped.No food besides some basic nuts and small crackers that could be found at any corner shop.The only good memor we keep is the nice ladies at the lounge reception.Please stop calling it first class.Appaling. Never again."
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Delta - same old stuff,"Charges for baggage are ridiculous. So few people check bags and $30 is too much. The only positive thing about these flights is that the seatbelts are longer on the newer planes,"
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Checking Bags on Delta at Boston Logan?  Don’t Even Think About It,"On two consecutive occasions, I’ve had morning flights out of Boston on Delta.  The first time, we showed up in plenty of time.  We checked in on line so all we had to do was drop bags to check.  We dutifully went to the bag drop kiosk, punched in information, and got luggage claim tickets.  Next stop, we need to drop off the bags.  Guess what?  There was no way to do that!  We were told to get in the long long non-moving line that handled everything—-booking, check in etc.  That made no sense, and I told they employee so, and he suggested that curbside might be faster.  We went out there and after a long wait, were able to drop off our bags.  We lamented our story to the curbside guy, and he just shrugged and said Delta didn’t staff the desks inside.So, three weeks later, same thing.  We go straight to the curbside though, and they we’re pulled out of that line (it was barely moving) and told to go inside, with others.  We did that, but shouldn’t have.  Word passed around that Delta didn’t staff the desks until 8AM, so there was a HUGE jam at that time.  We waited and waited.  Finally, we were told that, even though we arrived for our flight 2 hours before boarding, there was no way we would make our flight.  We had to go to special services and then wait again.  They rebooked our flight with two stops rather than the nonstop we had originally booked.  Just a vapid, “we’re sorry” was given. Lessons:  1.  Don’t Fly Delta out of Boston if you have checked bags.2.  If you can’t follow #1, just break line and go straight to the counter, first class, whatever.  If Delta doesn’t respect you, why should you have to respect their “lines”.   Anarchy is better than futility.3.  Look at social media for all of the video and rants going on today, Sat Dec 21, re Delta in Boston if you think I’m overstating things."
n/a,10,More delays...just like last Thanksgiving,"See my previous review. No better so far. No heat to plane as the pilot just said the ground power unit ""took a dump on us""...meaning it ran out of fuel. Now being refueled...another Delta Burlington Vermont issue. Hopefully we can make it on time. Current temp is 16 degrees with a NICE breeze. Ugh."
n/a,10,Bungled from start to end,Delayed departure from BTV. Sat at gate in DTW for 15 minutes because they could not get the jetway moved. Only made the flight to DEN because 15 others on first leg were on same flight. Flights attendants rude and arrogant. I am a platinum medallion member so not a newbie to Delta. Their services is undergoing a vast degradation.
Date of travel: October 2019,10,Ms,"Flight was delayed because crew member was late,Departure time was 7:30 AM at 8:15 AM crew called me that if we didn’t leave now I will miss my connecting flight.I was told I can take a United Flight that is about to depart then crew member show up they decided to go we departed 8:45 AM barely made it to connecting flight.I lost my reading glasses with what happened and was offered a $100 voucher.I paid $450.00 to replace it.Very diasspointed Return flight was worse 0ct 25,2019 it was cancelled.I was rebooked next day with United Airlines and have to pay the luggage fee.Reason for cancellation is mechanical failure,very disappointed."

Date of travel: December 2019,10,"Flights late, connections blown, bags lost; what a mess!","We’re no newbies to travel, but flying Delta from US to Europe was among the worst bungles we’ve ever experienced. Our first leg flew more than an hour late so we missed our connecting flight to Amsterdam, and from that moment things rapidly descended into a 20-hour nightmare of ineptly booked alternate flights that had to be changed again and constant questions about where our bags were — questions that continued for four days after arrival in Spain where we lived in increasingly smelly clothes while receiving constant notices that our bags would be found and delivered, but never were. (We finally returned to the airport and found they’d been stored there all along.) Delta’s mistakes were primarily systemic. They book tight connections yet contract the small-city domestic flights to Skywest, which is no more reliable than a two-dollar watch; they rebook alternate flights without regard to details like connecting times; the gate agents promise to locate bags and then forget to do so, while others promise to correct that mistake and merely make it worse; phone support to locate lost luggage is nonexistent, etc.If there’s anything positive to be said about Delta, it’s merely that you’ll better appreciate other airlines!"

Date of travel: December 2019,30,"Atlanta to JFK, find a your food at the airport","Afternoon Flight out of Atlanta to JFK. The Airport in Atlanta was packed! Expect delays and get there 2-3 hours early.  The Flight is short but long enough to hope for a bit to eat, that is not happening on this flight, so find some food on your own, I was with family and some of us got grumpy.  Atlanta is a much less expensive place to eat than JFK.  Also carry on luggage in this plane dosent fit in the center over head compartment on the outside compartments, makes that space a premium...great job design engineer...set a standard and then dont meet it?!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great flight experience!,Overall seamless flights in the busy holiday season! Had a tight connection and we arrived early in my connecting airport so I had extra time to get water and snacks before boarding my next plane
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Losers,"We scheduled a round trip from NYC to Pittsburgh. Called to change only the return from Pittsburgh to NYC instead to Savannah to NYC. The first time we called, the Delta representative lied about the total of the ticket change for the flight back, saying it was cheaper to change the flight home, for $200 total for two tickets; however, I was charged $480. So we call back. Thankfully get a refund and now buy two separate individual tickets cheaper than $480 total, however; they forgot to complete our trip online. So it's a day before our flight out to Pittsburgh from NYC and there is no flight to be found. Just called, after an hour wait, and they found the trip on their end. Seriously, with the amount you pay, how difficult is it to have someone just FINALIZE the trip online?"
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Beware before booking,"Booked trip through Travelocity to fly Delta to Grenada for spring break. A month and a half later Delta inexplicably cancelled the flight and refunded tickets, leaving us without transportation to a non-refundable hotel room. Delta did not assist with related expenses and I was told I could book another (more expensive) flight. Fortunately was able to negotiate refund of all other expenses from Travelocity, including travel insurance. Very upset when the flight to Grenada reappeared for booking a short time later. It appears Delta’s desire to maximize profits cost my family vacation plans. Don’t risk your vacation."
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Delta LAX to JFK,"Flying from Sydney Australia to New York on two flights with a 2 hour layover was not enough to make the delta flight. Delta took it in their stride with 25 fellow passenger being put onto a flight 2 hours later. Seems like this I a regular occurrence. Even with a longer layover of 4 hours just make it to terminal 2 to take the LAX to NYC flight. Arrived at the gate just as boarding started. Plane was then delayed as all passengers were loaded and about to take off when the crew then realised they did not have enough food for the additional passengers. The rear door was opened so extra food could come in along with the unpleasant smell of fuel vapours. Staff were abrasive, and stroppy and clearly not happy about extra passengers. Limited choice of food.  When snacks were served passengers were told of the 4 options over PA system and were told cabin staff would not be repeating them to passengers as they are not parrots! And to add if you did not say  what you want immediately when asked the decision would be made for you by the cabin staff."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Lima to Atlanta,It was a great flight and comfortable.  The only reason for a 4 is that before the flight we went to the airline lounge and we were sent to another one and that one would not let us purchase an entrance for our traveling companion.  They sent us back to the first one and then we had to pay for three entrances.
Date of travel: April 2019,20,Won't take this airline for overseas again,"Flew non-stop from PDX to AMS and it was terribly tight and uncomfortable for that long of a flight.  The aisles are the normal narrow width making it hard to get up and walk much, the seats were the normal small seats.  For a shorter flight it would be doable but not overseas.  Never again."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Another great Delta flight experience,"I usually have great experiences flying Delta, and this trip was no exception. Each year we fly to Las Vegas from the east coast to visit family around the holidays, and since the flight is long, I prefer to book Delta, which generally makes the experience as pleasant as possible! This flight was particularly noteworthy, as we were upgraded to first-class thanks to my medallion status. I hadn't flown first class on Delta on such a long flight before, and it was wonderful-- genuinely good food, a comfortable seat with lots of room, and terrific service. I definitely also enjoyed the in-flight entertainment, as I always do. All in all, I've found Delta to be the most consistently positive US domestic airline, and I know I'll fly again!"
Date of travel: December 2019,20,Pay more for selecting a seat?,"Today's air traveler is at an extreme disadvantage when hoping to have a comfortable experience. Seats are smaller, more tightly packed and service is minimized for all but first and business classes. On long trips, or should you need to make a connection pick an isle seat since airlines rarely let passengers with close connections off of the airplane first.Clearly people with no carry-on its should be placed closest to the exit to speed the boarding and unbarring of the air craft, but this is not a standard adopted for convenience or speedy movement of the passengers.When buses and trains are more comfortable than economy class flying, you know that you are in for a challenging --if not always rewarding flight."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Delta Airlines,"Roomy seats even in the ""basic ticket"" seats and everyone can watch TV or movies. Its great! Flight attendants came around several times to offer drinks and snacks."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Comfortable and free movies,"The seats are always comfortable on Delta, even in economy class, and the free movies and tv shows make the trip fast. Just remember bring your headphones. Airline charges 2.00 if you forget them."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Actually enjoyable air travel,"Pleasant employees, smooth trip, and arrived ahead of time....priceless! Delta has consistently provided convenient travel times and excellent customer service."
Date of travel: August 2019,20,Two Delays due to mechanical plane issues,The flight from Singapore had mechanical issues and were delayed every hour on the hour until 2:00pm when then cancelled the flight.  I was rebooked on the same plane to leave at the same time the next day.  The next day the same thing happened due to the plane not being repaired. I did eventually leave late in the afternoon only to miss my connection in Tokyo.  Delta is discontinuing this leg in asia pacific and letting their airline partners take this over which is a good idea after this experience.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,First Class worth every penny for a transatlantic flight!,Service in the first class cabin is marvelous. Almost instant response when you request something. My only ongoing complaint is that the seat that folds flat is too firm. My shoulders hurt after sleeping in the bed. There should be a way to adjust the firmness of the sleeping surface.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Always pleasant and courteous service!,I was traveling with my parents and requested wheel chairs for them. Everyone was very nice and helpful. The airline seats are reasonably comfortable and I love having the screen in the seats to watch the flight details and/or watch a movie!
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Good service,"Delta has good service, clean planes, friendly flight attendants.  They are not super punctual, but not terribly far off off most of the time."
Date of travel: December 2019,30,"Little crowded, bad connection.","Plane was sold out, on check-in offered ""free"" bag check on flight due to lack of space in overhead  crew appeared somewhat disorganized in assisting passengers with seating. Flight was mundane but at connection was not afforded enough time to deplane traverse the airport for connection, this worked both on the flight out and return.  Be it shown that crew was helpful and nice on all flights however was not well versed in boarding and deplaning such crowded flights."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Good flight but a little long,Flight was good. Our departure was delayed about an hour because we waited for other passengers with connecting flights. At first I was a little annoyed but then I realized if I was one f the delayed passengers I would be grateful. I like Delta. They are my preferred carrier. Service is always good and the agents are helpful and courteous.
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Worst experience ever,Line was over an hour long to just check a bag. Once I went to check bag they wouldn’t even follow their own guidelines and then we’re rude and unhelpful. Had to cancel my flight to return a bag to home and miss work because they can’t even follow their own policy. Which I tried to call and confirm the night before and left me on hold for 45 minutes before hanging up. Worst customer service ever
Date of travel: December 2019,20,"You are kidding me, right?","All I can say is be prepared!  I was under the impression that our bags were included in our flight cost....NOPE.  It was extra for all checked baggage.  Then the seats were unbelievably SMALL!  I was almost sitting on top of the person next to me  and she on me.  The person seated in front of us had a crying child from the time she got on the plane.  I understand because I've traveled with my child and know you need to be as prepared as you can be.  She changed a very dirty diaper in an empty seat and had only a little for the little one to eat.  The stewardesses didn't help much either.  There were other children on the plane that we didn't hear a peep from.  I'm about 5'4 and I had little leg room.  Why are we paying the airfare we are and the inside of the planes being so small?  I'm asking for more comfort for my money.  I don't need or want them to feed me but at least make us comfortable while we are in your plane.  Also, once we landed we were lost on where to go to find baggage and the stewardess didn't help.  A young man finally helped us.  We had no clue what a ""jitney"" was nor could we understand what they were trying to say while on the plane speakers.  Please speak up about the plane conditions."
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Not as good as I hoped ,"Not sure what I was expecting after having the joy of a virgin flight inbound, this flight home was poor in comparison, the plane was dirty inside and organisation was not what it should have been, the flight attendants were always battling unruly Americans who ignored the fasten seatbelt signs and just did what they wanted really, flight attendants lost control over this which seemed strange maybe they are used to having Americans ignore safety signs during turbulence etc,Would of paid extra if I knew or ensured I had a virgin flight on my return"
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Delta is greatly inferior to American,Purchased a business class ticket from ohare to Panama through ATL.  I was not granted access to the lounge.  The flight attendants on both legs were more interested in their phones than providing service.  Nice job Delta.  You demonstrated great customer service.  The last time for me.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,GOOD TO THE VERY LAST STOP,"Everyone involved in our experience was exceptionally professional. From the time we were wheeled to the door until we deplaned in Atlanta, we were met with the utmost in kindness and consideration.  The flight from Atlanta was pleasant. and uneventful.  One of the flight attendants on that leg of the trip had graduated the week prior. You would never have known that she was new at the position. She handled her duties with ease and confidence  . It may have been due to the patience ,professionalism and attitude of her trainer, who allowed her to just do her job. Hopefully I will have the opportunity to fly with them again in the near future."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Nice flight,"No delays, no problems.We got a good service for a good price, food was good, service was great. I would use Delta again."
Date of travel: December 2019,20,Rude customer service,The gate check in agent has an attitude and is rude to customers.  I understand she is busy and has to talk to a lot of customers but this should not be a reason for a rude service.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Sonoma Here We Come,"Round Trip, 2 legs each way.  Good service, friendly attendants.  Pleasant trip.  Transfers at the intermediate stop were easy.  Bags made it without a hitch."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Home for the Holidays Delta made it a treat,"Skymiles status upgraded me, as is often the case, to First.  Pleasant flight (a transfer in Atlanta --of course)."
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Mixed Bag,"The long, long flight from Atlanta to Kona was almost perfect. Because of an issue with my knee I had requested a wheelchair to get through the airport to my connecting flight. Attendant was very nice and connection was pleasant. We were treated so well on the flight that it almost seemed like first class international.  Everything was different on the return through Honolulu, Seattle, Atlanta, Lexington.  Wheelchair attendant in Honolulu was more concerned with getting his tip than anything else. Attendants in Seattle were lovely and so considerate, but Delta changed my seat assignment without telling me to a window in some kind of uncomfortable add in seat at back of the first class cabin, but not first class. The cold air coming from the window and wall had me chilled through in the first 30 minutes. When I complained that I was cold the flight attendants just smirked to each other and ignored me. They did not even offer a blanket. Being locked into the window made it very difficult and painful to get out when we finally arrived.  There were no wheelchairs waiting in Atlanta and I had to limp out to check on my very tight connection and was able to get one of the just arriving wheelchairs. The attendant was rude, more concerned with getting off work and chatted with a co-worker all the way down the concourse. Never offered to stop at a restroom and parked the chair at the end of the hallway in what appeared to be a staging area with at least a dozen other disabled passengers with no explanation.  There was one very stressed young woman trying to organize the chaos and when I  expressed concern about making my connection she would not listen to what I was saying.  Finally, totally exasperated, I got up and limped across the hall to the restroom. When I exited, there was a very concerned attendant waiting for me to get me to my final flight to Lexington.  Delta really impressed me on the outbound flight, but, with the exception of the lovely wheelchair attendant in Seattle and the guy in Kona who made sure I had plenty of time to climb the stairs onto the plane,  the return trip was absolutely miserable. I am 75 years old, have travelled a lot all over the world , and have always been a loyal Delta customer, but in future I will be exploring other options"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great International Flight Service!,"Long flights like this one(11 hours) can be almost unbearable as was my outgoing Alitalia Flight from Los Angeles. Delta offered superb inflight service, even in economy. The flight attendants could not have been nicer coming by regularly offering water and snacks between meals, even bringing us hot chocolate chip cookies half way through the trip.The plane was clean and as comfortable as possible. I would rate this flight close to the service received on Singapore Air and New Zealand air, my favorites."
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Uninspired,"I should begin this review by stating that I am a Platinum Medallion frequent flyer who holds similar status on a competing airline. I chose to take this trip with Delta for three reasons: 1. It was the fastest trip to my destination 2. I was interested in the new aircraft and main cabin service 3. I needed the miles to maintain status on the carrier. Let’s hone in on #2. Delta has been promoting their improved level of service in the main cabin for the past few months. I typically fly internationally in business class, but was intrigued by the First Class influenced service service in the main cabin. I ended up purchasing economy comfort seats and looked forward to trying a long haul flight outside of my comfort zone. As the trip approached 30 days until departure, I looked at my seat assignments and noticed that I was in comfort seats for only 4 out of 6 legs of the trip. I called the Platinum line and asked for this to be corrected, but was declined due to the two legs belonging to partner carriers. (This was not disclosed on the purchase page of Delta’s website.) Since this was out of Delta’s capabilities, I asked to just upgrade to business class and pay the difference. Again, the answer was no. As I am hearing this, I had Delta’s website up and was looking at a minimum of 4 open business class seats per leg. I explained this to the Delta agent and her recommendation was to call back in a couple of days and see if the seats open up. I did this for 2 weeks, but continued to get the run-around from Delta. In the end, I never got a straight answer from the airline and sat in the seats that were originally assigned. The long haul economy comfort seats from SEA to ICN were okay. The new A330 Neo was a wonderful aircraft and the amenities were well thought out. The high touch service that Delta promoted fell flat for me. The crew lacked personality and appreciation for the guests on the airplane. The food was decent sans the bubbly plastic flatware. ICN to DPS was fulfilled by Korean Airlines, so I will forego feedback for this flight. DPS to SYD was fulfilled by Virgin Australia. Although and excellent flight, I will forego feedback here as well. SYD to LAX was a Delta 777, which seemed like an older aircraft managed by a tired / crabby flight team. Similar experience as the SEA flight. Elevated service meant a welcome drink a little under an hour into the flight, a touch better food and standard flight attendants who rather be somewhere else. Overall, spending 49 hours in the air with Delta / Delta partners was underwhelming. Adding to the frustrating 3-4 hours spent trying to get seat assignments just made the trip worse. I’d recommend Delta training their flight crews to believe in the product/ service that is being marketed to the travelers. If my experience is similar to others, I think the airline loses credibility and customers as a result."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,NYC 11-2019 Weekend Trip,"Overall this flight went pretty smoothly for our trip NYC. We spent the weekend there as my daughter was auditioning for Americas's Got Talent. Anyway, we did a little sight seeing before and after the audition. The return flight went pretty smoothly as well."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Actual inflight was good,"Hour late leaving Burbank--not seated at check-in--gate seating and only to Atlanta--had to gate seat again in Atlanta (on trip from Roanoke/Burbank was seated all the way thru) have NEVER had this happen before on ANY airline.  We were given good seats, however, the fact that we had to deal with getting seat assigned at gate again in Atlanta was totally outrageous, and I would think time consuming for Delta."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,"Great Exit, No Food on Return!","The flight and the flight attendants were wonderful both on the way there and on the way back.  Both planes on the way to Bonaire had everything, working entertainment, plenty of refreshments, meals to purchase and great service.  The return flight leaving Bonaire did not have working entertainment in all seats including one of ours so no distractions for the 4 hour flight and then they ran out of ALL purchasable food about a third of the way through the passengers.  So two thirds of the hungry passengers were offered an extra package of crackers or cookies and a soft drink.  There is no excuse for this, even with the excuse that the plane was supplied in Atlanta and not in Bonaire.  The airline is fully aware of how many passengers would be on those 2 flights and should have supplied adequately for both flights.  Thankfully we had just enough layover to get a bite to eat so we did not have to go 18 hours without food other than a package of crackers.Otherwise, things were fine.  I believe for the cost to fly these days that the entertainment promised and the food truck should be able to do what both are intended to do.  So, maintain your equipment and put some extra food on the damn plane!"
Date of travel: December 2019,20,Smoke filled cabin,15 minutes into the flight the cabin started filling with smoke and we turned around. The San Juan airport was chaotic and unorganized. We waited for hours to get vouchers for room and food to stay overnight until we could get a new plane. It was a huge inconvenience and I was offered $75 for my troubles (other passengers were given $100) to use on my next flight. I don't think I will be flying again. It was terrifying.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Covenience,"DTW had flights but for the cost difference the convenience of flying out of a closer airport  was worth the extra $50. You still have to wait at ATL either way. Smaller airports have a tendency of having free gate baggage check. Flint is a small clean airport with cheap, convenient parking. (DTW is still one of the  cleaner large airports) Returning on a late night flight to FNT it was nice not having a long ride home."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Going to Florida tosee my children who live there,"Been flying Delta for years even when it was Northwest, never had a problemwith them, the airport is first class, I checkmy luggage inat the curb thengo throughsecurity and then stop for breakfast at one of the restaurants on the concourse,I like the video games on the back of the seats on the plane, as I have said I have never had a problem with Delta"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Short Trip,First I want to state that I always enjoy flying with Delta.  This trip was a bit different aswe had a 2 hour delay because of weather in Boston.   It was snowing that morning and they needed to de-ice the plane and that was the reason for the delay.  They were very good at updating us and did serve drinks.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Rn,Left a couple min. Late from Seattle but arrived early in Cincinnati. Friendly attendances and pilot kept us update on weather and arrival times
Date of travel: December 2019,50,great service from Delta,"its a 9.5 hrs non stop flight. all the flight attendants were very attentive. I ordered special meals so my meal got served first. since I was sitting all the way back of the plane if I did not order special meal it would take another 45 mins before they get to me. Meals were good, I ordered Asian veg. but it actually was a Halal meal they served me. for dessert was ice cream, Yummy!they serve drinks couple of times and snacks were at the back so all were welcome to go back to get them but THEY DID not announce it to the passengers. I just knew because that is how it is with long international flights.MOVIES selections were good too. I watched 5 first run movies!."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,great flight,on time and smooth flight  found enough over head room for bag.  good entertainment system and snacks.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Always consistent,I always know what to expect when I fly Delta...consistent operations and great service. I always fly Delta even if another airline is less expensive or faster.  Loyal passenger.
Date of travel: November 2019,20,Rattle trap equipment,"The plane was really uncomfortable and in rough shape on my flight to SLC: the seat in front of me was broken, and when the person seated there reclined it, it went too far back and was crooked into my space. Many of us (including me) had no access to the inflight entertainment (our screens on the seats in front of us were not working), there was no water for flushing the toilets, and the flight attendants could not process credit cards for food purchases due to some sort of electrical/technology glitch. The equipment for my return flight was incomparably better."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Service with a smile,"Transoceanic travel is brutal but Delta goes the extra mile to take the sting out. Even in economy, we were given warm towels, a packet with ear plugs and eye patches then surprised with a Bellini. Yes please! The food was delicious and there was even a snack basket at the back of the plane if you got the munchies. Yes, the leg room is limited but that's what we paid for. We were grateful for the touches of care that made this an enjoyable flight. Thank you, Delta, you're my first go to when flying!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"Up,up and away!","On Nov.4th I flew business class non-stop from Seattle to Milan. The service was wonderful, especially  my flight Host named Evan. He made the flight fantastic. This is the third time I have flown Delta overseas and I will do it again."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Travel by air,"My flight with Delta went well. Both flights I had were on time, comfortable and had pleasant flight attendants. The ticket agents greeted me with a smile and were very informative. I’ll be more than happy to flight with Delta again."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,One of the best experiences,"I have an emotional support animal and traveling with other airlines - united- has beed a headache. Imagine my surprise when Delta made the transactions go smoothly, they gave me priority boarding and since the flight was not full they placed me in an seat row (of just two seats) all by myself. I have never been treated so kindly and have staff been so accommodating when it comes to flying. Delta is a little bit more expensive that other airlines but whit this treatment I can see the value in it :)"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Delta Did Everything Right,The flights were on time.  People throughout were very professional and polite. The plane was clean.  The luggage got there.  The food was quite good for airline food.  Communication through e-mail was good.  In flight entertainment was good.
n/a,50,Good Flight,"Left McCarren at 0700, so we were at the airport early. TSA was fairly busy, due to several events in the City. The Clear line was empty and we zipped through. Several places were open early for food, coffee, etc.  Flight was full, but we left and arrived on time. ATL was packed at 1:40pm on arrival. TSA and Clear jammed."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,"Just like a bus, get in your seat and get to where you're going","Delta is almost always on time with a professional flight crew.  It's just that flying today is basically like being on a bus (except for the snacks).  We did experience the ""Best' landing ever when returning to Atlanta, didn't even feel the wheels hit the runway!We always fly Delta if it's a choice to use where we are headed."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,First Class Service,Excellent flight crew!  These people really go way out to make your flight as comfortable & enjoyable as possible!  Delta is my go-to airline!
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Smooth Flight with Excellent Service,"I had a terrific experience flying from Boston to Grand Cayman. The flight was very smooth and we only were 20 minutes off from our estimated arrival. The flight attendants were very helpful, they even helped me store my luggage. I would've preferred additional snacks but that is how it goes. I will definitely look to fly Delta on my next adventure!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,I love Delta,"The service from Delta is always top notch, this is why I'm a loyal Delta SkyMiles member.  I've been seated in 1st class, business and economy and have always been treated with respect and kindness. The flight attendants are truly pleasant and love to serve. Good selection of  complimentary snacks and beverages The baggage claim was a breeze on both departure and return. I try to do curb check-in if available, the staff are so kind, considerate and fast if you have all your info ready for them. Seats are comfortable but have noticed over the years that the underseat storage is getting shorter. I know this because I've been using the same carry-on bag for 25+ yrs. In the beginning it fit under seat perfectly and did not stick out, now It sticks out about 5-6 inches on most planes."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Sw is way better,"Garbage,trash,never flyind Delta ever again. Late,moved my seat, 2 times in a row, no reclining seat. Seperated seating bought together, not even nearby,opposite ends of the plane!"
Date of travel: December 2019,10,horrible handlers of luggage and poor policies,"My luggage which was brand new was completely destroyed almost to the point where its grossly negligent on the part of this airline. my luggage arrived to its location with only one of the 4 wheels still barely intact. i was completely ruined and was impossible for me to carry a 40 pound bag from the airport to my hotel via the subway or anyway. i am 4 months pregnant and had no choice but to get another luggage in the airport that doesn’t go with the brand new set i bought before leaving and it’s not hard shell as i prefer. i was told in the baggage  claim issue office that they could send me a check to reimburse me for my luggage  so i may replace it now today when i file a claim Delta Airlines all are saying i can get a delta ticket credit or i must replace my bag from Delta Airlines online catalog which is crazy because my luggage was way cuter and goes with a set and i don’t have the option when going to the luggage site  Delta Airlines all offered. i am not made whole and actually lost a lot by flying delta, i am extremely disappointed and plan to report this to every outlet possible because its unjust and unfair. i want my exact luggage replaced . then Delta Airlines all had the nerve to offer me an airline credit. Why would i ever want to fly delta after seeing how Delta Airlines all handled this. it’s disturbing and completely disgusting that customers are treated this way. i want to be made whole again as i deserve this is absurd and especially to deal with this while being pregnant and during the holiday Delta Airlines all have treated me horrible that luggage was an early Christmas gift from my father and now I have nothing but stress and out pocket losses for me and my father. This is wrong"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Delta Airlines On Time and Great Service,I enjoy flying Delta Airlines they have great customer services and flights are on time. I feel the airplanes are clean and the employees are very nice and professional. I enjoy watching movies and TV shows that they have to offer. I'm enrolled with the Skymiles program and I average a free flight about every three years.
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Delta Airlines Great Service,"Delta  Airlines has been the most renowned and amazing airlines across the world with which no one can compete. We will request all our customers to rely on us and our services. Spirit Airlines Phone Number 1-800-305-1533 experts will never let you down. You can call the helpline number for knowing about updated discounts, offers, flight timing changes, additional charges or extra luggage."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,On time and service was above average,Check in was easy and quick.  Flight was on time and service was above average.  Entertainment system was good.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Excellent ,"Excellent service while onboard. On time. Comfortable first class seating, blanket & pillow, headphones, amenity kit. Food was good as was service from flight attendants. Entertainment choices great. Enjoyed the ice cream sundae and warm cookie. Almost 9 hr flight easy button."
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Travel to Montreal,"When I booked these flights (co0nnecting in Detroit) I did because of the fare and times convinience. Appears as if choosing the ""basic"" rate as they classify it, one is not allowed to choose for seats, or simply there are no seats available for choosing."
Date of travel: July 2019,10,As horrible as it can be,"DO NOT FLY WITH THEM UNLESS YOU WANT TO MESS UP YOUR PLANS AND ENJOY SUFFERING. Me and my wife have finally arranged a vacation after 5 years of not being able to go anywhere. Our plan was to travel in Germany, Austria and Czech Republic within around 9 days. It was not a long vacation but it was nicely scheduled and organized by my wife. My wife was going to travel to Germany from Istanbul, Turkey and I was flying from New York, USA. My wife doesn't speak English well so we scheduled it as I would arrive Germany 2,5-3 hours before her flight arrives and I meet her right at the airport, go to the hotel, relax and get ready for our nice trip. My Delta flight to Tegel/Berlin, Germany on 7/7/2019  was supposed to take of at 8:40 pm. We got into the plane with 2 hours delay. No one was giving us proper information at all and all the answers we were receiving was ""we do not know"". Later on, we were told that the delay was caused by a maintenance issue. We boarded the plane and while thinking we will finally fly we waited in the plane for 3 hours. The pilot first told us that there are planes in front of us and we were waiting for that reason. After around 3 hours we were told that the same maintenance issue has happened again and we had to go back to the gate. While waiting there, someone from the crew announced that passengers may choose to step out of the plane while the repair is being done (I have never heard an optional leaving of the plane). 5 minutes later were were told that everybody has to leave the plane and we were all sent back to the gate. Supposedly, the original delay was because of a maintenance issue which was fixed but obviously they didn't do a good job. What if the same issue has come back during the flight? At the gate, we were first told that the repair will only take 30 minutes. When the passengers started asking what is going on after 30 minutes we started getting the ""we don't know"" answers all over again. Nobody knew what was going on and nobody cared about people's plans.I flew with several other companies including Southwest, JetBlue, Turkish Airlines, Lufthansa but whether it was a major or minor issue, delay, etc. people were informed properly and taken care of. Delta did nothing! I flew with Delta 22 years ago and it was a horrible experience. I thought things would have changed. I was right about the change part but couldn’t guess that it changed into an even worse status.  I couldn't arrive Berlin early to meet my wife so she had to go through a lot of trouble. We made a reservation for a hotel which I couldn't use. We had to reorganize everything on our itinerary since I lost 1 day. When I wrote my complaint to Delta they deposited lousy 17500 miles to my SkyMiles account saying that they already gave me a taxi voucher so that I could go home the night I could not fly. According to Delta this is a favor they have done for me. Oh btw, I am unable to use the 17500 miles they have deposited since I do not have the high level membership. I have to fly more with them to get more miles so that I can use them or have a Delta/Amex credit card. What a customer service!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Quick trip with good service,"Nice modern aircraft, good service and flight passed by quickly. Food options and wine were good. On time arrival in Dublin and immigration was very smooth early AM."
n/a,30,Delta flight 2349 & flight 2638,"Nothing bad, nothing good. Very unspectacular, things have become so mechanical and sterile. Automated safety briefing, crappy snack options. Hey Delta, not everyone likes wheat based cheese crackers! Try the originals as an option! Flight attendants really show no personal involvement anymore, they just go through the motions required of them!"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Still Good,The flight was good.  Attendants were attentive.  The only problem is the walk from the gate to the baggage claim which is unbelievably long.  It had to be at least a mile. They make you walk through the promenade with all the stores. (Leaving you are right at the gates after going through security) They need to let passengers know so they can get some kind of transportation if necessary
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Direct flight to Munich for Christmas Market,"Our flight and hotel was a great deal using Delta Vacations. Great price on the package at a very nice hotel. Out-bound was main cabin and a bit cramped, but we got an upgrade on the return that made that flight much better. Food and service on-board was very good also."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Outstanding Customer Service,Recently travel from Toronto Pearson airport to Atlanta Georgia return flight. It was our first time on Delta and there is nothing negative to say about the flights. Bestop both off and on the plane we're geared to customer service and met every requirement you could ask for in an airline. The flights were on time ordings for smooth departures were smooth and the customer service with every individual we met that worked with Delta airlines was outstanding. We would not hesitate to recommend this airline to anyone and plan on using it more in the future. It's too bad our Canadian airlines can't follow in the steps of this amazing airline.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Cruising with Delta,"Flew on Delta in order to get to Florida for a Caribbean cruise. The trip was an awesome deal as it cost us $508.00 round trip for the two of us, Spokane to Orlando. The planes were newer with monitors built into the seats in front of you. Movies, games, television shows and more included in the price of the tickets! You do need earbuds for sound and if you don't have any they can be purchased for $2.00. The snacks were great also. We had a scare on the trip home as our flight was delayed and we thought we could be stuck overnight in Minneapolis. We just made the connecting flight thanks to the pilots increasing our speed. It was an awesome trip."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Good flight,"This was an air/hotel package, and our flight was above average. The seats were wider than most, the crew was friendly, and the snacks and entertainment were good. Delta also seemed to have a more generous cancellation policy than some airlines. We were pleased with our experience."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Delta Airlines,"Delta is always my airline of choice.  They fly to almost every destination and are reliable.  I don't have an opportunity to fly as often as I used to, but when I do they are my first choice."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Great Flights,The flights we took were all on time and baggage handling was quick and without damage. I just wish they did not charge for bags .  Wish there was a bigger drink selection on board.
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Long but no problems,"We flew to Rome, Italy on Delta.  This was a nonstop flight and we were in the main cabin with an  aisle and window seat.  We were comfortable - my husband having the aisle where he can stretch was beneficial and booking seats in advance was a must.  The flight was uneventful, food ok, overhead storage good for us although we did check on the return flight without incident.  This was almost better than most of my domestic flights!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,A Miracle in the sky,"On Time. Movie options on board to keep you occupied until landing. NO COMPLICATIONS AT ALL. It's a miracle in the sky. I probably won't fly any other airline at this time. The service was fantastic and the seats were comfy. I fly in and out of Detroit metro all of the time and very impressed with DELTA. Don't forget your headphones. There are tons of movies, tv shows and music to choose from."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,I love Delta!,"Can I just say that no company is perfect, but good employees truly make a difference. Last night, I hopped on my flight to CDG. Normally, I would have watched something on the seat back screens, but against my better judgement, I popped my AirPods in so that I could watch something I downloaded on my phone. They’ve never fallen out of my ears before, so why would they now? As I’m getting nice and comfy and pulling my hair back, the left AirPod pops out and I hear a dreaded clicking noise. Right away, I knew it had become victim to my delta one seat. I looked on the floor around me. Put the seat up, put the seat down, and tried my hardest to find it without bothering anyone (since at this point all the cabin lights were dimmed). I accepted my defeat and went to sleep. A couple hours later, I woke up and started looking again really trying not to be obvious about it. Suddenly one of the flight attendants pops up and asks if I lost something. I told him that I lost my left AirPod and it’s definitely in/under the seat. He actually looked upset for me as he went to grab a flashlight. He then proceeds to take the cushion off the seat. He moves the seat up, moves it down, looks under the seat, peaks in the wiring. At this point I told him not to worry about it, that it’s honestly not worth the trouble. Insert another flight attendant asking what’s the matter. He then tells her what happened and she starts to look. I told her she really didn’t need to go through all this trouble. They then proceed to say that they can grab someone to open up the seat further when we arrive. I once again insist that it’s okay, and that it’s really not worth getting other people involved. But oh were they persistent! The male flight attendant walks off to grab something. The female flight attendant looks down into the seat one more time, reaches her hand in and says “is this it?” Hooray! She found it! I thank her and was truly grateful. The male flight attendant returns and I told him that she found the AirPod. He then says “it’s because she’s a woman and she’s got a better eye.” She then returns and says to him “you know I found it because I’m a woman right?” Commence the little giggles. Like I said, every company has it’s problems, but it’s those good employees that make the difference. I just wanted to write something because I was so impressed with their customer service and wished I could thank them again for going that extra “SkyMile.”"
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Delayed because of technical fault they should have known before boarding,"Once all passengers were sat down we were told by Captain that 'a part was missing from the tail' and that the ground crew were trying to locate a spare!. Next announcement was that we would be delayed for 2 hours so we just sat, with no further information or drinks until finally we were told that it had been fixed, but had to wait for a runway slot. We understand that certain delays are probable but surely the mechanical fault should have been seen before we boarded the aircraft. At least  the some of the lost time was rduced so landed only 1 hour after due time."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Get spoiled on Delta Transatlantic Flight ,This was my very first international flight and what a sky high experience it was ! Bravo to Delta airlines for an exceptional trans Atlantic flight !From the 1st moment and for all 10 hours of the trip  - the flight attendants spoiled us rotten ! The food - oh the  food!!! It was amazing - everything was delicious !They serve you 5-7 times with 3 meals & several drink services . Even though it was a very long trek across the pond - the great food service made it doable & helped pass the time .The movie selection was fantastic as well !
Date of travel: December 2019,20,Racist Airlines,"So, my flight left New Orleans late causing me to almost miss my connecting flight in SLC to Seattle. The flight attendant says you might make your flight you have 24 minutes mind you were in the air and still have 10 minutes till we land. You would think that the flight attendants or captain would make an announcement to the aircraft that they should let people going to Seattle or Oregon off first so they can make their flight instead since I was in the back I literally had to wait and barely made my flight. I also watched a flight attendant skip someone for a beverage then when the person asked can they get something she said I have to go in order mind you the 2 people next to the young lady got their beverages and the lady who didn’t get hers was Black and the other non black. Also my seat was so uncomfortable it was sliding off my tray was crooked causing me to not be able to put my drink on the tray and my monitor didn’t work. But wait that’s not it on Dec 13 on my way to New Orleans my sister and I was both profiled and threatened by flight attendants causing our flight to not leave on time and all of this was done in front of the whole aircraft and people were recording and witnesses said we did nothing. I was so embarrassed I cried I’ve always flown with Delta and never again I am possibly thinking of contacting an attorney I was scared because they went and got a lady from off the plane and it’s was 2 guys and 2 women’s surrounding my little sister and I and as we were in the air we were refused beverages and food treated falsely. Every flight attendant of person working for Delta that I encountered was rude and seemed like they didn’t like black people."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Delta best in USA,"Even though Delta is the best airline in the USA, its not close to some world airliners like Emirates, Qatar or Singapore. Flight crews are very friendly and do a great job. Delta could give more upgrades and benefits to Platinum level members, I fly 100k every year so I don’t quite reach the Diamond level but its still a lot and deserves more upgrades.  Delta beats the other choices in the USA and are on time."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Top Flying Experiences,"In the past year, I have flown United Airlines, Spirit, Allegiant and Delta, and Delta was by far my favorite airline. The staff was courteous. Flying international can be a hassle, but an agent helped us print out boarding passes and while checking in our bag (and didn't make a fuss or charge us when our bags were a little overweight) and then we checked in our carry-on bags for free since our first flight was booked full. (Opting to do this also let us board early.) The planes were comfortable; fortunately, there were no crying babies, the in-flight entertainment had variety. We had a short layover in Atlanta. Delta also had the best rates. I searched for months to book this trip and am very pleased with our experience overall!"
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Downgrade in service,"So, Delta does not offer blankets anymore on the long flights, at least, they told me on both long trips that I could not get a blanket.  Also, no one offered food service to purchase on both long flights.  You had to wrangle someone to order your food.  Sure, they gave snacks, but, if you wanted to order and pay for food you had to get attention yourself.  No one came around offering food service.  Bummer!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Amazing fleet,"Such an amazing airline, staff are very professional and efficient. Lots of perks especially if you are an elite member"
Date of travel: October 2019,10,Cheated out of first class,"On 10/16 my 83 year old husband and I flew from Palm Springs to San Antonio to attend a grandsons Air Force graduation.  First class wasn't the best but at least we got there.  When checking in for our return flight on 10/20 the seat assignment had changed from 2A and 2B to 19A and 19F, opposite sides of the plane.  I called the customer service line and held for over 45 minutes and was told there was no first class available.  After being on hold for quite awhile they gave us 11B and C in Economy Plus.  It was the best they could do and we took it.  The next morning at the airport the gal at check in said we had to pay for our luggage.  I told her the story and showed her our original itinerary and she did not charge us.  On Oct. 21st I followed the procedure I was told to get the refund of the price of the tickets between Economy Plus and First Class.  I have heard NOTHING since then.  I want my wasted money back.  I fly often to Bend, OR on Delta but I am going to go with another airlines in the future.  Delta needs to treat their customers better....better service with no crazy charges for what used to be included!!"
Date of travel: October 2019,10,Don't Let Delta Take Your Money: Watch the Ticket Cancellations Restrictions,"On August 2, 2019, I booked a trip with Delta in 1st class for October 1-4, 2019. A few weeks later, I had to change my plans and cancel my ticket. It happen.When I canceled my reservation, I was hit with what I thought was a pretty steep penalty, $200. I believe my only choice for the remainder was a Delta credit of $396.60. I decided to use my credit for a quick trip from LAX to SFO on 8/28/2019, but good luck locating it. Delta does not make it easy.Eventually, I started a customer service chat conversation on Delta's website. I was told I could not use my credit on the LAX – SFO flight because it was more than a year from my reservation. But it wasn’t unless you twist every date to favor Delta.They want it both ways. If the one year started on the date of my reservation of August 2, 2019, I should be able to make a reservation any time before August 2, 2020, and be within their one-year requirement.If the flight date kicks off the one year, I should be able to fly any time before 10/1/2020 and use my credit and be golden.But by telling you that you had to fly within one year of the date that you made the reservation they maximize the chance you will have to surrender your credit. While this may be legal, it’s not ethical. And it’s about as far from customer-centric thinking as I can imagine. The icing on the cake was the chat session I had with customer service (Kenneth was the bots pretend real name) who would not give me Delta’s phone number because he said, they were just going to give me the same answer as he did over chat. Basically, “Kenneth” is trying to say his decision is final. Welcome to either a Kafka novel or the Soviet Union, where low-level bureaucrats make final decisions and deny you your path to appeal. Wow."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Delta is extraordinary.  We really enjoyed flying Delta,"All was smooth.  Got to board second, after first class and hcp. Seats were comfy and there was no crowding.Plenty of room. No problems"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Another great flight,The Delta crew was great and the plane felt clean and refreshing. Departed on time and arrived on time.
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Trip to Dallas,"Very smotth flight and took shorer than announced in both ways and crew was very friendly, easy board if you pre check"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Delta Connection. Decent Flight,"Short flight in an Embraer commuter jet. The flight itself was good and fast. No onboard services as it is about an hour flight. The disappointment is on two levels. The incoming flight which became our outgoing flight was about 40 minutes late and second, the out bound flight was badly overbooked. The ground service was good, but they could have used another person at the gate."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Delta One or Delta None!,Always check your seat layout and shoot for an Airbus 330-300 (333). The pods in Delta One that are angled toward the middle offer the best amenities! Lay-flat seats let you sleep very well and I've always been a sucker for a heavy blanket (Which they provide). Great food up there also!!
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Amazing!,Our flight crew were absolutely awesome!!! They were very friendly and took very good care of us. The new Bistro menu is very nice. The food is good.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Easy peasy,This flight was in conjunction with Air France.  Service was excellent.  Boarding was a breeze.  Crew was helpful and kind.
Date of travel: December 2019,10,"Flights cancelled, my options were select another flight but not guaranteed the First Class seats I purchased with $$.","I purchased First class tickets on a flight that was to leave at 5:50 AM with an arrival time of around 12:30 PM at final destination.At around 3:00 AM I received an email the flight had been delayed. My options were to chose another flight with no guarantee of receiving the first class seats I purchased and was told if I accepted something less there would be no refund. As it turns out Delta rescheduled my wife and I but it is now leaving Ithaca at 12:25 PM, heading to Detroit, a layover then on to L.A with a layover and then to Spokane with an appropriate arrival time of 10:30 PM. I will not use Delta again unless it is the ONLY choice. At this time I know United has round trip flights from Spokane Washington to Ithaca New York. They will be my next airline for my trips to Ithaca. This airline sucks at best, use another airline if at all possible, extremely disappointed in Delta!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Flight to Amsterdam.,"The flight was in time, service was good and the food acceptable. The in flight entertainment system had a full array of options from movies, series, music and games. The system is also easy to use."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Easy flight - good service,Delta always has good service.  The plane was clean.  Flight arrived on-time.  One of many good non-stop flights between ATL and SLC.  Atlanta airport is very efficient in spite the fact that it is so large and crowded.  Our bags arrived in bag claim very quickly.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Delayed Flights Arrived on Time,"We boarded on time and were buckled in for take-off when we were informed of a flight delay because of back-ups in Atlanta. Fortunately, it is a quick trip to Atlanta where everyone had a connecting flight and everyone cooperated in disembarking the place. It was a very full flight as was my connecting flight to Newark that was also leaving late but we arrived on time in NJ. When announcing the full flight, the option to check, for no extra charge, carry-ons through to final destination was offered.

n/a,10,Worst trip home ever,"I've never really had many issues with flying Internationally for decades, aside from occasional delays. My flight home from Prague through Amsterdam to Detroit had every possible problem in 1 flight. I started receiving texts about 5 hours before my flight left Prague that my flight was delayed from 8:50 am until 11 am. 5 minutes later it was delayed until 1 pm. Then about 2 minutes later it was delayed until 11 pm, and less than a minute after that it was canceled until 1 am and within another mi ute, canceled until 6 am the next day. Delta did send a new itinerary that included my new connection in Amsterdam. I arrived at the Prague airport and the Delta partner check in KLM. For some reason I was not able to check in online. When I made it thru the line because my business class seat had been switched to economy. It appeared that Delta issued a new itinerary but not a new ticket. I was told to step out of the long line and call Delta myself. I was visibly upset so the supervisor came over to reiterate that I needed to leave the line and call Delta on my own. I did and within a minute my tickets were issued. The next customer check in clerk said that they would have to handwrite a checked bag label. I got on my plane and there were 7 empty business class seats on the flight. I was still forced to sit in my economy seat even though I bought a business class ticket. In Amsterdam we were on time but something was strange. The entire Delta One section was filled and the rest of the giant seat had only 8 people I. It. There were over 250 empty seats. Yet they still ran out of the Caesar Salad immediately. I got home and it was great until I went to get my bag. Alas it was no where to be found. I arrived a day late and my luggage a day after me. At first Delta was uncooperative with my complaints, but I did get a timely refund of expenses and a bit of money for my troubles. I'm now very anxious for my next trip in two weeks to Italy."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,"Smooth, efficient travel even on the Sunday of Thanksgiving Weekend (maybe the busiest flying day of the year).","Smooth pair of flights (well, turbulance from Nature but not the Airline). Despite the very busy travel day, smooth checkin from the early morning station crew in Norfolk. Gate crews in Norfolk and Atlanta were good.  Flight crews on both legs (ORF-ATL, and ATL-MCO) were good, friendly, professional.  Nice experience."

I am rewarded with Elite status, which makes flying so much easier, but I earned it."

Date of travel: May 2019,50,Great Fist Class Traveling Airline,"We are DeltaSky  members and we Fly Delta to Europe for our River Cruise . The Plane was a wide Body 777 and the crew was absolutely fantastic . The service was inpecible from the food service to setting up our beds .If traveling  more than for hours , we highly recomend fling first class and Delta is definitely our choice ."
n/a,20,"If only the crew was welcoming, polite and professional ","Flew Delta from Detroit to NRT, Tokyo for the first time on Airbus 380. From the baggage check-in process, to boarding and then the inflight crew, the entire experience left a lot to be desired. Never felt welcomed or even acknowledged as a passenger on board. Boarding process was fast and streamlined. Food was average, and drink choices were bottom-shelf.Restroom were claustrophobic compared to Dreamliner. After the meal service, the crew was barely to be seen on the floor, or attending to any needs passengers may have. A couple of crew members were in the back of the craft, seen playing on their phones. The rest were happily snoozing. There were some unhealthy snacks in the back of craft i.e.  the self-serve area. The US based crew was quite arrogant and not careful when moving their service cart. They would disrespectfully barrel down the aisles hitting hands and shoulders. Very unsafe.Very loud, ill-mannered cocky crew. Request for a cup of water would result in the following response: cups and water are in the back of the craft. Will definitely avoid Delta (United, American) for my International flights. Cathay Pacific, Air New Zealand, virgin Australia, Emirates, ANA, Qatar, Etihad, Singapore Air...are excellent first choices. Thanks ANA staff"
Date of travel: October 2019,10,They should have notified us!,"We love the direct flight from Portland OR. to Amsterdam. The attendants were actually the best we have ever had on our last flight. Extremely nice and genuinely concerned with our comfort and experience. The only reason for my bad rating on this flight is that the airline did not notify us that a passenger with the measles was on our flight. I feel that the airline should have notified us immediately upon the discovery of this fact. We found out on the news a few days after landing. Then the county called us two weeks later, practically at the end of any chance of us getting sick if we weren't immune. I would have loved a call immediately after discovery by Delta. No one in my party got sick but others did. I can tell that Delta is trying to improve the quality and experience of their flights and I appreciate that. On this flight, they served us complimentary bellinis and that was very nice."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Wish I Could Predict Weather,"Set up a business trip in September with the thought that it COULD be snowing in Boston when I had to go. I had to go and yep, it did snow, but Boston Logan is used to that and has the equipment to keep the planes coming and going!  Delta was GREAT for keeping passengers up to date on conditions. It was a 1-1/2 hours delay in Atlanta, but arrived in Boston for a next day business engagement. Had to drive 60 miles to Warwick, RI - in the snow - that took about 2 hours.  The return flight was late morning, but asked for an earlier flight at the gate. Delta came through, again! I was standby on a 7:00 AM flight, had a seat, and got home 3+ hours early. Delta was GREAT again.  Headed back to Boston in January (2020). Not hoping for snow, but know that Delta has my back!  Delta is First Class!"
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Has MSNBC Been Banned From Delta Inflight Programs?,"On a recent Delta flight from Atlanta to Newark I discovered that my inflight Dish options included FOX and FOX NEWS but not MSNBC. Very frustrating!I have no problem if some customers want to watch FOX NEWS. But millions consider FOX NEWS a Trump propaganda channel and want to watch Rachel Maddie, Chris Matthews, Brian Williams—all highly rated cable shows."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Delta Delivered,"It is worth the extra money to fly Delta comfofrt.  The legroom is much betterif you are tall.  The service is always good in any class of service.

I managedto misplace that information."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Quick Birthday Getaway,We cashed in some miles to fly out to San Francisco for a weekend. I tried to upgrade our seats online as there were several empty exit row seats but could not. I asked the flight attendant when we boarded and she was cool with letting us move. Nice to have a bit of space and be closer to the front. I have a Delta AMEX but still have to pay for certain upgrades. Did purchase a sandwich on this flight. It was good but would have been better if it was warmed?

Date of travel: November 2019,50,Well above the others,"Delta's commitment to improved service is readily apparent in both directions of these ATL-SCL-ATL flights.  Food was excellent and service attentive.  While the other US legacy carriers continue to be the same old, same old, Delta has improved markedly.  I"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Good for short flight!,"For a short flight, this was surprisingly pleasant.  Boarding was smooth and the flight attendants were pleasant enough.  The new plane (717-200) was clean and comfortable.  Passengers were even given soft drinks and Cheez-its!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,They say once you fly First Class...they were right!,"Yes: it was First Class. So why write a review? Well, you can pay for First Class and have expectations, and maybe not experience your expectations. I've actually flown on First Class or Business Class before, and not had the level of service I found on Delta One. Everything you think and expect about first class is there. But Delta flight attendants exceeded my expectations: they were so experienced, so on their game, they knew what I wanted before I wanted it. And they knew to let me sleep if I wanted to sleep. Pretty cool and worth every penny."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Enjoyable Trip,I recently flew Delta to Mexico City before taking a connecting flight on AeroMexico. The staff did an excellent job and the flight was enjoyable. I'm glad I chose Delta.
n/a,50,Layover in Atlanta,"At first I was really upset because Delta had changed my flight schedule without ever informing me. I noticed it a week before I was to fly & called - in the long run I ended up with better flights than I had initially booked.  Food from Atlanta to Bogota was good. I did find it funny that on a flight to Colombia the tv selection included shows called Narcos Wars & another show called The Rise & Fall of Pablo Escobar. I have had bad experiences on delta in the past, but this flight went really well, was on time & services were good, seats comfortable."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,"Awful flight, Awful Service.  Do NOT FLY!","I recently flew on this flight and it was a dreadful nightmare.  The attendants were rude, impolite, uncooperative, and not helpful.  They refused to upgrade us to Comfort +, and the plane was tired and old.  I was disappointed in what they call “the number one airline in DTW”.  I would one hundred percent NOT recommend this flight, and it ruined the Delta experience, as before this, we flew Delta frequently and enjoyed it. Once again DO NOT fly Delta."
Date of travel: November 2019,30,"Unfriendly Staff, dirty plane","The staff that served our cabin after row 20 was so rude. Our flight was 9 hours returning starting at 11:30 am. Our seats were dirty from the previous trip and requesting anything from the flight attendance was an inconvenience. I think Delta is one of the only airlines out there that offer good amenities in terms of entertaining and refreshment, however this trip was awful, it seems that during this trip they have run out of everything inclusive of any food in their ""offer menu"" I could eat due to nuts allergies. The flight attendant was so rude, and remind me that I could opt not to eat. Wow, thanks for the advice. For the second meal, the same happened.  Next time, I will prepare better with my own food."
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Delta DFW to Rome,"The staff were friendly, the amenities like snacks and drinks were adequate, but the seating and leg space was limited for tall people. In addition, I did not have sound for my entertaining system, so I was without entertaining during our 7 hours flight."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Great flight,"This was the first time I have flown on a Delta flight. Everything was great, and it was well worth a little extra money to sit in Premium economy for the extra leg room!  All of my family is tall and it was a long flight, but very comfortable, the flight attendants were kind and helpful. Couldn't have asked for a better experience on a long flight!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Lone day of travel,"Delta once again has earned high marks from us. Before our flight Delta needed 12 people to give up their seats and take a later flight. My husband and I are retired so we took them up on their offer. After the original flight departed the ticket agent booked us on another flight getting in the same day as the original one, gave us vouchers for breakfast and then gave us a VERY generous cash offer which we also accepted. I wish I had gotten his name so Delta could recognize his efforts. My review is not based on the incentive but rather the agent who had his hands full with the rebookings,  the Christmas crowd and the unhappy folks who were not able to get on the original flight."
Date of travel: October 2019,10,Miserable time,"The whole experience was junk, the seat selector showed a seat with improved leg room (I'm 6'2"") and not only was it not a leg room seat, the seat didn't recline.  On the trip home, same thing.   I sat on on exit row, there was no seat beside me, so the man sitting to my right and rear decided to take off his shoes and spend the six hour flight blessing me with the cheesy funk of his feet.  The ear buds they issued were CRAP, so I watched TV with no sound.  It was better that way than using the earbuds.  I tried to upgrade to a better class for the trip home and the woman at the counter was horribly rude.  There were literally 20 seats available in First Class and whatever they call the improved economy, but she was acting like her job was too hard for her that day, and I was the least of her worries.  Maybe I was, the least of her worries."

Date of travel: November 2019,20,Air Travel in America Continues to Decline,"I travel all over the world and I must say travel in the USA is getting worse and worse. When I booked the ticket, it never said I must upgrade to a more expensive ticket in order to sit together with my partner. We both got middle seats 10 rows apart. The price was about what one should expect for Economy Premium. At least they did not charge us for carry-ons. I'm not picking on Delta - many airlines in America are now doing this. At least with the low budget airlines you can buy seats together. We couldn't even do that."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Excellent personal service,"We had a great flight - on time - luggage arrived safely.  Thought the bellinis were a special treat.  Our flight attendant called everyone by name.  The only negative is that it was very cold.  They attempted to remedy it, and it helped slightly."
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Paid 3000 Miles to upgrade?,"The night before my flight, I received an email reminder to check-in.  I went to the app and Delta offered me what I thought to be an upgrade to their Comfort Plus for $30 or 3000 miles.  I paid the 3000 miles.  When I got on the flight I was surprised to find out I was not in Comfort Plus but the first row behind.  They charged me 3000 miles for the same seat 3 rows up.  I was going to call and get the miles refunded but their miles aren't worth my time."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Transatlantic Flight to Madrid,"Had a good experience on a recent flight from JFK to Madrid.  This flight was my first flight since Delta upgraded their service on international economy and there were noticeable changes. My economy seat on the 767-300er was what I expected with decent IFE containing a wide selection of movies.  Pillows, blankets, and a sleep kit were given to all passengers.  The biggest change was in the dining experience.  We were each offered bottles of water, a cocktail, and placemats.  Menus were given with a choice of appetizer and main course which both tasted reasonably well.  Dinner was followed by ice cream.  Mid-flight, the galley had snacks and water available for us to grab.  Prior to landing we were given a hot cinnamon roll and finally a piece of chocolate.  Overall this was a nice upgrade over the usual economy dining experience.  The only drawback was it seemed to take a long time to serve everybody before turning the lights off for us to sleep on this red-eye flight.Overall was a good experience and I like the new upgrades in service."

Date of travel: December 2019,20,Gate Agent lied to boarding passengers about carry on space.,"Flying Sarasota to Atlanta 12/12 -  3:09 pm Gate Agent told a number of people that ""Overhead was totally full and everyone would have to check their carry-on roller bags.""Sitting in a ""Aft"" Row we passed at least a dozen places roller bags would have fit and plane was mostly already boarded.This Jet had exceptionally large overhead bins as well.When I complained to the flight attendant he said the Gate Agents ""counted"" what was loading??  If so - they need math classes.I don't buy it - they wanted to speed up boarding which probably affects their performance reviews. It also prevents them from having to manage the boarding process for customers with baggage- some of who carry baggage they are unable to handle- they should be the ones who are forced to check bags.Very poorly handled- especially lying to customers thinking they wouldn't notice all the empty overhead space. Through out this flight the overhead bin directly over our seats remained empty -as were others at the end of the flight.This bin alone could have held 3 roller bags.Airlines need to number the bins to match the seat number- if it fits it flies- otherwise it gets checked. This would keep people from carrying more than their share of bags.I hope other flyers who see this happening call out the airlines for this deceptive behavior."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Flying Coach on a long flight,Delta is great.  The flight attendance are the best.  Ours recommeded his favorite coach dinner and it was great.  We flew thru Paris going and JFK coming home.  The Tel Aviv to JFK flight was over 12 hours and sitting in a coach seat for that long was extremely uncomfortable.  It is just way too expensive to fly business class.  The Bathrooms on the JFK fight became gross as the trip progressed and no effort seemed to be made to clean them.  I had to wipe up around the place each time I went in.  Someone should be assigned to do this.
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Good flight,"Very nice flight. Flight attendants were accommodating, friendly and quite professional. I just don't understand why there is no food served on such a long flight. They offered pillows and blankets which was nice, but no food.  Good TV choices and movies as well. Bathrooms and plane were clean.  Safe flight and a good experience.  Delta is always professional and good staff.  Seats were comfortable as well."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Quebec to KC,"Flight was excellent, On time both on take-off and arrival to Chicago.  We had 1-1/2 hours to change planes in Chicago. BRUTAL. going through customs, and going from one terminal to another, AND then having to check in through security again was a nightmare.  We walked ( almost ran) to reach our connecting flight.  Barely made it.  Another couple on the same itenary MISSED their flight.  Nothing wrong with Delta, BUT if you can avoid Chicago O'Hare from international to Domestic, DO IT!!!!!!!!!"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Unexpected improvement with in flight catering,"This lengthy flight was improved by the unexpected quality of the in flight catering and beverages. The welcome cocktail before the main meal was a Peach Bellini. There was a choice of two starters and a choice of 3 main courses. Likewise there was an option of 2 Pizza Twists served about an hour before landing. In flight staff were friendly and attentive. There were also lots of movies to choose from. This flight passed quickly, always a good sign."

Date of travel: November 2019,50,Excellent Flight from City Where I Live to NYC,"I have always been well treated by Delta so I fly them exclusively (except once when they didn't fly to a city I needed to go to for a wedding). Recently, I was flying from Fort Myers to New York City to visit my elderly parents. The flight was the first flight out of my home airport and flew non-stop to my destination. I received a text the night before that the flight would be departing a little late, so I didn't have to leave for the airport at the time I would have. There was bad weather in the plane's previous arrival city; thus, we had to wait for it to arrive in Fort Myers. However, everyone boarded quickly and we still made it almost the same arrival time as scheduled. The flight crew was very cordial, apologized for the delay (which was minimal), and we had a great flight in every way! I love Delta!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,South Atlanta's Own Airline,"I love that this Flight had comfortable seating, flexibility, cleanliness, and an in-flight movie options. Win, win!I was a little disappointed in the snack options.I think they should have some Non-Gmo options.Some of the flight attendants didn't seem very happy about doing their job though. It was clear that they were not use to serving people of different ethnicities, which is ironic, since they were working an International Flight.I was impressed with the friendliness of the flight attendants and airport personnel in Honduras, for my return flight to Atlanta.  They were much more eager to help and friendlier."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Vacation saved!,"Brad at Delta’s Special Services and Renée with Delta’s help line worked a miracle to save our trip. A friend and I had arrived much too late to make a non-stop flight to Cancún with the rest of our group and we had the good fortune to be Brad’s next-in-line. While Renée spoke with our travel agent to work around/with Delta Vacations, Brad and his expertise were able to navigate fully-booked flights and get us actually confirmed on a flight through Atlanta to arrive same day. Both out well over an hour into making sure we made it, and I can’t explain how impossible the situation was. I’m so grateful to Brad and Renée to have made it to Cancún. It was the best time!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Your On Time Airline,"Whether for business or leisure keeping to the schedule is important to all.  With the holidays here making that connection is just as important as the business person making that connection.  Delta claims to be America's Number 1 on time airline.  Easy to say, hard to make happen which is what Delta does over and over again as represented on this flight to Atlanta from Dallas.  The flight attendants kept the loading process moving forward by assisting where needed, the pilots confirmed safely keeping to the schedule was important with timely and accurate communication.  The end result was the flight kept to the schedule, everyone made their connection and Delta help make the world a little bit closer which they also often say.  HAPPY HOLIDAYS!"

Date of travel: July 2019,50,Our Airline to fly,"We have been flying Delta for years and flying them internationally is even better. Based in Atlanta, it is our usual airline but with so many other airlines now flying into and out of Atlanta we do have other choices. But we have not had any bad experiences with Delta so Delta is our Airline."
Date of travel: October 2019,30,KNOW THIS BEFORE BOOKING A FLIGHT,"Be careful when you book a flight with any Airline  for a non refundable ticket.  It is best to book through the Airlines, not Travelocity,Expedia, Priceline, erc if you have change your plans.Travolocity had a better price when we booked a flight, when an emergency came up that we had to change flights They told us to call the airlines, and the airlines said you have to work with who book your flights. After more phone calls, Delta Customer Service worked with us and after checking our story, instead of losing the cost of the flight, they gve us a credit for the amount minus $110 to be used withiin a year on anoher Delta flight..  I would imagine the other airlines are similiar in deaing with cancelations, so check before you book. Flight insurance is a good idea if the cost reasonable."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Only direct flight,Delta is only airline with direct flight to Bonaire that flies within 2 hrs drive of home.  The only problem is that it flies only once on Saturdays/week.  Sometime they add a second flight per week but since we have to book the apartment we stay in 2 years in advance we can’t wait to see if there will be any additional flights/week.  We enjoy flying Delta and like being able to unload off the back and front of plane in Bonaire.  Very friendly staff on planes and at counters

Each time making the flight eariler and eariler, now they have us leaving at 3:20 am! when the flight we booked was to leave at 10:30 am. No reduction in price, no booking us on another flight, no up grade to first class, no credit towards another flight, no concideration of any kind, Delta doesn't care that we contracted with them 10 months eariler for the flights and that they have violated our contract. They do not give a crap about their customers."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Bad service,"If I were allowed to give zero ratings I would. This is a terrible airline. They allow unlimited numbers of carry-on. Because of this the overhead space fills immediately as the boarding begins. Then one is forced to put their carry-on on the floor. No space for legs. In addition to that they damaged my checked-in bag. Since I did not report it within 24 hrs the refused to take responsibility. After an exhausting trip and busy schedule the next day, how am I supposed to report it. It is not the only thing I do in my life. I will never, ever fly Delta."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Quick Check In & On time,"The non-stops are always the best and Delta has so many to so many destinations. We flew economy comfort out and First Class back. Both are good and roomy. One doesn't get many amenities on any airline, these days!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great trip ,Started in Portland and had a lay over in Salt Lake City. Both flights took off on time and landed early. Flight attendants were kind and smiley.

n/a,50,Could not fault,Was running late due to awful customs at atlanta airport so thought we were going miss our connecting flight. As we arrived the staff were fantastic and offered complementary drinks as they could see we had been running to get the flight. They plane was very comfortable a d the staff were fantastic. Lots of space and fantastic entertainment system. Will defo be flying with them again
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great flight,The flight was great.  The flight attendants were very attentive  it was one of my first time flying and it was great. Thank you to pilots and staff for my safe and wonderful flight
Date of travel: June 2019,50,Upgraded to 1st Class for $12 !!!,"Due to total back reconstruction and fused cervical spine, traveling is very challenging.  WE decided to check 1st class availability due to the length of the flight.  Their ""call back service"" is outstanding and the administrative person who called me was wonderful.  She kept checking what fees could be waived for the ""change"" in ticket and then called the HELP desk when the charge would not go through.  By the end of the call, we had gone from $400+ to $12 for the two of us!!"
Date of travel: September 2019,40,No problem,We had no problem flying with Delta and will continue to fly this airline since it is the most convenient from Salt Lake City
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Best of the bigs,"Newer plane Free movies on back of seat in front , new releases, great selection Ultra comfortable seats with roomFriendly professional attendants Most enjoyable flight I have had in 20 years I will pay extra in the future to fly Delta Flight from Atlanta to Manchester NH was just as enjoyable I had the ultra economy least expensive seats available through Priceline"
Date of travel: August 2019,40,Delta the power horse on the move,"We flew out of SFO under cover of darkness. Now I will admit I haven't flown in 20 years, so the numbers that identify the plane type confused me a little. The first leg of our trip was from San Francisco to Atlanta International Airport or ATL. Which by th way is a hub for Delta Airlines. As our plane touched down in the great state of Georgia, all you could see were Delta Jets, they were everywhere. This Airport is outstanding but we leave that for another review. We had a lay over that lasted just over 3 hours. Then we boarded a Delta Boeing 757. Why did I think a 757 was bigger than a 747? The numbers are higher, but the plane was small, lol. Service on board every leg of our trip to and from Aruba was top! The flight attendants all were very polite and professional. But my only issue is that we should have booked first class instead of economy! In economy the seats are way to close together, if your height is north of 5'10 and you have long legs? You need to book 1st Class. Much more leg and elbow room. Just imagine a 6 hour flight and every time you move an inch your bumping up against the passenger seated next to you, don't sit next to the window if you like to drink a lot of soft drinks, because when you have to pee, the whole row needs to get up! I drank water and ate 10 bags of Cheez -it's. 1st Class gets hot food that has been prepared, and yes they eat first! My stomach was growling for a tiny bag of pretzels or cheez-it's.Now i'm addicted to them. haha Hey Airline officials? We are not cattle! I will never fly economy again... it can be brutal,1st Class, unless you don't mind the chair in front of you pressing into your knees for 5-6 hours."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Downgraded to coach from first class,"I arrived on time from LHR for a connecting flight from JFK to LAX. I was informed by Virgin Atlantic that my connecting is on Terminal 4 and  I won’t need to change terminals. I had to take my bags from the carousel and had to hand them over to Delta’s baggage services. I asked the lady at the delta reception if she can change my boarding pass since it didn’t say TSA pre check on it. She declined saying it was Virgin who issued it. She also told me that my flight is leaving soon in terminal 2 so I better hurry up. I rode the tram to terminal 2, only to find out that my aircraft is leaving from terminal 4 where I originally was. The gentlemen from delta politely changed my boarding card with a TSA pre check so that it will be quicker for me to queue. He is the only reason I am giving this a one star. Obviously, I missed the flight. My flight leaves at 16:55 and I arrived at the door at 16:48, and I know this time the door of the aircraft is already closed. I was directed to gate 31 to have my ticket rebooked. I was glad that they did for the 18:00 flight, but when I reached gate 36, I found out that my seat is on the main coach, and it’s a window seat. My first class ticket just became an economy seat with no perks at all. I asked the gentleman at 36b and he informed me that they don’t have a seat available. It’s a courtesy that they booked me because I missed my connecting flight despite informing him that I was given the wrong information, otherwise, I wouldn’t have missed it. I begged, as in begged for an aisle seat anywhere in the cabin and I have a medical condition that requires me to stand up every now and then, but he said that there was none and to swap a seat with the person seating next to me. I asked for the next flight and I won’t mind waiting. He said there’s none as well. He said I can pay if I want to go back to first class for $1700 since I am not an “executive member of Delta”. I explained to him that I am a silver member of Virgin, and it may not be much for a membership compared to other frequent flyers, but I also paid for the full price of my entire journey, all as first class seats. I contacted Delta and they informed me that they only communicate via twitter messages or Facebook and don’t reply via email. So I thought to share my experience online. Delta has poor service recovery and didn’t take accountability that I was provided the wrong terminal, declined a TSA pre checked boarding pass which escalated everything. Instead, the answer I got was “contact Virgin Atlantic for monetary refund.” I wasn’t asking for one. All I was asking is for me to understand why I was downgraded to economy from a first class seat. I’m not that tall, I am just 5’11” but being cramped in a window seat didn’t help at all, which irritated the woman sitting next to me because I stood up 4x in the 5 hour or so flight. If I were in first class, the ratio between passengers and the toilets are way less, and I would be able to stand up without disturbing anyone."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,The airlines have you by the betzem...,Plane was a 737-900 (I think).  The flight was on time... but the in-flight entertainment was broken.  4.25 hours of playing solitaire.  Boring.  Food was uninspiring.  Snacks were okay.  Fresca was great.  Service very good.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Comfort,The flight went smoothly and the staff was friendly. The restroom was ridiculously small. Not offering free we-fi is petty. It would make more sense for people who sit in the rear of the plane to get onboard first
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Boston Bound,"I had a smooth flight, everyone was helpful. I had a quick turn around, my bags made it fine. As usual I recommend flying Delta Airlines."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Better,"Delta is better than any other America flights in the USA. Fly from Paris even better. Service is better, food is better, more movies to choose to watch."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Smooth trip,Smooth trip and my luggage made all the trips. On time and the flight from Atlanta to Fort Walton Beach was smooth smooth Smooth.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Thanksgiving Family Reunion,Enjoyable and very smooth flight.  Take off and landing were great!  Service was good and flight attendants were helpful.
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Great food and drink,The food is as good on Delta's inbound flights as it is on the outbound.  I have flown twice to and from Europe with Delta and twice with Al Italia; I can't say that to be so on Al Italia. The inflight movie options were great on Delta.  The seats in coach are wider. The one thing Delta could improve on is the configuration of the first class seat for lying down.  The area for the feet is too narrow.
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Would not recommend,"Seat uncomfortable but ok/normal if you are used to travel a lot. Stewards not helpful at all and in my opinion rude, food  equal to zero on a 6 hour flight. You get only a snack and if you want to buy something they don’t have it. So better bring some food with you if you are arriving hungry from another long flight from Europe. I also got sick for the very low temperature in the airplane even if covered with all the clothes and blanket I got. I would not recommend to any of my friends and I will try to avoid it as much as possible. Would use it only if there is really no other option."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Great Round Trip to China,"VERY impressed with the quality of seat comfort, service, and in-flight entertainment.  On a 14 hour flight, these are all very important and Delta outdid themselves in my opinion."
Date of travel: September 2019,30,Pros & Cons,"We fly frequently from the US to Portugal because we have a house in Portugal. Most of the time we fly out of JFK  because of the prices. The JFK Delta lounge has been undergoing renovation for what seems like years. It is still undergoing renovation and service can be sparse. And what is up with millions of dollars of renovation that results in only 2 small TV's above the bar that can hardly be seen from 10 feet away??? Half the lounge wanted to see the football game and it was impossible. And there was no food because the kitchen is under renovation. And on to the flight. We boarded & taxied out, then taxied back, taxied out and taxied back. Then we unloaded and waited, and waited, and waited. It was after midnight so everything was closed. No place to get food or drink. Delta brought out a tray of about 100 small waters for 200 plus people. We finally took off 4 1/2 hours late. Finally, on the plane, I have to say we had excellent flight attendants. The plane had fairly comfortable seats and there was actually a movie that I wanted to see. This is off-center for flights that I usually experience. It was a good flight, good food, adequate movies and excellent flight attendants."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Mrs,My flight from Texas to NY was great I enjoyed the in flight movies and sitcoms... The service was great
Date of travel: December 2019,40,LA to Orlando on Delta,"The in flight entertainment was great. Don’t forget your own earphones. Some simple complimentary snacks (biscuits and water) were supplied , everything else you need to purchase but was actually cheaper than food at the terminal."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Good experience for a short flight,It was a short 2 hour flight.  The flight attendants were nice and always had a smile.  We did not experience any issues or concerns during our flight. It was a small plane so there wasn't a lot of room and getting to the seats while on-boarding was a little hard but not impossible.
Date of travel: November 2019,10,"appaling, will never fly with them again","The whole experience  was appalling, felt like we were in the way,didn't get offered any drinks, had to ask. It was a late flight but we were still served food or should i say thrown food."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Delta Airlines still going a great job,"Love being able to fly out of local airport in Melbourne ,No hassels of Orlando long lines hectic crowds ,TSA precheck passengers not having a clue what to do, strollers,Disney characters ect.ect.Quick easy service arrived 1 hour prior to flight quick easy coutious check in ,easy fast TSA check in, Organized boarding process,Flight attendends smiling ,helpful,friendly ,Captaing greeting you at door upon exit,Planes up to date,wi-fi,personal entertainment systems on the back of each seat with a great varity of viewing, Movies, TV,Music,Games .Grat selection of food for purcahse,fresh and helthy choices. Delta still doing a great job at being number 1 in air travel......"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great Flight,"Our trip on Delta was very nice.  I was a first time flyer, so had a lot of apprehension, but it was a great flight.  The attendants were very kind and polite and took care of our needs and the pilot kept us informed of impending turbulence.  The seats were comfortable.  I would defiitely fly with them again."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Pleasant flight,"Traveled in Comfort Plus section, with extra pitch to stretch legs, in my reserved seat. It was a 605AM flight, so a complimentary decent breakfast was served. I chose a bagel sandwich. Some other snack was also offered later. Flt Attendant Kathryn was pleasant and professional. The flight was on time.Don't believe that there was in-flight entertainment. (Took three flights in five days and don't remember. Definitely had it on American Airlines DCA-LAX.) The Comfort Plus seat might not make much of a difference in a middle seat, but in an aisle or window it really makes a difference.Delta airport staff were all good, but TSA personnel had a generally hostile attitude towards everyone, despite polite travelers."
n/a,20,Wheelchair Disaster ,"On December 4th, 2019 Flight Number DL843 arrived from ATL to JFK at 114pm. We had to wait 30 minutes for our previously scheduled wheelchair to arrive. On November 27, 2019 we were taken to the wrong gate for Flight Number DL870. I am very dissatisfied with Delta Airlines."
n/a,50,Peacefulness ,Staying at Hale Koa Hotel was a wonderful  decision on my part. I had an absolute ball while off the mainland. The people were amazingly friendly and the outlets were great. The room service was nice and I  was extremely impressed with the wait staff.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Always On time,"Very nice flight, the best thing when you flight is when everything is on time, Delta is the best in entertainment"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great Flight!,"I want to thank Katie and Mary for the great flight experience they provided. I travel a lot and I have never had such great service from any other airline. Katie and Mary are two upbeat, positive and helpful flight attendants.The best I have ever seen. I'ts the people who work for you that create the experience not the airplane. Because of Katie and Mary I will always make Delta my 1st choice."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Saint Maarten trip,"Overall a wonderful flight. Seats were better than expected comfort wise. It left a little bit late but I think they made the time up in the air. One negative was trying to purchase breakfast, they ran out of items before they got through the cabin. Overall a very good experience."
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Typical flight,"Flight was on time, and booked solid. Too many people with carry-on bags, cramped seating, mercifully short flight time. No better or worse than riding a passenger bus."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Delta to San Jose and Miami,Both Flights surrounded a Cruise with Regent..Good service and nothing out of place to report.My wife and I primarily fly Delta because it is the Hub in Minneapolis.
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Could learn some tips from Virgin its partner,"There was confusion at the start going to the wrong terminal (E) Virgin Atlantic who we had flown out with, when it should have been  terminal (A) Delta, the problem is Virgin & Delta are now partners but at Boston don't share the same building unlike at Heathrow. The flight was okay just over five hours to get back but the inflight food was nothing to shout about & one of the air stewardess was quite rude when I asked about having a G & T two hours into the flight she said there wasn't any left, oh well your know for next time she said."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,❤️ Delta Comfort,"I love traveling Delta Comfort. It is enough of an upgrade from economy to keep me from feeling like cattle, the extra room and service is great for me and my flight is always fun and comfortable ... not to mention, I love curling up with the on- board entertainment system!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Handy Connecting Point,"I find Amsterdam Schipol Airport one of the easiest to navigate when making connecfions.  I've used it for that purpose many times with the final destinations including Strasbourg, Bucharest and Malta.  Delta with its partnership with Air France and KLM keeps things simple.  (BTW, my unfavorite airport for making connections is DeGaulle.  It is fine for arrivals and departures but for connections a major pain.)"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,"The cleanest, most comfortable in the business. Friendly helpful attendants that care about what they do!!","The best Airline in the industry...bar none!!! Delta provides the best overall service for Domestic and International travel.  If I have a choice it's going to be Delta.       Clean planes, best attendants, best overall service; period."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Change of flight,"Our Virgin flight was cancelled and we were put onto a Delta flight in Delta One class.  It was absolutely amazing, completely up to date with your own cubicle, with a door to prevent you being disturbed.  The quality of the TV was excellent and the staff were very friendly.  I now prefer Delta first class to Virgin Upper Class."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Fantastic Service,I had the best experience on flight from new York to Dublin on sat 7th Dec 2019 . Service was amazing and so was the food . Couldn't fault anything .
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Till next time!,I really liked flying with Delta compared to the other carriers I used for the Domestic flights.The crew was lovely and so was the service.The seats were comfortable too.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Smooth ride,"Smooth ride! Great landing! Good flight service and spacious room on airbus jet! Customer service representative, she was super friendly and patient because I had a two year old! I forgot her name, she was Hispanic and middle aged and she worked the special needs line that day on December 10, 2019! Would love to give her cuddos! Appreciate service like that, makes you want to travel again! Captain was also experienced! Thank you"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Very impressed with customer service and online app,"I have flown nothing but Alaska for the last decade. Booked a cruise that put us on Delta. I was so surprised how impressed we were. Great customer service, love the app, friendly check in, good food, comfortable seats.  Had a great flight, even had an App feature that told me when my luggage was loaded on board, and taken off.  Great flight."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Back Home,"We did have a slight delay due to a light malfunction but it was dealt with and we were informed every step of the way.  GREAT flight attendant who was attentive, patient and gracious.  I sat in the back of the plane and she did a great job.  I am (in general) annoyed at most of the airlines for all of the hoopla of not being able to be guaranteed seats if you pay the lower price."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Delta and Bermuda were made for eachother,Great staff and comfy leg room. super short flight and  quick exit off flight .Friendly greeting at the tiny airport and smiling faces every where.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,A flight to brag on,"I've always been nervous about flying but with my daughter living in K-town Germany, I knew I needed to see her. And the only watch to do it would be to fly. We left Atlanta on a Friday around 6pm and arrived in Frankfurt at 8am. The flight was smooth and the service we received was the top of the line. The dinner meal was better then some served in many restaurants. Our flight back, 10 days later, was just as great. If you have to fly, I would highly recommend Fly Delta!"
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Would be my top choice if price is competitive,"Delta would be my first choice from Seattle to Orange County when their price is competitive with Jetblue or Alaska. Better service, better plane. It felt more comfortable to travel with these guys. Their App does its job, but with delays, I'd recommend to call customer rep, quicker response and changes."
Date of travel: May 2019,40,"Detroit to Beacon, NY","Delta flies several flights a day that run less than an hour and a half and I buy tickets directly from Delta. The planes are small and the bathrooms are very tight. There is not much space for carry-ons, but gate checks are very fast. All told, this is a convenient flight to up the Hudson from Detroit."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,weekend trip,"good service, as usual did not leave mobile on time. However, got to atlanta on time. otherwise a pleasure to fly."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great airline (I'll miss it),My first trip (years ago) was with Delta and I enjoyed it: great quality and great value. The last one (last month) was also with them and the service was still great.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,I Love Flying Delta Airline,"The flight from Orlando to Atlanta was smooth and without incident.  Check-in at  the Delta kiosk was quick and easy; the kiosk was modern, clean, bright screen and the process was fast.  The boarding process was quick and the pre-boarding announcements made for smooth boarding.  I am not sure what happened after I boarded the flight. My tray table was free of dirt and stains and my window seat was comfortable; a big plus for Delta. The front economy class bathroom needed some air freshener.After landing and making it to baggage claim, the monitor listed bags from Orlando were expected in 12 minutes.  My bag was already on the belt.  The best part of the flight is not waiting on bags after landing.  You rock Delta."
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Not The Best,"The first leg of the trip from Atlanta to Quito was fine. The problem developed before even before we left the airport. Though we were holding first class tickets we were denied access to the Delta Sky Club for reasons were still are not completely sure about. The trip it self was fine except that the seats we were in would not recline. The flight crew was attentive and the lead stewardess did the best job ever of making the flight instructions both informative and humorous. The return flight had a major problem. It left at 12:40am. During the flight there was a mechanical failure (or near failure?) that raised questions as to the ability to complete the flight, so the Captain decided to divert the flight to Panama City. We sat on the ground on the plane for 3 hours while they determined if the problem could be fixed. They finally left us off the plane when it was decided to order another plane. It was suppose to arrive at 12:30pm but did not arrive until 2:30pm. The airline provided vouchers for $20 for meals during our stay on the ground about 8 hours. We finally arrived in Atlanta. Using the Delta app we tried to track our luggage. We waited for 20 or 30 minutes at the baggage claim for the luggage. The app reported that our luggage was still in customs. Just by chance we discovered that it had arrived sometime before we got to the baggage claim and was sitting off to the side of the baggage conveyor. According to the app our luggage is still sitting in Customs. The app snafu made an already long trip 20-30 minutes longer than it needed to be. Over all the best part of the flights was the flight crew. They were generally helpful, informative and seemed genuinely apologetic for the trouble with the flight."
Date of travel: November 2019,30,nickel and dime,"I wound up in zone main cabin 3, which meant that I was certain that the plane would take off before I got on.  First military, then first class. or whatever it is called, then something plus, then main cabin 1, then 2 finally 3.  Seats are small, the aisle is miniscule.  I am really tired of airlines nickel and diming for every single thing, no food to speak of (including the snacks which could feed a snail).  I am not happy flying almost any airline except some European ones, but I need to do it if I want to get where I want to be."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great trip to NYC,Had a great experience flying with Delta.  The crew were very friendly.  The seats were comfortable.  There is more leg room on Delta than I found on United Airlines and even better then American Airlines (which is my least favorite of airlines).
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Delta airlines,I always fly delta air lines because they treat you all right. They are on time to get you to your destination. The best thing is to get sky miles account to get free miles and all the discounts .
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Incredible service to reschedule an emergency flight back home.,My wife broke her ankle while we were on vacation in Hawaii.  It only took Delta about 20 minutes to re-book us on a flight 4 days early to return home.  They upgraded our seats to give us more room for her broken ankle.  The total cost was just over $70!They took great care to provide wheelchairs for both flights.Absolute 10+++ stars
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Always very professional and helpful,"We usually fly Delta because we have status with it.  Even though we were late leaving Denver because of a delayed plane from San Francisco, we were kept informed every time the plane changed departure time.  When we arrived in Seattle we were met at the plane arrival gate with a delightful gentleman from Delta who drove us in a Porsche to our sky club departure gate.  We are always treated well at the Denver Sky Club by Ted and Randy."
Date of travel: October 2019,30,YOUR OWN LITTLE CORNER,"Delta’s business class product on their A350-900 fleet features a suite with sliding doors for privacy. So when we booked our flight to Asia we made sure we chose the right plane. The suite was bigger than expected with good ergonomics for the seat and nice mood lighting you can adjust accordingly. The screen was big and sharp with extensive selection of movies, shows and music. Unfortunately, there was no bedding available for the bed and the pillow was too soft. Service was okay with nothing to write home about (response time to call button was significantly delayed). As for the food, I ordered Bibimbap so I can compare it with Asiana and their version was adjusted for the western palate (in a good way) although Asiana’s Bibimbap tasted better.  The bathroom surprisingly had no toiletries...other airlines usually stock their bathrooms with toothbrush, toothpaste, mouthwash, etc but Delta didn’t. I also purchased wifi for the entire flight and it only worked for 3 hours during the 14 hours we were on the air.  Overall it was an okay flight and I think the best part of the experience was having my own little corner inside the plane."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,I love Delta,What a great airline. They really take good care of you during your flight very attentive. Will fly every time with Delta when I get a chance.
Date of travel: November 2019,10,Humiliating treatment by flight attendant,It was the worst experience and treatment by a white attendant. There was some racial bias as I was non white. This was over my special dinner. She treated me like I am flying without paying and when she snatched my breakfast tray when she realized that it was not the special meal. She did not even realize that I have ordered special meal. Then she brought me another tray with eggs which I don’t eat and when I told her so she got angry and that she has unless there is left over. To prevent the scene my daughter who was sitting in next seat exchanged the tray. Everyone around me were in shock. I did not want to create a scene. When I wrote to Delta they took her explanation over mine. This was the most humiliating experience for me. I hope Delta executive see this message and train their attendant better in regards to racial and cultural sensitivity
Date of travel: January 2019,50,Homeward Bound,"Delta is my choice of International Carriers. Crew very diverse, flights of 8 hours and aircraft pristine...love there baggage allowance for Brazil..I will only fly with another International Carrier by force..lol"
Date of travel: June 2019,50,Summer trip,"Hassle free,every thing on time, smooth flight, great onboard staff, great service. Our trip was a pleasure"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Same great service!,I recently went on a trip to Tokyo and decided after that to make Delta my go to airline. Well on my trip to Boston I got the same great service! The flight and crew did not disappoint. Thanks Delta!
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Excellent service and comfortable flight,"Delta has always been one of my favorite airlines but living in Texas (AA Territory) I haven't flown on Delta airlines in several years. So when my clients booked me on Delta for their wedding I was looking forward to the experience. Starting with the people at the ticket counter to the flight attendant the service was very friendly, helpful, fast. The big difference is that their friendliness didn't feel forced nor they sounded like repeating something they were told to say. I took two different planes. The one from San Antonio to Atlanta was very comfortable, especially I love the Comfort Plus seats. From Atlanta to Dothan I flew on a smaller 50 passenger jet. Although not as comfortable as the big jet, for a short 30 minutes hop it was comfortable enough. My only little complaint was that on the flight to San Antonio to Atlanta they did not have headphones for the economy class so I wasn't able to enjoy on flight entertainment."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,It was a much more pleasant flight round trip than with American Airlines,People were super nice.  No long lines. Very helpful. I was in a wheelchair and they got me in and out in record time.  So much better than my flight with American a couple of months before that.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Delta is the best!,I can’t say enough good stuff about Delta! Best staff all around! We were delayed in landing and had to coast the skies for about 45. When the captain received updates he was quick to relay them to the cabin.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Delta vs Spirit and Frontier airlines,"We flew economy with Delta and had a very good experience.  Our two previous flights were on Frontier and Spirit.  I will always fly Delta instead of them. Both Frontier and Spirit keep trying to uocharge you. They keep asking if you want to buy a better, roomier seat.    You pay for carry ons beyond a very small allowed one.  They recommend you pay for your seat to guarantee you will get on the flight.  Snacks and drinks, including water must be purchased.  The seats were extremely uncomfortable with almost no leg room.  In the future I will fly Delta. The extra cost of the fare is worth it."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Good trip,"This was a flight booked by my school district for me. The plane was very clean and even the coach/economy class seats were not as cramped as on other airlines. There was actually room to move around a bit. Both legs were good. The return trip from New Orleans was not the best, the plane broke down and we were taken to a hotel over night and had to fly a different airline (not as good quality) but Delta paid for both the hotel room and our food, which was very much appreciated."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Great Airlines,We take this flight from Detroit to Montego Bay approximately three to four times a year it's a nonstop flight takes approximately 3 hours and 45 minutes but most of the time it arrives early which we do like the service on the plane excellent and you have enough time to watch a good movie!!!
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Sort of bitter-sweet experience,"The trip was a round trip from Des Moines to San Jose, Costa Rica with a stop-over at Atlanta. The first leg from DSM to ATL was the least exciting one. When the aircraft was on the ground, the ventilation system smelt like dust. Once in the air, the dusty smell disappeared.The tray in front of me was not level. Thus, I had to hold the beverage cup and making it difficult to read the book I carried to pass my time. Also, the chair in front of me was, it seemed, permanently, inclined. The crew did not tell the passenger to straighten the back - maybe it was dysfunctional!And finally, the trim (rubber) around the arm-rest was askew.But the return trip was memorable – from SJO to ATL. The light snacks (Sandwiches) served were good. The flight was turbulent and the Captain kept us informed. When the flight stabilized, the cabin crew served the beverages and foods.Overall the experience was Average!"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Flight attendants could have been more helpful to older customers in handleing their luggage.,Flight attendants could have been more caring about the customers.  Even if they do not have to help with stowing luggage if a person is having trouble couldn't they assist in order to help in boarding?
Date of travel: October 2019,20,not to be repeated,"I booked my flight with KLM and expected a KLM flight but it was Delta. I have flown Delta in the past and was not impressed, this flight was no better. The only good thing was the flight home was only about a quarter full so the service was quite good and I had three seats to stretch out on and managed to sleep for some of the journey."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Thanksgiving Trip,Crew and Flight were great.  It was a packed flight but crew made it easy and fast.  Flight a little bumpy but you can not predict the weather.  Thanks for a fast and friendly flight
Date of travel: May 2019,40,Great Flight from Nashville to Boston,"Why was this a great flight and not just OK?  Fair Question.  Generally I do my research.  Usually it is my wife and I who travel.  I like window and she likes aisle, and we like to sit together.  Several times we have purchased an extra seat just to be sure no one sits between us in 3 across seating.  Because this was a narrower plane it has 2 seats on a side.....and the seats are 18.5 inches wide vs the usual 17.  Premium economy gave more leg room.  Best flight I have had in a long time."
Date of travel: October 2019,10,"Good flight, very bad ground crew experience","The flight itself was uneventful, food served was even decent and the flight crew was accommodating. However, upon deplaning and walking a considerable distance in the terminal, we discovered that my wife’s purse had been left in the plane. We both have physical handicaps and walking is very difficult. We went to the nearest Delta desk and the attendant would not help at all, not even to call down to the gate we had left to see if they had found it. She suggested we find a cart, of which we had seen none, to go back to the gate.  She also said the plane had left and we probably wouldn’t find it anyway. Negative with no assistance.  So I had to hoof it myself and,fortunately, the cleaning crew had found it.  Afterward, I wrote to Delta about this experience and have not received a reply to this day. Very, very bad customer service."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Holiday,"We always fly economy class and we did not expect much because some bad reviews , but this flight with Delta Airlines was perfect .Good Seat , perfect food and service , free drinks and recent movies Our best trip since many years ,"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,On time,"They work like clockwork, all in synch .. from the check in to you have arrived , the flight attendants were so nice. One person was sleeping and the attendant left cookies and chips for them when they woke.. that was so sweet and considerate, I will definitely fly them again"
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Delta needs a new dietician,"It's happened again.  I am a diabetic.  Being diabetic, you need to limit carbs.  The regular breakfast was some sort of an egg sandwich, which granted had some carbs, but I was served a bagel, Chex cereal, 2% milk which has 13 grams of sugar and fruit.  On the return trip, I was served turkey on a huge, hard, roll(no mayo, no mustard, with a salad and fruit.  I filled out their surveys( This also happened on my flight to JFK in June, on my way to London). They simply don't care.  As a side note, on the flight to London, the Halal meal for my husband and the diabetic meal for me were the same. That was the first time I complained."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Up and at them!,"When you fly from Jacksonville, NC remember members of the Marine Corps are always traveling somewhere. I find the earlier flights are less expensive and easier to book a seat for the day you want to travel. My trip started on a Federal holiday so there were not many military travelers on official business. Left Jacksonville, NC at 6:00 am, changed planes in Atlanta with time for breakfast and was on the ground in Alexandria, LA by 10:00 am. I was able to make it to work by lunch. I have flown other airlines, the best will always be Piedmont for me, but the fine folks at Delta are always helpful and courteous."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,above and beyond,"I have a chronic illness which can make it difficult to fly; I often require a wheelchair, early boarding, and other assistance that necessitates aid from staff.  Last fall, I was flying Delta from Houston to Indianapolis, with a layover in Atlanta.  Any fears I had about the process were completely alleviated by the Delta employees.  Each flight I boarded, an employee was happy to wheel me from the gate to the plane.  Once on the plane, the stewards and stewardesses would always assist me to my seat.  One stewardess actually noticed that I wasn't feeling well, and immediately brought a ginger ale to me in my seat.  I was touched.  Deplaning went just as smoothly.  The flights themselves were all on time, and got us to our destination safely.  What I'll remember more than the actual flights, though, is that every Delta employee I encountered went above and beyond to ensure my experience was a pleasant one.  Everyone made me feel human and important (which can be a rare occurrence).  Delta obviously cares about its passengers.  After this experience, I will always fly Delta in the future."
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Miserable,Ridiculous security lines. First class on these short trips are a joke. No real benefit other than a larger seating area.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Very impressed,The planes were newer and clean. Even the uniforms were snazzy. Crew was lovely on both flights. Personal screen to watch movie. Had a chilled salmon entree that was amazing. I really couldn't believe how terrific the experience was. Thank you!
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Friendly staff and crew!,"I was stranded in Dallas/Fort Worth on Nov 30 from a long flight coming from Sydney, Aus because of Eastcoast and Westcoast storm/Thanksgiving holidays and could not book any flight but these amazing airline and their staff made sure everyone was looked after! In short I got on board the following day with an upgrade of seat AND 2 drinks coupon to thank me for ""bearing with the delays and make my flight a little bit more comfortable""...I was so happy!!! Not mention I was traveling on staff tickets! Delta has been my go to when everything is not seem to be working...they are just amazing!!! Well, this just goes to show that when the going gets tough, the tough gets going! My whole family and circle of friends are now ONLY traveling Delta!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,A+ Customer Service,"Delta has first class customer service!!  We had an unheard of experience at our local regional airport that caused the flight to be cancelled.  Each Delta agent was superb in their service to help me and my traveling partners arrive at our final destination.  I have always appreciated the care Delta gives.  This time was more special than ever before because the airport (not the carrier) caused the problem; but Delta felt that no matter what, we were their customer and they helped us with the initial objective- getting to California!"
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Flights on Delta Airlines,"I have flown DL several times this year.  The flight atttendants, compared to other carriers are not as professional in personal appearance.  The seats have less leg room.  I have to pretty much fly DL because I live in a hub."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Comfortable journey,"After our Holiday visit to Disney world Florida, we returned to PHL via ATL layover for 1 hr through Delta Airlines.We started at 8pm flight on 2nd December, and reached ATL airport well in time.The checked in luggage is chargeable.The in flight complimentary snacks & drinks are very good & the staff are very courteous & helpful. The linked flight also started & reached in time at Philly .In flight they have offered blanket also for this night trip.Overall the experience is comfortable & very good."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Flight to Alaska,We sat in the exit row to have extra leg room which was wonderful.  The flight attendants were wonderful & the flight was safe & on time.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Delta gets it right!,"We use Delta for almost all of our travel (thank you skymiles!).  However, we had to book another carrier for a same day flight recently and UGH!  Delta has ruined us...we  so accustomed to top notch service from check in to baggage claim that is was a shock to the system when this other carrier was late on both legs of the flight, there was water and oj only and the bathroom in first class was not functional (as long as ther ewas a functional one, Im good lol).  the gate was changed last minute on both of our flights too!  Why am I telling you this in a review of Delta?  Because I have nothing bad to say about Delta!  It dosent matter if you are in first class or coach, Delta treats you like they are happy you chose them!  Thank you Delta"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Nov. Cancun,"Flight from AVP terminal to Atlanta to Cancun, no issues, was problem free, required wheelchair at each terminal, person was their waiting and helped with luggage and was very kind."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Great flight and comfortable seating,"An amazing flight on their new A350 aircraft! Great seating, legroom, entertainment, food just an overall great experience on a long flight, 13 hours plus."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Delta Airlines a Good experience,"I was concerned because of all the bad press airlines have been receiving the past few years. Everything was right about this flight, lots of legroom & space, food and snacks very good and the stewards/ess were pleasant and helpful. Would definitely fly with Delta on our next trip."
Date of travel: July 2019,50,Delta high,"So easy.  Left and arrived on schedule.  Courteous staff both in the air and on the ground.  Most importantly, no annoying time changes.Best American airline."
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Delta First Class Falls Short of Expectations,"It was with great anticipation that I booked my frequent flyer first class flight to Pittsburgh on October 22, 2019.  It was a little difficult to see the difference between business class and First Class.However, that said, the service was impeccable, though hurried.  I enjoyed the wonderfully natural, organic food choices and plentiful hydration.Fundamentally all of us are on the same plane, and I found it hard to see any difference between the various classes.  Each seat had wonderful digital selectionsthat included airline/inflight information, CNBC and ESPN, among others.Maybe the route through Atlanta and La Guardia seemed to lengthen the trip.But the real test of travel are you energized or fatigued following the destination, and I was definitely energized upon disembarking at Greater Pittsburgh International Airport!"
Date of travel: December 2019,20,Delta as expected,"Plane had not yet left JFK when we were supposed to board at Bermuda.  By the time we were to leave Bermuda, we had missed our connecting flight to Buffalo.  I was  told that we would have to drive to LaGuardia for a 10pm flight to Buffalo.  I returned our duty-free items since we would have to go through security again.  On arrival at JFK I asked a young man named Shaun about getting to LaGuardia and told him why.  Shaun responded by saying ""just a minute, let me look something up"".  He found that Delta had a flight from JFK to Buffalo at 10:10pm.  He saved us the chore of schlepping ourselves and our luggage to LaGuardia, paying a cab and another trip through security.  I asked why Delta didn't know this in Bermuda.  He said he didn't know.  If I hadn't been convinced long ago that Delta doesn't know how to run an airline I never would have second guessed them and talked to the nice young man.  Delta as usual."
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Small seats!!,Normally I am very pleased with Delta but my travel agent graciously signed me up to comfort class for more leg room and I ended up wedged in a window seat 10A where the arm rest do not lift and I was most uncomfortable.  I am a big person and this should be considered as I am one of many. The poor woman on 10B was also a big person so we were equally uncomfortable for the 3 hour flight.  Aisle seats should be offered to big people as they are often more comfortable and arm rests that go up providing more room are essential .
Date of travel: October 2019,20,Basic economy seating inhumane for overnight flight,"Do go in basic economy for an overnight flight.Spacing is so tight it is impossible to relax, much less be comfortable.Upgrade to premium economy for the overnight trip."
Date of travel: July 2019,40,Comfort in the Sky.,"The pilots and flight attendants have all been phenomenal when I have flown Delta. The comfort and food are wonderful on long flights. Time goes by faster when watching movies and playing games on the small TV screens. Their safety measures are awesome. My only beef is with some of the personnel at the Delta counters at the Ft. Lauderdale or Detroit Airports. Some aren't the friendliest or brightest. Otherwise, I would give this airline a perfect 5."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Superior Service on Delta Airlines,"Delta is really raising the bar on service compared to the other domestic airlines. When American cancelled their non-stop flights to New Orleans I bit the bullet and started flying Delta in order to save the connection time in Dallas. To my surprise, Delta's service was superior to American or United. The flight crew was attentive and snacks were plentiful. The flight attendants were friendly and even funny in many cases. I am a frequent business traveler, having flown over 4 million miles and have experienced the top tier frequent flier programs on both American and United. Delta seems to be working really hard to exceed expectations. I believe good service should be rewarded and I am happy to give the thumbs up to Delta for their excellent service."
n/a,40,Flying home on Delta,"Delta is my Airline of choice because they are constantly good at getting me where I need to be on time and without any real hassle.  This was no different, we left on time and arrived on time.  The service was good and the attendant were very nice!"
Date of travel: April 2019,50,GREAT SERVICE AND COMPETENT PEOPLE,"Delta provides great service with great equipment and competent people who really care about their customers.  i recently had a flight where areomexico ( a delta partner ) had to reoute me on a mxf - slc leg to american through houston. when i got to houston american would'nt give me a boaring pass to slc. after much hassle i went to the delta desk. they put me up for the night and got me to slc the next day, found my bag which american had lost, and got me to my final destination. they have helped me several times on travel i had to delay."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,The flight experience was good,"The experience with Delta is good, they were very accommodating for me. I am always reviewing how much a flight cost.  I separated my flight from Austin to JFK and purchased another flight from JFK to Berlin and departed from Amsterdam (much cheaper that way)."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great on time flight,"Nice seats and service, good food and very relaxing non stop trip to New Orleans. Landed at the brand new New Orleans terminal which is very nice."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Efficiant as usual,We flew from Atlanta to Ft Lauderdale for a cruise out of Port Everglades. Delta as usual was efficient and did there job of safely getting us to and from Ft Lauderdale.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Rescue flights to take care of the animals!,My son had made the flight arrangements due to fact we were coming to animal sit while the went to Paris. The first flight from SYracuse to Detroit was great. We ate in Detroit airport then caught flight from Detroit to Salt Lake City. The plane had arrive later then expected so the crews on the ground were rushed to get the plane ready for us. The frustration was the length of time to load the plane. I felt it was more the passengers taking so long to organize themselves getting on and placing their luggage “stuff”.They passengers were asked many times to tag the rolling bags BUT many of them hung on. Boarding was a little unorganized. Due to all of this we were late coming in to Salt Lake City so we had to run to our flight in another wing. When my husband got there they were about to load the plane so we made it. Flights were great. And my daughter in law April placed 2nd in the APP world tour!
n/a,50,Fantastic value!,"We paid $125 for a basic ticket (no checked bag included). Round trip, non stop. Flight was on time. Staff were friendly. The trip was very enjoyable. 8 enjoyed the tv/movie/games that were offered. Highly recommend!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Tuscany in December,Delta has seriously upgraded their service to the Main Economy Cabin for this direct flight from RDU to CDG. I must admit I am a long time fan of Delta even in the good and bad and I have taken this flight segment several times in the past. The Crew was enthusiastic and proud of the new service and food upgrades.
Date of travel: September 2019,40,"Better than most other carriers, with a few small issues","I have flown on this route a few years ago, and was delighted to see that one of the new features they've introduced lately is a rough schedule/menu handout that lets you know the order of the food/drink services, and the various options.  However, despite the glossy flyer telling you of all of these potential selections, they were running out of entree options fairly quickly into the dinner service, and were down to only one by the time they got to us (less than half way into economy).  Also, basically all of the items offered for the dinner service contained dairy in one way or another, which I'm trying to reduce.  Next time, I might try to request a special dietary meal instead of hoping there might be lower-dairy options available, like the Thai Chicken Salad that ran out first.One other minor annoyance: when arriving at the airport, Delta kept listing the flight as On Time, even though sites like FlightAware kept showing us as delayed 45 to 60 minutes, starting as early as 4 hours before scheduled departure.  Delta waited until the scheduled boarding time to finally, officially acknowledge that those sites were correct, and we were delayed by the same amount.  If Delta filed an amended flight plan with the delayed takeoff, I don't think they should continue to communicate boarding/takeoff times to the passengers that can no longer legally happen.  Be open and honest with us.To be clear: I actually prefer Delta over most other carriers for flights to Europe from PDX, especially in comparison to my previous experiences on United and Aer Lingus.  The issues I've mentioned are relatively minor, but places where I think they have room for improvement."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Most comfortable of all,So happy with my experience on Delta. The hosts were attentive and pleasant. The seats were clean and comfortable and the flight was smooth.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Surprising Flight,"Seemed that Delta was trying very hard to please us passengers.  Started with free mimosas, more than 1 if you wanted. Choice between 3 meals, wine with supper, another go of wine after supper.  It was an overnight flight, then hot breakfast, choice of 2 breakfast sandwiches, fruit, coffee.  Flight itself was excellent, great weather all the way.  Only issue at all was that our flight was combined with Delta 60, we had booked good seats, but they were taken away due to change. Our flight was with Delta via Gol (Brazilian airline) but had same flight #.  So we got really crappy seats, right in the front with wall in your face & NO legroom, smack in the middle of the plane, quite miserable for sleeping, which we could not do. Wouldn’t have been an issue if it was a short flight, but we were on there for 13 hrs."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Best Airlines,"Ive been traveling Delta for a few years, so, at the right moment there's not a better airline, best service on board, and at the counter, the person at the counter in providence called by my name, she remember me flying tow weeks prior. that was awesome."
Date of travel: May 2019,50,Love the flight attendents. Excellent service,"Great accomodations. First trip to Europe in 1st class, and verything about it was 1st class, from the moment we boarded, to the food, and of course the service from the whole crew."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Excellent Stopover in ATL!,"Note: Pay for SkyClub access! It's the best! As always, Delta provided great service, friendly attendants, and a smooth boarding process.I'll be flying Delta again soon!"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Excellent flight.,First time flying Delta. It was a very nice flight. Back of seat monitors for watching a movie. Comfortable seats. Didn’t try the food. Excellent flight attendants. Our luggage was on time. One slightly delayed flight from Minneapolis to Sacramento.
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Excellent flight on Delta,"Check in was easy and great. We had our printed vouchers, there were several Delta areas open for luggage loading and that was quick. The Delta waiting area was clean. All of the staff were wonderful and happy to assist you during both flights there and back. I loved the ability to a movie. It had been several years since I had flown and the fact that I could watch the plane travel if I liked was great. I have another trip booked and I will be flying Delta once again!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Flyng to Sunny Sand Diego,"This particular flight was delayed, but Delta is GREAT about letting you know (by TXT) quickly.  The boarding was uneventful, and the fight attendants are always great.  We almost exclusively fly Delta because of the customer care."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,DTW to Houston and return/DELTA,"Great locations after parking to drop off bags, decent lines thru security, on time boarding and comfortable seats, decent service during flight too."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,easy flight and fun city,I paid extra for leg room and it was worth it. Flight was delayed because we didn't have a crew! We left three hours late but it was a smooth ride and easy flight. Coming back we had no problems and arrived ahead of schedule. Flight crew and attendants were lovely. Snacks were minuscule. Don't board without your own food or snacks. My husband was in a regular seat and the person next to him had a child on her lap. The row behind him had two dogs. He said it was terrible.
Date of travel: July 2019,50,You can't get there from here,Did you know there is more than one way to get anywhere? One option is to start a day before the day you want to get there or pick a route that will give you a day or two in a place you want to visit. Flights where full from JFK to EDI so we took a flight to Amsterdam where we could get one of four flights to EDI or we could have gone to Paris or Dublin. Spend the day or night  in one of these cities and then continue to your destination. We actually continued our trip and arrived in EDI just a little later than planned.
Date of travel: September 2019,40,it was an ok flight with some disappointment in the promise of more legs room,"the first flight to Atlanta was amazing , the legs room for the economy plus was great and we looked forward for the flight to Germany, Unfortunately, the economy plus in this flight was NOT at all the same, the legs room was about 5 to 7 inches more and when the passenger in  front of you reclined, you can forget the extra room, food was as usual in  flight , ok to sustain but not special but they feed you 2 times which is better than others company that charge you for a sandwich ( icelandair for example ), anyway be very careful when booking for economy plus, the extra fee  is not worthy"
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Not the greatest experience after flying with Delta for many years.,I am flying with Delta for many years. The company I work for using most of the time Delta. I did not have good experience on the flight from CDG to ATL. The overweighted male flight attendant was moving through the aisle like without any awareness or better he did not care how many times he hit someone and knock people from the armrest. A not a single time he apologized and look at me like that's your mistake you should not have an arm on the armrest. When he served food his big butt was in my face and I could smell he was sweating badly. Delta should care more about customers and change the criteria for flight attendants.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,On Time Arrivals and Departures!!!,Thank you Delta Airlines for a nice trip to and from Austin Texas.  We used our Companion ticket for this trip and it was easy to use with out issues and also my husbands ticket was a good deal too.  Plus we were upgraded to comfort plus on our way home perfect because we had a short time between flight in Atlanta so it was so nice to be able to be in the front part of the plane and depart in plenty of time.  My husband is a Silver Medallion customer and most always uses Delta even for our European trips.   We hope your service never changes!!!! Loyal Customer.
Date of travel: May 2019,50,China Bound,"Booked through Delta, but flew Korean Air from Atlanta to Seoul.  Fabulous service from the crew.  First time we have flown directly North over the North Pole to Korea."
Date of travel: October 2019,20,Comfortable flight but 17 Hours without entertainment,"So much for a 17-hour relaxing flight watching movies and playing games. The server was out so there was no access to the TV screen.Otherwise, the flight was enjoyable, the foot was decent and Premium Delux is worth the money for extra legroom. Unfortunately, I didn't have a book to read.Check in was a madhouse in Joburg. There was so much confusion as to which zone to    go by."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Cheaper air tickets,"Ok here is a tip for all the dummy travelers who want to pay a higher price for a ticket not just to Vienna but everywhere. So go to Expedia, Orbitz, Priceline and a few others. Book bundle or package. That means you book a  room somewhere. This is the craziest thing ever. So RT air only it $1150 bucks just saying. Add a hotel for say 2 days and the price including 4 star hotel is $750. So you reduce price by $450 and get 2 nights hotel. Weird huh? Well my latest deal was I booked a hostel for 1 night which costs $28 euros and got the RT for $677 and did not stay at the hostel.Never, ever book flight only to Europe add one day room and reduce the price per tick by 35-40%."
Date of travel: July 2019,50,my daughter's 1st domestic First Class flight,"I had some miles so I decided to treat my daughter for her 1st flight upfront and she loved it! Starting from the Sky Priority Check in, to 1st on the plane, and the very attentive service on board.Delta gave us our meals on real China with silverware on a nice crisp tablecloth. The food and drinks were good! The entertainment system is a good size and has many sections.We had a experience!"
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Best first class!,"Flying first class from Atlanta to Rome with Delta is so comfortable and relaxing. Staff was more than courteous and the food was pretty good for an airline! Flying at night is great as after dinner you watch a movie or your choosing in your own little cubicle and then off to sleep.  The seat reverts to a “bed” and adjusts to many positions. You have a blanket, pillow and foam ear silencers if needed. Waking up there are great breakfast choices and before you know it....your there!  I always fly Delta no matter where I go as I find they are the friendliest and most accommodating. Only thing I would change is that they need to be more diligent in cleaning from the previous flight. I always bring disinfecting wipes with me."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Love Delta,I always take Delta for my business trips to Las Vegas.  I love the smaller plane with two seats per side. (Outfitted with Compass Air employees and pilots-young teams.)   I had two great flight attendants who continued to work through rough air with smiles on their faces. (Even when costumers were puking.)  Jerel and Brandi were awesome and would love for them to be acknowledged.  They had personality and were super friendly.  Very cool to experience and it made the rough turbulence bearable because of their demeanor.
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Delta Airline flight from DTW 2 MCO,"Nice crew, service, also had tv included 4 flight price. Flight was good 2 there & back. On way back; I flew from MCO 2 ATL. This flight was also nice man. I recommend Delta 4 flying because of this. -Bart"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Holiday Flight,Busy time of he year for travel.  I was pleased that my flight was on time in both directions.  Everyone was nice and I had no problems.  Just remember to get to the airport early to go through the lines.  Delta is not responsible for the mess at LAX - constant changes and construction. Pilot kept us informed due to  slight delay at the de icing pad.
Date of travel: January 2019,50,Heavenly comfortable,"From the time I parked at these airports I was accommodated happily, warmly. The staff was pleasant and professional. The flights variety of movies, other online activities were appreciated. I thought I would sleep but I didn't have time to because I cuddled up in the throw they gifted and watched a movie and play an online game."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Love this Airline,"We love Delta Air Lines.  They really take care of you in every way.  It was a long flight but they offered us water, warm towel, drinks, a meal, dessert, drinks, and a breakfast."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,DELTA AIRLINES...GREAT SERVICE!!!!,DELTA AIRLINES...Great Service...Many Thanks Again For All Your Help and Customer Service...You All Are Doing Great...Keep Up The Great Work!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Date of travel: September 2019,10,Delta Will NOT HELP YOU when one of their Partner Airlines Damages Your Luggage,"I used the Delta website to book a ticket from JFK to Nairobi and then back to my home city which was not JFK.  When I arrived in Nairobi I discovered my luggaged had been badly damged.  I called Delta and told them what happened. They stated as Kenya Airways was the last to handle my bag they were responsible for repairs, replacement or compensation.  I contacted Kenya Airways and was told to take the bag to their YaYa Centre office for resolution.  I delivered the bag to Kenya Airways and was told within 10 days it would be repaired, replaced or compensated.  On several occasions I returned to the Kenya Airways YaYa office to find out the status of the bag.  Each time i was told it was being handled. I repeatedly contacted Delta and informed them the matter was not being resolved and I was scheduled to leave in a few weeks.  Delta stated there was nothing they could do because Kenya Airways was the last one to handle the bag.   Approximately four weeks later I requested the bag be returned.  At that time I was offered $30US minus 10% for a bag that was 17 days old.  I declined the offer and requested the bag be returned to me.  At that time I was notified the bag could be picked up at the YaYa Centre as it had never left.  They could offer no explaination as to why the bag had never been sent out for repairs.  I received the bag the same day I was scheduled to leave.  We could no longer use DHL for our excess documents and items.  Instead we had to use tape and glue to secure the bag.  Once at the airport I have to pay overweight fees and fees for wrapping the bag.  Adding insult to injury although my return from Paris to the United States my bag did not arrive with the others.  Initially Delta stated that one bag had only been checked to JFK this was despite the fact I had a baggage claim ticket stating my home city.  When it was delivered the next day it had more damage and items inside had been broken.I believe Delta could have done more to assist me as my travel originated and ended with Delta and they were the ones paid to transport me.  Delta did absolutely nothing but continue to pass the blame to Kenya Airways and tell me there was nothing they could do."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Direct flight from MSP to MEX.. nice,"After years of flying through ATL, the long awaited direct flight from Minneapolis to Mexico City is a wonderful time saver.  Nothing against ATL, but so nice to have a non-stop to Mexico City.  Service was fantastic as usual on Delta."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Best!,We fly a lot of different air lines but Delta is the best. We flew from LA to JFK then to Milan Italy and back again. Delta is the only Air Lines that feed us both internationally AND domestic. Service is always #1. Thank you Delta!
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Went out of their way to help with difficult connections,"Delta was soooo much better than united ever is. Plane had mechanical issues so over an hour later for take off, effecting connections. United tells you its the risk you take when you fly. Delta proactively booked flights in case connections didn't work, helped get through process quickly. I will use delta whenever I can"
Date of travel: May 2019,50,good flight,"I always enjoy flying Delta because the care about their customers, where other airlines don't. It is always smooth and enjoyable."
Date of travel: October 2019,10,Horrible experience,We arrived over an hour before our flight BUT because we would not be thoguh secruty an hour before our flight they would not even let us check our bags.  We had to find a new flight with a different airline.  They will not refund us for our Delta tickets we could not loose AND we had to pay an extra $800.00 ontop of it all for a flight we were not late for.  Very upsetting.  Not to mention I am pregnant traveling with a one year old.  Weill never fly Delta again
Date of travel: November 2019,20,Trumped,Delay because of trump arrival Pilot had run out of hours because of trump and lack of fuelSignificant delayDelta should have anticipated this since it was announce early in day when flight would arriveNever heard from them about compensation for delay
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Great airline,Great staff- even at check in the people were very helpful- Delta did an all around great job on both legs of our flight !
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Best Service Out of LGA,I ALWAYS fly Delta. Have been a loyal customer for years. Their service is tops. Their inflight crews polite and professional. Their terminal at LGA is far away from the construction mess. It’s an oasis of calm in airport of calamity.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,My twelfth flight to the US with Delta,"It was a smooth flight as usual; nice cabin crew and good food. Checking bagage in at Schiphol was mainly a ""self service"", since I already checked in online.  The entertainment was a bit meagre, but it took me only 20 minutes to pass pasport check and picking up my suitcases."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Flight to Las Vegas,"We took off at 10am, a convenient tIme. Arriving on time, at 12:55pm. Its a perfect time to get into Vegas. Being that most hotels check in time is 3 or 4 pm. The crew was friendly and professional."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Good Flight,"Good overall experience.  The coach seats were really tight, so I ended up upgrading to Comfort+ seats using my SkyMiles.  It was an easy process to upgrade my seats and I was able to select the seats I wanted for each leg of the flight."
Date of travel: November 2019,20,Disney Unmagic,The airline didn't have the correct Globes number nad didn't fix it.  We had to wait on line to check our bag go through security
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great flight,"We were late boarding which was a bit of a mess, but, overall, it was a great flight and excellent coffee."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Highly Recommended,"Efficient, comfortable seating, great entertainemt services, flight attendants showed customer service"
Date of travel: June 2019,50,Best flight ever,"Our first International flight and flying Delta was the best experience. Delta employees was really nice at the check -in and flight attendants amazing. Some people said that Delta is too expensive, well, it depends when you buy the ticket to be honest, if you buy in advance you can get same price as Southwest for example, Delta usually has about 25 seats at the lowest fare, of course those tickets goes quick, so my tip is buy in advance before it goes."
Date of travel: May 2019,40,A smooth and enjoyable flight,"My flight was delayed but because of illness on the inward flight. However, when we got going we managed to get to Boston in 7 hours, an excellent time. In addition, my plane was the A330, and I think that plane is a gem. I had bought my return flight for an excellent price and had more than enough food and drink to cover the 7 hours."
Date of travel: October 2019,30,it was O.K.,"didn't like the hidden baggage fees that we were not told of, other than that is was O.K.the flight was on time"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Good Flight,I fly often and have used many different airlines.  This time I choose Delta because it was a direct flight.  The seating was comfortable.  The amenities were nice.  The flight attendants were very courteous.  The flight was on time as scheduled.  I highly recommend flying Delta.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Trip to Alabama to see grandkids,"Flight Cleveland left on time and the flight from Atlanta to Huntsville also left on time.Full planes, Return flights were also full and on time"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,direct on time flights,"extra room seat, nice flight on time non stop, what more to ask for.  I like the service, professional attitude, and safey etcc."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,returning home from DC,"Superb service.  Everyone was in a good mood, even the other passengers.  All went well and arrived in time for connecting flight"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"On-time, great seat and very friendly flight attendants",Booked seat 27F at the emergency Exit Row and got the extra legroom. Seat was great and the flight attendants very friendly and effective on this short-haul. Flight was quick but we had to wait 15 minutes for the gate to be clear of a departing aircraft. Got to the gate on-time at made the tight internatinal connection departing at the other end af the airport.
Date of travel: May 2019,50,Airplanes are always on time and the stewardesses courteous and cheerful,"Our flights both ways were 1 stop and the flights always left on time and arrived on time.  The stewards and stewardesses were very friendly, seemed to love their job, and even had a great sence of humor!  We loved flying with Delta."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Oh Canada,As always Delta flight was on time seating not to bad. We sat in the extra leg room seats. Boarding was fairly quick . No complaints from me.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Comfortable flight with excellent food and service,"Efficient and attentive staff.Food was excellent and a massive choice of inflight entertainment.Lovely extra touches such as hot cloths to clean up soon after we boarded, earplugs and eye mask to relaxAlso a welcome cocktail Couldn’t fault the flight which seem to go very quickly"
n/a,10,Delta,"Sorry, but it feels like every Delta employee does not want to be here and hates their job. Also, half of the flight does not have their seats assigned (Delta special) which created a boarding havoc (again). I'm not sure why I fly Delta  anymore ...."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Needed to go to Boston,"Had not been on Delta for sometime, but had to go to Boston for an appointment. It also depends on where I am going in the US."
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Quick Visit,"It was quick and efficient, convenient. Clean and the cabin staff are nice. They are very accommodating and helpful."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Excellent as always,"Best airline for us. Always on time, professional boarding, excellent customer service either by phone, text or chat."

Date of travel: December 2019,40,Very friendly service,"It is a older service crew that obviously love their jobs and the opportunity to be still doing their jobs at their age. Very motherly, caring service. My family and I love flying the Atlanta - Stuttgart route with Delta."
Date of travel: December 2019,20,NO handicapped assistance. Flight crew frightened me in appearance and knowledge.,"My flight was booked through Air France but for the first time it was a code share with Delta.  Don't know if this is because of the labor disputes now taking place in France. One large flight attendant looks almost asleep.  She should have been replaced. Another large flight attendant, he took up the full aisle. Bellinis were flat. Headsets not on seat as with Air France and handed out later than I expected. Crew wasn't familiar with new menu.  I noted sandwiches were noted as snacks and then they looked around and found them.  At least they looked after telling me it was catering fault. Wine is served from a large bottles. No bridge at landing and we were at a remote terminal and had to walk down stairs with no handicapped assistance;"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Fantastic,"Our attempt to avoid flying American Airlines paid off.  We flew Delta comfort + for the first time and our experience could not have been better.  The flight was on time every time and the service was exceptional.  There was hot towels, blankets, pillows, eye mask, nice dinner, snacks, pretty nice seats.  Also, I was very, very, impressed by a bereavement flight I booked for a friend who was carrying the ashes of her husband back to the US.  THEY ACTUALLY CARED!!!! There was actual sympathy and kindness for this grieving woman.  In the past this kind of customer service was normal, but now it's unusual (sad to say)."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Not what was exoected,"Flew from London to Boston on a Delta Airlines flight. Not having travelled in an American Carrier before, thought it would be more or less a peanut and soda airline. But right from aircraft interiors, to on board catering, everything was as good as any highly rated Asian or Middle Eastern airline. The staff were friendly and attentive and the I flight entertainment was adequate for a seven hour flight. Will definitely fly Delta again"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"Quite simply, THE BEST","My wife and I fly all over the world. From start to finish, Delta is in a league of their own. They are efficient, helpful, courteous and are committed to their customers. Moreover, they seem to enjoy and take pride in their work. Most other airlines could learn from them..."
Date of travel: October 2019,10,Worst flight ever!,We were advised before boarding that the flight was very full and if the overhead bins were closed there was no room for bags.We were the last group to be called and not space was availa ble.  We were forced to put our wheely bags in front of our knees for the whole of the 3 and a half hour flight.  At no time before or immediately after boarding did the staff offer to put the bags in the hold.  The staff were not dressed smartly and looked rather scruffy and the snack was inedible.  By the time we left the flight my ankles and legs were badly swollen and remained like that for days.  I have written to Delta but no reply has come back.I will never fly with them again.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Always on top of their game,"When I used to fly 100,000 miles a year in my previous career , Delta was my airline of choice, as my FF miles wind down, I still use Delta even when I have to pay. Always friendly, helpful, enjoy the experience each time."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Delta Flight,"Premium passenger so I had access to the Sky Lounge in Paris. Very nice. Flight was on time. Premium seating allowed for good meal service, larger viewing screen, and a bit nicer seats."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Always good,Always good with Delta. Our flight was on time leaving and arrived in Florida early. First Class attendants were very friendly and helpful. On-board entertainment was great.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Mostly Smooth,This was a great trip with very good connections.  Very early start so expect to see some issues.  I would have given this trip 5 stars if there hadn't been a nasty gate agent.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Flight to New York,Cannot fault delta airlines we were treated like royalty from hot towels before dinner to eye masks and blankets as well as headphones and free inflight catering and movies all in all it made the 7 hours pass quickly. The quality of food was astounding. Staff were respectful and friendly.
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Food,Food...Boston to LA ...Economy...preordered vegetarian. Vegetable wrap very goodBusiness class...LA to Sydney...preordered vegetarian....AWFUL..possibility the worse airline food ...ever!! Bean and whatever else burger.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Reliable Delta,"A couple of months ago we flew on a birthday trip for me from San Francisco to Minneapolis for a week, then on to Washington D.C. to visit my home town of Gettysburg for another week, then back home. I chose to fly all 3 legs of the journey on Delta quite deliberately as we have had bad experiences with United and some other airlines, but only good ones with Delta. Our seats have been more comfortable, the personnel friendly and helpful,and good entertainment with movies and games helping the time fly by. All legs of the journey went well. We will be flying Delta again for Christmas visiting family in just over a week. Thanks, Delta, for making our travel plans more pleasant. We will be choosing you for most of our travel."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Delta Air,"Me and my wife visit Okinawa every year, sometimes twice, like last year we went in July and november. I always find the best deal, and airlines isn't a problem at all. I flew on JAL, ANA, AirChina, Delta, United, and even Northwest  a long time ago. I like Delta Air because they use Boeing 767, and the airplane is a 2-3-2 seat abreast which makes me and my wife to seat together on window side. Once entering Japan we fly on a domestic flight to Okinawa, and Delta Air does a good job at that. Delta Air gives good service on the flight, and in my opinion is better than JAL and ANA. Delta Air uses old Boeing 767 from Honolulu to all destination in Japan, but their planes are clean and well kept. From march of 2020 Delta will be flying to Haneda to Narita, and I will be looking on their connection to Okinawa. They also have one flight that goes to Inchon  Korea and from there to Okinawa."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Good experience,"Good and friendly staff, Good food, good airline. They bend backward to help, give advice and to make us feel comfortable. The food was unexpectedly good, and the aircraft clean. I will fly Delta again"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,"To go cheap or not, that is the question","We recently returned home from Panama City Beach to Portland on Delta.  I purchased what I believe was called Basic Economy, the cheapest fare possible.  The problem was they didn't let you pick your seats.  I figured we'd be all right but my wife was worried that we wouldn't get  to sit together.  At our flight change in Atlanta, we asked someone at a desk if we could get our seat assignments.  He gruffly told us no, that we couldn't get them till we got to our gate.  Not friendly at all.  We got to our gate and to our relief we had been seated together in the back row of the plane.  That was okay.  Then we found out that they had moved our gate to the end of another wing so we had to rush over to the new gate.  Finally, as we were about to board, I looked up at the seat assignment screen and saw that our seats had changed.  I asked the lady at the desk if our seats could change.  She said no but then thought for a second and said that yes they had changed because someone had requested the back seats.  We get on the plane and find out that we were in an exit row with lots of leg room.  So it turned out good but I will not say buying basic economy is a good idea.  It is just another way that airlines are charging more after advertising a cheap price, just like charging for luggage.  Otherwise the flight was fine.  The good part was that we could fly home from a small airport so the boarding process was quite easy."
Date of travel: June 2019,50,First class!,"Outstanding! I’ve never had such a huge, tender, tasty filet mignon! Lovely blankets and truly flat seats for sleeping. Zero complaints. Huge contrast to KLM whose first class everything was second rate."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Stepdaughters wedding,I must say I was very impressed on my way to JFK at the front desk the gate attendant was so nice he asked me I would love if I would like to check my bag and I did and I was able to get onto the flight earlier instead of being one of the last ones to board. The flight attendants were very accommodating with our drinks and very pleasant as we boarded.
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Domestic Flight Chaos,"I would like to start out with the fact that we missed our flight due to craziness at the airport. There had been some issues the day before with flights and those issues seemed to carry over to the next day. The lines were ridiculous! We ended up on the next flight out so that was totally fine. This was partially our fault. We should have been at the airport earlier.  There were 2 other people that were there earlier and they still missed the flight as well. No big deal! We got to our destination and carried on the our trip. The flight home was another story! I have 2 children and I was not very happy to say the least. My husband. Son, and daughter sat together and I sat across from them. I had to listen to things that I really didn't want my daughter to hear on this flight. The bad part is that the person was sitting behind my daughter in a Delta uniform. This employee was talking very loud and definitely very proud of the conversation. I called Delta when I arrived home and they didn't want to do anything about it. All that I asked was for them to return some of our skymiles. They informed me that they could only do very little. I will not go into detail. I just wish that people would respect little ears that are around."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Smooth,"Smooth operation from checking in at counter, to getting to gate, to boarding, to being taken care of by flight attendants.  No meal was being served due to length of flight and the snacks were insubstantial.  Just cookies and other carb items were offered.  No seatback IFE, have to use own device. But I still prefer Delta over others.  Another thing, the check-in personnel in PHL were not very attentive as should be for flying first class.  Two men were busy discussing the past football game the entire time I was checking in."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Always Great,"Delta is my fave, we don’t any other airline in country. They are always do courteous, helpful and friendly. We very often get upgraded, nice perk! My only complaint is when they are offering water/coffee or collecting trash, they always walk so fast, you have to flag them down or they walk right past. They should look into each row to see who has a need, not make you wave them down."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Best Airline,We really like Delta Airlines. Always feels like home. Everyone is so nice. We try to fly Delta all the time.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Wheelchair access has been moved further away from TSA lines,"I often fly from Detroit to Boston and use wheelchairs since the flights usually leave from the furthest gates. Recently, the wheelchair pick -up was moved from very nearthe check in to the furthest away one could get from the check-in (one almost needed a wheelchair to reach it!).  Who thought up this crazy maneuver?"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"Great flight attendants, on time, luggage landed with me!","The timeliness of Delta is excellent, the attendants are exceptional, the planes are clean and comfortable."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,New Coach dinner experience,Very comfortable seating - worth the extra bucks for this 7 hour trip. Service and food was very good.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Better than expected,Great service and extras like a warm cookie made me feel like they thought of me as an individual person rather than just a number. It helped take some of the pain out of a very long flight.
Date of travel: August 2019,50,The only way to fly,The crew could not have been nicer.  They were there when we needed them but did not bother us.  Every one was wonderful.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Good flight with delux economy,Flying with Delta I upgraded to delux economy which I highly recommend. You get more leg room and can board right after first/business class which is really nice if u have carry on. If possible I will always upgrade if I can.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Good Airline,"Always a good experience, clean aircraft, quality seats with entertainment and power outlet options."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,I love flying newer planes,"For such a short flight, I was expecting a CRJ.  It wasn't.  It was a newer plane without screens but they weren't needed for such a short flight."
Date of travel: March 2019,30,Small seats,"Seats were close and small. Cart kept hitting my arm as it went by. On the long night flight that food was offered for sale, I wasn’t aware of what was available.  I asked she told me to look in the magazine and moved on. Never had a chance to order again. The inflight movies were nice"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,first class - rhinelander to florida - all a great flight,great delta service from rhinelander through minneapolis and return - would really like more direct flights from Ohare to florida
n/a,40,Europe Trip,"I recently traveled from LAX to Nice - France with stop over in Amsterdam. The service was great and food also wasn't too bad. Of course I had to change my flight from Amsterdam to Nice using KLM which was oK too. For the first flight which was about 8 hours, traveling in Premium Economy wasn't too bad of course traveling in Business Class would have been better especially in A350 plane which is the newer version and more room. The only thing that I would like to recommend is that to book and get your ticket at least 2-3 months in advance while prices are lower. Overall I will give 8 out of 10 for this flight."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Nice Flight,"It was a beautiful flight on time and very smooth , I like Delta very much and have been flying with them for many years."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Perfect Flight,"As always, Delta provided exceptional service on our flight to Phoenix, AZ. The pilot and crew kept us informed on our flying time and other items we needed to know. The crew was around all the time with refreshments and snacks. We couldn't asked for a better flight. That's why we always fly Delta."
Date of travel: November 2019,30,"Friendly staff, but disorganized boarding process","I've flown Delta several times in the past year, and found it to be on par with most average domestic carriers. For the most part, the flights have been ontime, or close to ontime, and service is friendly, but not exceptional. The inflight entertainment system is better than some, and the food choices are average, and on par with other airlines, which admittedly isn't saying much. The only real problem I had is that the boarding process in Orlanda was chaotic and not well organized, which is a situation which I've noticed on other Delta flights. In this instance, there was only one gate attendant, and she seemed a bit overwhelmed by the amount of travelers. All things considered, Delta is a decent domestic carrier, not as bad as some, not as good as the top tier."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,They Have Come a Long Way,"Delta has really come a long way. Perfect staff. I had a 1 stop flight with a 3 hour layover. I didn’t want to worry about my carry on so they put it under the plane to pick up at my final destination for no charge. They have TVs with a very large selection of some of the newest movies, for all ages. Also with music and games for all ages. Amazing snack and drink choices as well. Tight leg room, but mostly every plane is like that. I will definitely fly again."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great flight,"There were no delays, flights on time or even early and staff all pleasant! This was during holiday time so I was very pleased."
Date of travel: October 2019,20,Pay for first class and get service like coach,I paid for and expected to have a first class flight but all I received was coach like service. The plane has no screen so you can watch movies and the Wi-Fi was not working. Not only that they didn't have anything to eat for a vegetarian
Date of travel: November 2019,40,No surprises,We purchased basic economy which permitted carry-on but no checked bags that was OK with us. I am always apprehensive while travelling domestic. This time as well but to my surprise every thing went OK on outbound as well in bound. Everything went well as scheduled and expected. Airline crew was very pleasant and courteous. I am pleased with delta service compare to one major airline that is famous for cancelling flights at the last moment and offer no remedy.
Date of travel: December 2019,10,"""Hot Box!""",As soon as we walked on the plane the heat was uncomfortable.  Even the passenger in the first row seat was fanning himself.  It didn't get better until long after we were in the air.  I don't know what the problem was but the temperature was unbearable!
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Great flight and great customer service,Great service.  I only fly Delta....the best airline in the world.  Always friendly staff and always on-time to my destination.  Atlanta airport although big is very easy to get around and the staff is always willing to assist.  It’s the only airline I fly.
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Delta First Class Is Like No Other,They treat me like a rockstar every time And they have boatloads of personality.  I always ask the Flight Leader & attendants for their first name and thank them for their service!
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Nothing Special,"Okay, you have more room in first class. Didn't seem to us that Delta's version had much more to offer. No ""first class"" treatment waiting for flight. Extremely limited choice on food, and what was available was anything but ""first class"". Service was polite but not warm and certainly not anything special. We were offered a beverage of our choice before takeoff in SF (which we declined, preferring to wait until later) and never offered one again for the duration of the trip. I started flying in the 1960's. What was then called ""tourist"" (now ""economy"" I guess) was better by far than our recent Delta first class flight.  Disappointing."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Very Reliable,"We flight Delta frequently, their customer service is great and their flights on time most of the time. I recomend this airline to my family every time they are planing a trip and almost all of them flight with them."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Satisfied with our choice of Delta for our trip,"All flight segments departed and arrived on time.  We had a connection in Atlanta on our flights from and to Houston and Portland, with a layover of about 50 minutes each time. It was convenient that our gates in Atlanta for arrival and departure were in the same terminal. Service on the flight was good. A word of warning:  If you book the lowest price Economy fare you cannot choose your seat until 72 hours before your flight.  This was a bit of a worry for us since we knew the flights were relatively full. Fortunately we were able to get seats together for all legs. Probably my fault, but I did not notice  this limitation until after booking. Delta flies a number of the older McDonnell Douglas MD series and (to me) these are pretty noisy unless you sit toward the front of the plane."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Quick but good trup,"Had to fly to NY for a funeral of a dear friend. I hadn’t flown Delta in awhile and was pleasantly surprised. They were fast and efficient. Got to destination early, which was so nice. They had decent snacks and drink choices. Best of all the carry on bag was free! That I appreciated very much. Flight attendants were friendly. I would definitely recommend flying Delta"
Date of travel: October 2019,40,"Evel Kneval can get on the plane, I'm getting IN the plane","Having flown several different airlines over the years, they all will charge you for every little thing. This flight wasn't too bad and price was reasonable."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Comfortable Flight,"Seats were comfortable. All of the staff was professional.  We flew home on 09/11 and I was somewhat concerned, but we had no problems. The flights were either on time or early. Good communication from the pilot."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Thanksgiving family trip,"My wife, dog and I flew to PA for Thanksgiving.  We enjoyed Delta Comfort seats and received great service from all of the flight attendants.  We will fly Delta again to Dublin, Ireland in April."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Consistently good service,"Whenever the opportunity arises, we travel Delta. They have proven, to us, to be a consistently excellent form of air travel. Our most recent flight was not only on time, but actually arrived early. We were very pleased."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,"None stop, good service, clean and new equipment. No need for ""1st Class"".","I've flown this trip First Class, which is a bit of a joke on these little planes. But the economy plus is fine. None stop, short trip, good service, new and clean equipment."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Delta & MSP = Great Experience,"I’ve flown out of IND for years, and understand why it continues to get voted one of the top airports year after year.  My favorite airline is Delta, and the staff in IND is awesome.  I really enjoy the IND - MSP flight.  It’s a little over an hour, and the improvements over the past 3 years to MSP have raised it to a new level.  While it is a great place to connect to another leg of a trip, it has to be the easiest large city airport to get in and out of.  While all airlines will have issues, I’ll continue to rely on Delta!"
Date of travel: October 2019,10,Best Flight Ever,Go for the comfort seating on this non stop flight to Vegas. The flight leaves early am. You will get all the snacks that you want plus alcoholic drinks are included with the comfort seating. I felt like I was in first class with out having to pay the price.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,THE FLIGHT ATTENDANTS COULD SMILE AT LEAST ONCE,"The boarding was OK, although they had changed the gate at the last minute at CDG. The overhead bins were all filled so I had to put my carry on in an overhead bin across the fuselage. Not the airline's fault! However, the flight attendants were as if they had been forced to do this job. Very serious! Not even one single smile during the whole flight. Having said that, they did their job professionally."
Date of travel: November 2019,20,"Multiple delays of scheduled flight along, poor recommendations from checkin, terrible first class meal","I was scheduled to leave Denver on Sun, Nov 17 on one of Delta's ""new"" planes, flight 2709.  I started getting messages about delays in the afternoon.  The 7:30 flight was rescheduled to (approx in all cases) 8:30 is then 9:30 is and then after 10 pm - arriving in Seattle at a very late hour.  I was planning to use the light rail in  Seattle and this was too late for me to want to use it -- if I arrived before it closed for the night.  Weather was NOT the issue in Denver or Seattle (sunny and clear in both places).  No reason was given for the delay when I asked.  After the reschedule to after 10 PM on Sunday I feared the flight could be canceled with me sitting at the airport. I rescheduled my fight for the following day (Monday) on Flight 1279.  At the airport on Monday, the gate manager ""Laura"" dressed all in red told me she could do nothing about compensation.  She said Delta usually sends compensation automatically but if I did not hear from them in a week, to call.  When I did call, it took some work on my part to get more than $25.  ""Laura"" also told me while assisting the person checking me in,  that since I was over 2 hrs early, the best food was at a sit down restaurant in A (it was closed, boarded up).  She also told me that the only food on my flight was a 'snack'.  A snack in first class flying over was candy in a basket.  She said I should expect the same on Flt 1279.  In fact the flight served a terrible warm sandwich which included mystery meat, cheese, a rich dressing and something like chicken.  While getting candy in a basket is an insult for a first class flight of two hours, it would have been better than the meal I was served (no choices offered).  The flight itself (on Monday) went well with good flying conditions and attentive flight attendants."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Boston to Dublin Coach Middle Seat,We flew Boston to Dublin arriving in Dublin 8:50 AM.  I never sit in middle seats but somehow I booked a middle in Economy. This was my first flight over the Atlantic and I was afraid that 6 hrs in a middle seat would be unbearable.  I was wrong.  The flight attendants made it not only tolerable but pleasant.  I didn't realize that meals and alcohol would be complimentary even in coach.  Between being catered to by the flight attendants the video entertainment was excellent.  Our checked bags made it through and for the whole trip Delta was on time or early on all 6 legs of the trip.  Thanks Delta.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Flight was late leaving but a good flight anyway.,"The plane was late leaving Las Vegas but the crew and airlines made up for it with excellent service.  Because of the inconvenience, we were given free headsets.  As we got nearer to Detroit, a flight attendant went around and gave everyone their connecting flight number and how to reach your departure gate.  They also asked passengers, who did not have a connecting flight, if they could remain seated so that passengers that had one could deplane first and get to their connecting flights.  If it was feasible, they delayed departure of those flights so that passengers could make their connection to their next destination."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Flight,"Connected through Detroit.  Excellent service I fly delta whenever I have the opportunity.  Even though the day was full of delays due to snow storm, Delta was as efficient as possible getting flights rearranged to get to Las Vegas.   The delta phone app is a must when traveling."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,"Flight, nice as usual, but movie selection was sub par.","Service as expected with Delta:  Nice, Kind, Friendly, Accommodating, but the movie library was sub-par this flight.  It was as if SAG-AFTRA went on strike without any news coverage."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Travel comfortably!,Customer service is superb all throughout the long flight! Very respectful flight attendants. Smooth take-off and landing.
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Terrible flight,"My children are 9 and 11 and DELTA would not put our family together. They wanted us to as passengers to switch seats with us. Unacceptable,  you know their age when we booked! Never DELTA again!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,"terrific, on time and smooth","on time, nice to be on a real airline, and not have to pay for air.  everything was on time and smooth sailing"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,excellent service,Needed extra help getting from flight to flight.  Delta made sure that a wheelchair was available and that an attendant got me to each flight.   Made traveling at large airports much easier
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Went 1st class and had a bad headache due to the a/c which I or the flight attendant could not turn off,The a/c blower above my head could not be turned off and had a bad headache half way Thur the flight due to this.   The flight attendant could not turn it of either
Date of travel: April 2019,40,Head winds and pro-active service,"Ground service, plane, flight crew, etc all OK.  Struck very strong head winds for just about the whole flight.  It eventually became obvious we would not make our connecting flight.  So we expected the usual line up trying to re-book and with possibly a long wait time for a new connecting departure.  First surprise.  Half an hour before landing, the Captain announced that connecting passengers should approach Delta staff in the gate hallway.  Great - no line up at a desk with all and sundry.Second surprise.  The staff member handed us, on Delta letterhead, our new already booked connection.   It was for about the same 2 hour connection time as originally booked. It was also with the competition!  All done before we landed.  The new connecting flight went out full, so I'm very grateful they took a pro-active approach to the missed connection.  One wonders, had we been left to line up in the airport, how long we would have spent in Sydney for a short flight home."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,We flew from Minnesota to Atlanta and then to Aruba,We flew from Minnesota to Atlanta and then on to Aruba....couldn't have had better flight crew or flight! Smooth and comfortable the whole way!
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Terrible airline qualities,"Booked a ticket for myself and my partner, however, we were not seated together on two separate occasions. I would understand if it was booked separately, but on this occasion, we booked it together in hopes that we would be seated side by side. Sadly, this was not the case. In addition to this, we kindly asked one of the air hostess to see whether it was possible to put us together but it was as if she did not try to sort out the issue. Other members of delta also seemed unbothered and failed to contribute to good customer service by choosing NOT to help. Personally, I would never travel with delta AGAIN, as they are not helpful. Save your time and do NOT book with Delta airlines. I’m sure easyJet or Ryanair can do and have done a better job. Delta is the real budget airlines."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Orlando Golf Trip,Very easy check-in process.  Flight was smooth and de-boarding was fast.  Made my overall travel experience very good.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Nice fly,Delta did a good job taking us to Cabo. Newer planes and although we flew economy the seats were comfortable and a decent leg room. I’ll fly again on Delta
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Pretty Close to Perfect,"The team at Delta always earns my recommend. Flying last minute, I was happy to find a seat on Delta out of Boston on such short notice. Any shortcomings of the class (economy this trip) were made up for by the uber-hospitable staff and amenities offered once in flight. Huge props to pilot; Following Boston's recent snow fall the cloud cover was dense, courtesy of the snowfall. Pilot prepared us all for rough air, and yet delivered a smooth flight and a landing we barely felt. Airlines seats being what they are, these were quite comfortable. In flight entertainment choices were plentiful and recent. Coffee is an industry standard, but Delta serves Starbucks coffee, which is a nice plus. As for airlines in general, boarding was far more efficient when loaded planes were from the back."
Date of travel: August 2019,40,Great Service and Good Food Menu without the extras!!!,"My experience with Delta and its partners (AirFrance, Aeromexico, KLM) has been very good.  The website is very transparent and user-friendly.  I enjoyed the extra benefits (SkyMiles Member).  The legroom is enough for me and the flight was on-time and a smooth ride.  The wine selection and the menu offered was tasty and delicious. The service and attention were wonderful as well."
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Night flight to Lima,Flight was fine but the food both ways was terible.  Should take your own if you cant go six hours with out eating
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Reliable Airline,"I've been flying Delta for a long time and the experience has always been very positive. The very long, non stop flight to Beijing, was no exception."
Date of travel: March 2019,50,Delta Airlines Best Flight,I only fly Delta Airlines but they really need to add more Non-Stop flights. Crew are always happy to help passengers.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Overall a very good airline,"We have flown on Delta numerous times and they have pretty much been on time. 2 of our major delays came leaving Baton Rouge for Atlanta (once most of the scheduled flights were 90-12- minutes late out of Atlanta to Baton  Rouge, once a mechanical issue grounded the plane for 8 hours once it arrived in Baton Rouge). A 3rd major delay was following a visit to Atlanta in the summer. Thunderstorms rolled through the Midwest and Atlanta and there were numerous delays. Thankful the pilot educated us about the reasons for the delays and we just had to accept that Mother Nature was in control. An area of weakness is the lack of information given by gate attendants at such times. Passengers were basically rebooking their own flights hoping to make reasonable connections. If you do not have the Delta app, for whatever reason, you are either at the mercy of the gate crew or you have to be assertive and re-book yourself.Once on board the crew is generally efficient. De-boarding can be a bit slow at times. This can be a problem if you have a tight connection. Suggestion leave a 2 hour window in Atlanta for layovers."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Delta/KLM to Amsterdam and back,"great flights and service both to and from.  pleasantly surprised, ALL drinks included, lots of snacks and tons of entertainment, can use your own earbuds."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,"I prefer Delta because they're patriotic and always friendly, least delays or cancels compared to others!","Would be 5 stars if not for lacking pot-able water the first leg of the trip and we weren't informed prior to boarding. Early morning flight and although this trip was just under an hour, you're looking forward to coffee on the flight! I prefer Delta because they're patriotic and always friendly, and they definitely have the least delays or cancellations compared to other major airlines!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Class personified,Customer service is alive and well on Delta. Food was great drinks were plentiful. The only way to fly.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Mechanical problems but awesome crew,"We booked an early flight (5:50 AM ) to connect in Atlanta with a second flight to Daytona Beach. We were delayed until after 7 AM waiting to sort out a minor problem. We sat in our seats waiting. The captain handled it in the best way possible by keeping passengers updated and informed about the delays. Delta worked 8n the background to help people make alternate connections. We actually made it to our next flight with only 5 minutes to spare- luckier than most that day. Other than delays, it was a great flight."
Date of travel: February 2019,50,Delta First Class is Fabulous!,"I have never flown First Class before and decided to treat myself since I was traveling alone for a fun trip to Philadelphia to visit my friend and see the City and Historic Sites. it was only a couple hundred more round trip at the time of year (February).  If I ever get the opportunity to treat myself again while traveling... this will be the way:) The priority boarding, the service, the roomy, comfy seats, the cocktails. I dont travel enough to know, but the whole staff of Delta was very helpful and friendly, also. I would definitely travel Delta and hopefully, one day again.... First Class!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,MSP TO DCA,"We were extremely pleased with everything on this flight, including the preboard staff and onboard crew. The aircraft was clean. Arrival was on time."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Split up,"Terrible,  and the biggest issue is they split people up. Couples and famalies and would not even try to get people together.I talked to several people I heard talking about it it and the more I asked the more people I found were split from the people they were traveling with. We will never use them again and many on our flights said the same."
Date of travel: November 2019,20,Typical Delta Delay,"Flight scheduled to depart @ 12:10...delayed until past 4:30....of course this caused me to miss my connecting flight. Sadly, this is not unusual for Delta."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Great day to fly,We traveled to Costa Rica on delta they always get us there on time and safe. The flight was smooth and the sky was clear you could see the florida coast perfect. Like everyone else I could use a little more leg room. The flight back was just fine cloudy but smooth. Congrats to the flight attendants for dealing with us day in day out.
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Seats Are Like New.,I fly round trip an average of 6 times in a year. I used to love that airline where you have individual t.v.s. Delta does not always have it but their in-flight entertainment are just the same good. Their seats are comfortable and like new. I had 3 trips this year with Delta and their seats are all like new. I am comfortable. It is not easy to be comfortable on airplanes especially for Economy class but not with Delta. I know that Boeing and Airbus are different plane manufacturers but I believe Delta pays attention to its passengers more than others. The prices are just the same with other airlines. It is a matter of when you make your purchase.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Enjoyed my flight,"I noticed from the gate the Delta was a better airline.  The uniforms for the flight staff were very neat and professional.  The cabin had great seating that made you feel like an individual. I could bend down and grab my bag underneath the seats, meaning plenty of leg room.  The seats were comfortable and reclined without being in someones lap.  I had room to move.  The flight attendants and staff were friendly, and  in comparison, I would try to fly Delta more often."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Smooth flight during stormy weather!,"We were relieved to have such a flight over the Sierra Nevada Mountains during the recent snow storm! The crew was very professional and friendly, as usual."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Very reliable,I fly to Buffalo frequently.  I usually choose Delta.  The flights are usually on time.  Delta usually hase the most convienient flight times.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"In between three storms, not a minute delay.  So amazing.  Airlines do try to get their passengers to their destinations",Flights from Asheville NC to Atlanta to Las Vegas & return.  Not a minute late during the whole round trip.  Amazing !!
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Good trip I was upgraded to First Class on the trip,Since I was a Medallion member I was upraded tp First Class on this trip.  I was given  two Kind bars for my snack.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,happy customers,"We were very impressed by the customer service,friendly staff,meal and snacks were plentiful and satisfactory.very comfortable.being frequent flyers,was our first time with this airline,will definitely fly with them again.,enjoyed the night pack and warm washcloths.wow"
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Know before you “Go!” Airbus 320 Tiny Restroom.,"The restrooms on this plane are in the rear for non first class passengers. At 5’ and 105 lbs, I could barely sit on the toilet seat and turning to the tiny sink was awkward. I was wearing flexible clothing (leggings and a tunic) so I can hardly imagine being dressed in business clothing on this flight. What do people 5’ 6” do?Waiting for available restroom after long turbulence was also awkward. There is minuscule space for flight attendants and those in line for these services."
Date of travel: November 2019,20,Flights on points!,"The customer service representative at the three airports that we had contact with were all professional and helpful. Booked flights with points. My wife and I were not seated together ( we have separate rewards accounts) on any of our flights.Seats were in the back of the plane, right by toilets! Make sure you upgrade your seats ( which you'll pay for) so you will have an assigned seat prior to arriving at the airport, Connecting flight was a nightmare in Detroit. Ending up sleeping in the airport. The pilots fly time, timed out while we were out on the tarmac for over two hours waiting to de-ice, ( 2:00 am) so they weren't able to get us to our final destination city.  Bad experience! Our other two returning flights were just average, May not fly Delta again!"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Atlanta to Frankfurt,"I just got back two days ago from my monthly trip to Europe for business. The trip over was nice and uneventful. On the trip back the restroom in business class ran out of water - unbelievable for any airline to do that, but really surprised in business on Delta. 4M miles on this airline and this was the first time I have seen that."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Delta LA to New Orleans and back,"I flew to /from LAX to New Orleans for a cruise during Thanksgiving Week. All things considered both flights on time, good pilots and crew. I'm not a big fan of LAX sadly the security people are often rude and not helpful. Nicer in New Orleans obviously.  I don't like paying for bags checked $30 a pop but I guess it could be worse.  And getting dropped off and picked up at LAX was better than I thought so overall a nice trip."
Date of travel: July 2019,50,Great service,Great service.Airline staff excellent and hlpefull.Planes clean and tidy.On board entertainment greatOn Time
Date of travel: October 2019,40,ATLANTA TO CHINA,Delta has been working on improving their service to Asia. The suite upgrades in business class are a wonderful addition.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Professional and seamless service,Elbow to elbow people in the airport and a completely full flight but all the employees at Delta handled themselves professionally - ensuring an orderly and timely boarding and on time take off.  Excellent job - as usual. Worth e dry penny to fly Delta
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Delta Delivers,"Usually, I do not like flying from New York,  but this late flight was a delightful Delta surprise... new plane, upgraded seats, and a sweet staff.  I think the key was the late flight, not completely full, and not a peak time...try it."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Service was great,"Everything from the booking of the flight, to check in and on board was great. I was able to log onto delta.com, find flights for the dates I was looking to travel, book it, get my confirmation. A day before the departure date, i checked in online and get my boarding pass added to my Apple Wallet. On the day of the travel, flight was on time, the service on board was good. The staff were friendly and accommodating. The flight arrived on time as well. The return flight was equally as good. I would recommend Delta"
Date of travel: January 2019,30,Not worth the extra fare,"I've usually traveled economy class on several diffent airlines, figuring that I'd put up with a short period of less-than-pampered conditions in order to splurge at my destination.  Last time I flew Delta my husband decided to treat me to an upgraded ticket to First Class.  Sure, the seats were wider, the service was great and I had complimentary wine with my meal.  But the meal itself was quite disappointing, hardly enough to count as a ""meal"" and not a ""glorified snack.""  For example, on Quantas Air Line, the economy class meal was a =real= meal  (choice of two good entrees)  and not only was the service excellent, but the following morning's hot breakfast was just as good.  Somehow, I had expected a domestic (Delta) airline to have at least measured up to their standards.  I'll just stock up on a simple snack and won't mind paying for a glass of wine if I don't get a soft drink next time I fly.  It definitely will be economy class because I just didn't think the price difference was worth it.  Due to my connecting flight(s) I was not able to avail myself of the airport lounge."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Consistent Performance,Nothing stood out as outstanding but no issues either. Snacks were okay. Overall flight was good but routine.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,NEW MEXICO,"The flight was on time, workers were friendly and polite, service was good...had no complaints.  I really liked the screen on the back of the chair in front and the games provided and watching as the trip went across the country.  Interesting."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Delta More Roomy,"We boarded Delta Airlines on time, cool, comfortable and relaxing flight back from a perfect vacation!  I found the seating was roomier than most airlines.  In the future I highly recommend flying this Airline!"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Flight from CHA via ATL to London Heathrow,"Great flight! Wonderful attentive flight crew, comfortable seats and flawless flight! Food was plentiful and good."
Date of travel: July 2019,40,no stop to minneapolis,Having a direct flight from Seoul to MInneapolis is amazing. I travel from Korea to Minnesota once or twice a year and I used to have to go to Detroit which was super annoying. I hope they keep this route going.
n/a,50,Top! ,"So far Delta seems to top other airlines flying out of SKB. Checking was seamless, flight was great and we landed ahead of time. Staff are friendly and helpful. If they were the cheaper option I would try fly them all the time."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Trip experiences.,It was fabulous and very enjoyable.  The flight crew was very efficient and courteous.  We are planning our next trip and plan to fly Delta.  Our stay in Hawaii was very enjoyable!
Date of travel: June 2019,20,Premium Economy is really only economy,This was promoted as Premium Economy but it wasn't.    Couldn't sleep much because I got a sore bum from the hard small seat.  Customer service was fair and the entertainment system was OK.  Headsets weren't very good.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Tokyo to LAX,"We had good service throughout a long day of flying, good food, lots of movies to choose from, Richard, a 40 yr employee was the best steward we ve had in years, funny, attentive, never stopped checking his cabin.  Premium economy seating  was comfortable for a ten hour flight"
Date of travel: December 2019,30,economy is basically stand by,"I recently flew from key west to Phila with my wife, booked my trip through aarp/ Expedia as I have in the past. Delta does not assign seat till the gate, we had a connecting flight through Atlanta that did not give us enough time to be at the gate to have seats assigned close together. 10 rows apart. I will think twice about using Delta as a carrier when selecting flights as part of my package deal. Other than that, smooth early arriving flights"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Very pleased!,What I like the most is the flight schedule. You fly out in the morning from the Philippines and arrive in Seattle early morning which avoids jetlag. It’s as if you just slept overnight. On your way back home to Philippines you leave in the morning in Seattle and arrives in the evening. So sleep pattern is not that disturbed. Plus the layover is just 2hrs in Narita which is very convenient. The plane is brand new and service is excellent.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Last minute flight due to being stranded by Spirit,Good experience in general. Gate agent in Fort Lauderdale was not pleasant at all. We were last minute due to late arrival and only a short time between connections. She was very rude and acted like it was our fault.My daughter and son in law had paid for upgraded seats for more room but were put in back of the plane because the gate agents had given their seats away. Delta was very good about refunding them for the upgrades and apologetic for the experience.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Delta to New York,"Our flight from Atlanta to Newark on Delta was excellent. From baggage check to check in, to the plane ride went very well. The flight was turbulent but the pilot kept us informed regularly. In addition,we actually arrived early. Couldn't have been more pleased!"
Date of travel: February 2019,50,American Service,"This may not be the flashiest of airlines, but value for money and customer care and service, both in Australia and USA, is fantastic! Things we do not see from Australian airlines.The cost of a return flight is also the best around. Food is airline food, but better than most. Crew are very helpful also, both on the ground and in the air.My only way to fly to and around America.Thank you Delta Air Lines."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,My flight,Delta in my opinion was perfectFlying out we were delayed but pilot was able to still get us there on timeWhen leaving lax there was also a delay but once again pilot made up and got us home also on timeBoth incidents were not fault of delta
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Don’t Bother Paying for First Class—You can’t use the Clubs!,"So we paid $1800 each to fly first class to Quito through Atlanta.  We were able to use the Club in DC, but when we got to Atlanta, we were told we couldn’t use the club because we were flying to Quito?  WTF!  We didn’t have any club access in Quito as their lounge wasn’t for Delta customers.  Then we were told we couldn’t use the club on our way back through Atlanta because it was a domestic flight.  The service during the flight was so so.  The food was pedestrian and the service meh.  We will never pay to upgrade on Delta again and will always try book an international carrier."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,A very smooth flight,I did not feel like an economy traveler on this flight. The service and attention to detail was wonderful. The flight itself was smooth and on time. I will definitely fly Delta International again.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Home For Thanksgiving!,"Holiday time is hectic time at airports and not much fun. Round trip, 4 flight legs and only one minor delay. Kudos to Delta. Professional employees, keep you informed and updated."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Flight to Seattle from RDU and Return,Prefer the nonstop flight from RDU to SEA whenever I can get a seat.  Delta staff go above and beyond to make sure you are comfortable.
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Fair,"Well, I have to admit that it is not the same as months ago. They are declining in quality of service. I’m a AMEX platinum Delta members , not receiving what I was offered."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"Smooth, comfortable, ahead of schedule","Comfortable transatlantic flight. Flight left early and arrived early (think they bake in a cushion of time in their published flight times to avoid late departure or arrival).  Arrival ahead of schedule is welcome when making a connection in AMS Schipol with the loooong walk from International arrival terminal to Inta-Europe ""domestic"" terminal. Flight crew was excellent.  Service was smooth and friendly. Although the B767 is not my favorite airplane, being in Comfort+ made a world of difference."
Date of travel: May 2019,40,Peru Trip,The Delta fights round trip was on time or some arrived a little early. The flight attendantswere very nice and helpful and the food was very good. Since we were on the long flights they also serve snacks. My only issue are the legs space. We always fly Delta when possible even the one when went to London.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Tough to beat,"Delta is huge but manages to operate with more focus on the customer than the other giants like United and American.  Seat leg room was good and the extra price for that room ranks as a great deal for tall folks.  Service was good, food was typical for coach , which is to say fair at best. The Delta cabin attendants actually seem to enjoy their job and what a difference that makes to the customer experience."
Date of travel: August 2019,10,Terrible service after delay,"Due to a thunderstorm the already delayed flight (maintenance problem) couldn't land at MSP, so we went to Sioux Falls, South Dakota. After more than two hours in the plane after landing, without any dood ie water we could finally leave the plane. At Sioux Falls airfield was... Nothing. A small kiosk that was quote empty because of some earlier unexpected visitors that afternoon. First we were informed we'd leave in about an hour and the last fifteen minutes took 90 minutes. Instead of 5 pm (time after delay at SFO) we finally landed on MSP at 11 om. We missed our connecting flight tot Amsterdam, so we needed a place to stay for the night. Delta had no rooms legt at partner hotels, so we should arrange something ourselves, or stay at the airport. Our suitcases weren't available, so no fresh vlotjes and nobody from the Delta crew that even bothered a bit about out situation. We'll never fly with Delta again."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Great flight and easy to change flights In Chicago.,"Great service, good food and comfortable to stretch out and sleep The food was a lot better than I anticipated, also I like a lot of water and received plenty of it. Great selection on movies, news and tv series to watch."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Family catchup,"The service they provided was very good, staff were lovely, good choice of entertainment, meals were ok. I like that you don't have to pay for every drink when you are thirsty"
Date of travel: November 2019,30,BUF-MSP-HND-LAX-DTW-BUF,"I'm reviewing the whole Start  to Finish journey, and will mention different aspects of the flights, as there are points to consider.Buffalo and Delta is not the best combination.  They have more flights scheduled than they have gates available, which seems to mean that unless you're lucky, you're going to be delayed, coming or going.  Our outbound flight was late departing, and the actual gate assignment not certain till the last minute.  Upon return to Buffalo, we were a good 20 minutes early, on the ground, and a solid 1/2 hour late (to the scheduled time) to actually get onto a gate.  This is a major hassle, especially if you've been flying thru 14 time zones!  This aspect alone costs Delta at least one rating (from Very Good to Average)The Lounge in MSP (no lounges in Buffalo) was excellent and conveniently located for the departure.  MSP can be a BIG airport if you come in at one end and go out the other.  In this trip, I walked it as I need the exercise, and had the time.  On tighter connections, I hop on one of their golf-cart shuttles.MSP to HND is about 12 1/2 hours.  The lay-flat seating in Delta's business class is, I think, well worth the premium.  (and it isn't cheap!).  Excellent cabin service, good food, and I take an Ambien and sleep 8 hours of the 12.  Arriving at Haneda is fairly simple.  A perhaps five minute walk from the gate to the passport clearance line, and since we were lucky and slightly in front of a couple other arriving flights, our lines were not terribly long.  My luggage was coming down the ramp within five minutes of clearing passports.  There is a ""metro"" line from HND terminal to Shinagawa station, I recommend this over a taxi; from Shinagawa you can get anywhere.   Look for the KEIKYU line, you'll need to purchase a PASMO metro-pass card (500Yen I think, for the empty card, put at least 1000 yen on the card after purchase, the fare to Sninagawa is about 480yen).  There is an alternate metro-card, SUICA, useful on the JR lines.  I'm told you can use either card on any of the lines but I did not try, as I have both cards.  Returning to Haneda is again by the Keikyu line, about a 20 minute ride.  Get off at the INTERNATIONAL Terminal.  Delta did not have any open check-in access when I arrived.  It would be NICE of Delta to note the opening time for Check-in when they email you to remind you to check-in on line.  I'd have enjoyed another hour of leisure at my hotel.  By the time the check-in and baggage drop stations were open, at least 100 people were queuing.  Delta uses a common lounge, which was OK.  Nothing special, just OK.  Boarding for the LAX flight was prompt and efficient, and the lay flat bed and ambien had me asleep till we were about 75 minutes out of LAX.  What I especially appreciate about flying Business Class is that I can ask the flight attendant to make sure I'm awake when they start serving breakfast coffee; I need that morning kick after an overnight flight.  Delta's flight attendants are among the BEST in the industry, by the way.Clearing passports and customs in LAX is easy (forget Arlo Gutheie's song) ;). Connecting in LAX was also fairly easy, I needed a good walk anyway, and had plenty of time.   The Delta lounge is always busy, in cycles, as people arrive and depart.LAX - DTW in 1st Class is predictably nice, and the Sky Club in DTW is one of my favorites.   By the time we were boarding for BUF, I was TIRED!  Dead Tired, I put my head back after getting into my seat and thought ""I'll close my eyes till they do the safety announcements"". Next thing I new, we were hearing the Prepare for Landing in Buffalo announcement.   As I mentioned, we were early AND LATE into Buffalo.Still, flying Delta beats any of the domestic competition!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,"Uneventful, which is a good thing","I was able to get a reasonable oneway ticket last minute on a holiday weekend.  Got lucky, I guess. No problems."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Comfortable flight,"The premium economy on Delta was very comfortable. Other than having to transfer in Atlanta, the flight was wonderful."
Date of travel: June 2019,30,Inconsistent at best,"I used to be a big fan of Delta until they left me stranded alone, in ATL overnight, without warning last summer. Subsequent flights (2) were generic and mediocre, but both were unable to fulfill the promise of drinks (all types, including water) for each leg of the journey. I am hoping the next flight surpasses my expectations."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Flight to first ski trip of the 2019/20 season.,"With a fully booked flight, the ground crew and flight crew, conducted an on-time departure. Winter is a particularly challenging time for flight travel. Not only are the passengers carrying all their earthly possessions as carry-on, but that includes heavy winter clothing, etc., certainly putting a strain on the overhead bin and under seat storage. Also, the flight enjoyed the company of many young fliers (under 2).  Parents and children arrived at the gate with 4+ single and tandem strollers, all which were taking by the ground crew and stowed for the flight. Further, two passengers arrived in wheel chairs requiring special assistance to board the plane safely.  Given all that was going, I, my bags, including “oversized” skis, made on on time departure and a slightly early arrival in Denver to begin a week long ski vacation at Keystone.😀"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Long flight done well!,Had a great vacation doing a cruise through ports of Europe for a week and knew we'd have to deal with a long flight home.  Pleasently surprised with the room and comfort provided. We flew out just after noon and not long after reaching cruising altitude we were provided with a meal.  Later in the flight there were snacks and a light meal.  Attendants were all friendly and helpful and that means a lot when you're in the air for over 10 hours and passing through 6 times zones. The only negative for myself was that the screen on the headrest would freeze up. The were able to reset it once so I did get to pass some time watching a movie but after it went out a second time it made the rest of the flight pretty boring.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Delta Continues to Provide Great Service,"Very comfortable flight, short but not rushed. The flight crew was very pleasant and helpful. We were at the end of a 12 hour journey home and this was the most comfortable of the day with pleasant people who actually acted like they liked their job."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Easy to relax,"It's a small plane, but regularly on time each way for several years now when I visit family. And the HPN airport is efficient, with a small town friendliness that is pleasantly surprising. Good food in the diner, too!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Holiday flights,"We have flown with Delta a couple of times now, and each time their customer service is exemplary.We flew from Edinburgh to JFK, then JFK to Orlando, their assistance team is brilliant, pick you up at the door of the aircraft, take you through immigration, pick up your cases, through customs and finally onto your next gate. They are very attentive, make sure your ok. This was the first time I had the need to use this service, I would recommend it only if you really need it.The food, for aviation food, was nice, but then again I'm not a big fan of aviation food.The Delta cabin crew are fantastic, they can't do enough for you. We accidentally left the feet to my grandsons wheel chair on the plane, we realised at our next gate as we'd decided not to reattach them, as we were soon to go on another flight. The Delta staf went above and beyond to get the feet too us, they finally arrive at our resort in Orlando.Would recommend Delta? Yes I certainly would."
Date of travel: January 2019,10,Destroyed bags and contents,"We had a connecting flight from Atlanta to Dublin and arrived at the gate just in time (due to our previous Delta flight being late). Nonetheless, the agent sold our tickets to standby passengers right in front of our face - almost like some weird act of defiance. Our bags were taken off the flight and evidently thrown about the place in the rain, as 2 of our brand new cases were scuffed, 2 other cases were ripped and the contents wet and damaged. I tried to submit a claim and was told that it could take weeks or months. When I called again for an update, I was told that there was no such claim."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Both ways perfect,"Round trip was early getting in both times. Friendly and efficient staff at checkin, security, gates, in flight, luggage"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,RELAXING EXPERIENCE,"This was my first time flying on Delta Airlines, and I was very pleased on both flights. The staff was very nice and courteous, the plane was kept clean and free of odor, just enough leg room, really yummy snacks ( rather than just typical pretzels) and although it doesn't seem like a big deal, sometimes during flights it really comes in handy! The best part however, was free tv/ movies to watch for your entire flight."
Date of travel: June 2019,10,"Delays, missed flight, no room for carry on","I got to the airport in St Louis and checked in with no problems. After getting through security, I settled down to wait for my flight to Atlanta so I could catch another flight from there to Tallahassee. We were then told that the flight out of St Louis would be delayed for 1 1/2 hours. What was supposed to be a two hour layover in Atlanta was then only a 30 minute one. I went to the counter expressing my concern about catching my connecting flight. I was assured that I could make it in time. After arriving in Atlanta and running as fast as I could, guess what- I didn’t make it. My luggage, in the meantime, was on its way to Tallahassee without me. After I found someone at Delta to help me, I was able to get on another flight that was two hours later. They did call Tallahassee and had them hold my bag for me. Once I arrived I was able to find the office and retrieve my luggage. I feel like Delta could have been better at letting everyone know their options better and quicker"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Flying Entertainment,"I know a 15 hour flight doesn’t sound like something worth reviewing, long cramped and sleeplessness hours await, but to the contrary the seats were as accommodating as they could be, the staff was amazing and the food better than anticipated!!! The entertainment options are enough to keep one occupied free messaging on WiFi is sometimes hit or miss but the fact that it’s free I have no complaints, the paid in flight  WiFi was serviceable . All in all if your flying long distance Delta does it right !!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Delta has always been a pleasure to travel through.,I have always had an enjoyable trip when I used Delta. It never mattered what seat or class. Knock-Knock.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Trip to Miami,Delta Airlines is great to work with!  Very helpful and kind. Everyone was very courteous and pleasant!
Date of travel: October 2019,50,"a great service and proffesional service by attendants and pilots, felt like flying in the previous Century.","starting with boarding and service in the flights I felt confortable and well taken care of,  am really greatfull for the treatment and the the flight."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,"Excellent experience, with just a minor exception.","We fly Delta whenever possible. For a flight to Amsterdam and a subsequent cruise up the Rhine/Moselle rivers to Basle, we splurged on Delta One (the ""bed seats"", which we had booked once before). It is certainly a very relaxing and comfortable experience, with all the amenities one expects for the price. The ""minor exception"" mentioned above is actually two points: the food, while satisfactory, wasn't up to previous standards; and surprisingly, the cabin crew, while polite, were much less friendly than on previous Delta flights in any class. Maybe it was just an off-day. In any case, we will continue to fly Delta."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,A very pleasant snooze after a long week eating Korean barbeque,"Delta's flagship non-stop A350 from Seoul to Atlanta was terrific, i.e., safe and on time. We were in business class and got in a heavy 40 winks in the wrap-around ""cocoon"" seats/sleepers - cabin crew was very professional and did not bother us with distractions. Did not use entertainment system, but it seemed quite nice. Overall, Delta's business class is superior to KAL, primarily because of seat confort."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Travel from San San Antonio with a connection through Mexico City to Leon BJX,We traveled Delta over Thanksgiving 11/22 with return on 12/2. All flights were on time! Service was great. Planes were clean and not overcrowded. Checked-in 2 hours prior to each flight. Connections were smooth.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Next time I will buy direct from airlines,"Great trip thanks to Matt this morning at 5:40 am in Fargo,MSP waited the 3 minutes for us to board from Fargo flight. We did have snowstorm in Fargo and msp.Baggage was on a different plane because of short time to board. Dennis in Newark Delta Baggage was waiting for us and is delivering later tonight at no cost to DC hotel in NYC.  Should know we purchased ticket from Just fly a division of Globus, NEVER AGAIN, we paid for 1st class all the way and received only problems ,like no seat assignments ,1st and 4th legs at economy,2nd longer leg did get our first class, third  leg on 20th December not sure yet. 4th leg upgraded to first for another $400.bottom line if you go with internet service from JUST_FLY and other 3rd party vendors you leave yourself open to a lot of frustrating time dealing with the above. Buy from your airline and wait for specials. Vbl"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Outstanding Economy Comfort Plus Experience,"I chose Delta Air Lines Madrid/Philadelphia (via Atlanta) to avoid JFK in New York.  This was an outstanding choice,  Passing through security in Madrid was easy and quick.  I had plenty of time to take a look at the fine selection of duty-free shops before heading to the boarding gate.  Boarding was efficiently and courteously carried out for an on-time departure.  Delta's Economy Comfort Plus product is outstanding.  For not much more than regular economy class, I received an upgraded, and comfortable, seat with plenty of leg room. After departure, the cabin crew handed out menus detailing the meal choices available and what meal services could be expected, which is a very nice touch. The crew on this flight was highly professional and very friendly. Service began with snacks and a beverage.  I had requested a special diabetic meal.  It was delicious, well prepared, and served nice and hot.  Much better than most airline catering.  Afterward, the crew came around with bottles of water, which is another nice touch.  About 2 hours or so later, the crew served ice cream and packages of Delta's famous cookies.  An hour or so before arrival in Atlanta. a hot snack was served.  In my case it was a delicious vegetarian hot wrap sandwich.  Also, the crew had a basket of snacks and beverages available in the galley throughout the flight.  Delta should be complimented for the quality of their in-flight service on International flights.  Going through Passport Control and Customs in Atlanta was easy and efficient, especially the automated Customs clearance.  My bags were on their way to the connection to Philadelphia. and I was on my way to the departure terminal in just about an hour,  I had time for a snack before boarding the flight to Philadelphia, and this was also an on-time departure.  Even though it was a short 90 minute flight, the friendly crew served beverages and a snack basket including more packages of Delta's famous cookies.  This was an outstanding experience and I'll certainly choose Delta again next time."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Delta Airlines is the USA's quality carrier.,"I highly prefer Delta because it seems to be the smoothest esperience.  I fly 40 or so flights a year and find Delta employees at every level smiling, willing to help when there's a problem, and provide a pleasant flying experience.  Today, Delta is the class act among major US carriers.  They might charge a few dollars more but it's worth it to me.  From check in to baggage claim no one takes better care of you than Delta if you ask me.  I also have their American Express card which gives me free baggage.  I'm also a lifetime Skyclub member - you might call me a Delta fan."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Visiting,Great flight wonderful customer service. The new terminal in New York will be beautiful once finished. Right now there are more seats in the food court than for passengers just waiting.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,full,"flight was delayed but reached on time, full flight to New York, recommend night flight because children will be sleeping and you can enjoy a movie, reading or just napping"
Date of travel: October 2019,40,International Business Class was a good experience. Domestic - not so much.,"Good service and meals. The 767 was showing it's age, but did the job. Flight attendants were top notch."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Typical flight to Orlando,"As usual on most airlines, the boarding process by class of seat seems inefficient but the flight took on Flight left and arrived on time. It was very full (as are most flights to/from Orlando) but service was efficient."
n/a,20,Take a carry on,"I've flown delta twice this year, both international, and both times have had my bag damaged. While their service on most occasions is good, if you can't afford to buy new luggage after every trip you take, I would recommend limiting yourself to a carry on or choose a different airline."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"CROSS COUNTRY TO VANCOUVER, WA","Delta's amenities were a plus; wi-fi, movies etc. However, seating was uncomfortable and cramped.  When seat ahead of me pushed back, my tray table was a few inches away from my chest.  Offers of snacks were pitiful.  For a 6am flight one would think coffee would be served....wrong!I requested a window seat, but not every seat has a window"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,"Comfortable if there are not 3 people in the row.  Otherwise, it's cramped.","Flight attendants were great.  Comfortable, but not if there's a person in the middle seat.  Flight was on time both ways."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Quick NY weekend,"My flight to NY was very quick and easy, thankfully with no delays. It was a relatively smooth flight. Flight attendants did there jobs of serving drinks and snacks but I didn’t take anything as I like to rest on these short flights especially having been up so early for a 6 am flight. Delta is my preference for this trip. I checked in two bags with no problems and I was able to have my carry on piece stored and delivered at the bridge when I got off the flight. Good airline and I recommend it"
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Great Trip!,Perfect Flight and staff was awesome! Traveled with my young daughter and it was here first time and it couldn't have been better :)
Date of travel: October 2019,50,OUTSTANDING SERVICE FROM CHECK IN TO DESTINATION.,"There are many airlines to choose from. If your going to fly the best, I chose Delta every time!Check in process goes quickly. When I was dropped off at the curb side check in. The check in person said that because I was changing planes at JFK and going International, that my  luggage needed special handling for international flights. He said that he would take my baggage to the front check in baggage  counter and not to worry as it would be tagged and   boarded on the flight to London.Picked up my bags as promised  on arrival London baggage claim.."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Delta handled every nuance,"By and large this trip was one of the finest travel experiences that I have ever had. Delta's website was a well thought out site and made for and exceptionally comfortable booking process. Aw well, having the Delta iphone app. was a worthy friend. The were timely updates via this app. and this made all of the difference. The Delta staff both on the ground and in the air were well seasoned and knowledgable of what it takes to make one comfortable during the hectic process of traveling."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,"Dependable flights in and out of Melbourne, FL to Atlanta","I often take Delta flights to Atlanta from Melbourne, FL. It is well worth the extra cost NOT to have to drive to Orlando and fight the crowds in that very busy airport. While Delta is reliable, I do wish they would not charge for luggage. This forces most people to carry on bags and then slows the boarding process. In addition, they often run out of overhead bin space and then Delta complementary checks the bags. WHY NOT LET PEOPLE CHECK THE BAGS FOR FREE IN THE FIRST PLACE????"
Date of travel: August 2019,30,Friendly service but gates worse!,Delta service were very friendly.  But I was tired of walking around the gates three times.   I did not know why Delta changed the gales three times.  Good thing! I did not miss my flight.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Excellent,"Excellent direct flight from PDX to Europe.  Service was outstanding, frequent meals, comfy seats even inthe back!"
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Rude Female Flight Attendant,"Generally I really like flying with DELTA, but this particular flight left me feeling stupid and embarrassed by a flight attendant. Apparently there is a protocol that no passengers are aloud up near the front bathrooms when a pilot is coming out of the cockpit. That’s completely understandable after 9/11. However, no announcement was made that that was happening, and at the same time I needed the restroom unbeknownst that the pilot just exited the cockpit. So as I approached the bathrooms, the female flight attendant abruptly puts up her hand and loudly says, “STOP! You can’t enter this area” Confused as to the reason (I’m thinking maybe I can’t use the one by first class), I decide to at least try and hand her my empty pop can and cup, so I can at least get rid of that. Again, with no explanation and DRAWN HAND IN THE AIR, she just says “Stop! Don’t enter here”. So after being treated like a criminal twice, I head to the back of the plane, use the bathroom, and return to my seat. After a while they come by with more drinks, and she sees I’m annoyed with her. She asks if I’m the one who came to the front. I affirm I was. She THEN explains why I couldn’t come up front. REALLY?!? Why couldn’t she have politely explained it while I’m standing in front of all the passengers up front at the time?? I would have completely complied and not be made to feel stupid. I understand protocol, but give passengers a heads up, or KINDLY explain as they approach at an inopportune time. THAT COULD HAVE BEEN TALEN CARE OF MUCH MORE PROFESSIONALLY, with some explaining  AND RESPECT FOR THE PASSENGER!!! #deltadisrespect"
Date of travel: December 2019,10,No money back,"had to cancel a $341. flight two weeks ahead of the flight. They gave me back $50. Delta Airlines, how about 'Screw you airlines""!"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,On time means a lot to me!,"We recently flew on Delta to Atlanta and then on to Ft. Lauderdale.  On both flights, we loaded, departed, and arrived on time or ahead of time.  When you are trying to get someplace, it means a lot to be able to make your flights and connecting flights on time.  Service was also very nice and the plane was clean.  Returning on another airline, both flights were late and it made it difficult to get from one flight to the next on time, leaving no time to catch a a bite to eat between flights and very late getting home."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Delta is the best to Milan!,We had an excellent trip to Milan on Delta.  The AirBus plane is comfortable and has enough overhead baggage for easy access.  Food was alright; movies were poor.  Good for sleep...
Date of travel: October 2019,30,I couldn't sleep at all on over night flight.,"Flight duration was 11 pm to 6:45 am. I took shower and had 1 glass of red wine at lounge to sleep on flight. But 1 teenager boy keep ... shouting crying..during whole flights. I had ear plugs but doesn't help. Terrible experience. If I believe, the boy should take some sleeping pills, is it really bad idea? I don't know what I can blame.. It ruined whole schedule for next day."
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Small Airplane,"I flew from SYR-JFK on a tiny Delta CRJ-200! The plane was super claustrophobic and totally full! We had no drink service on this quick 50 minute flight! I was a little disappointed in that, because I had flown on the same route before on JetBlue! JetBlue uses a plane double that size and still did a drink service! The flight attendant was friendly, but not overly friendly! The plane was clean and on time though! It was the JFK flight around noon! Most of the noon Delta flights to JFK from SYR use the CRJ-200! So if you had the choice to pick a different time, you may have a different type of aircraft! Aka a better/bigger plane!"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Mexico - New York -Thanksgiving Day,"Hostesses very kind and amiable, and everything ewas fine except that I had asked for a window seat (like always) and I wwas given seat A, but there was no window at that place."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"Seemless, ontime, not terribly uncomfortable","Planes were on time, reasonably comfortable, Flight Attendants were gracious and helpful. Check-in was easy."
Date of travel: September 2019,10,Won't ever use again,"In September of this year, using my SkyMiles, booked a short, short trip between PHX and RNO.  Not only could I NOT get a non-stop flight between adjoining states, but my 2nd connection flight was delayed by 4 hours.  No weather issues, just mechanical failure of the plane coming in.  During those 4 hours, 2 flights came/went from our gate.  Really Delta?  You should be using THOSE planes to accommodate the delayed flight passengers.  Totally ridiculous.  Free flight between 2 states that took 8 hours.  Never, never, never again.."
Date of travel: November 2019,30,"Almonds, lots of almonds","Almonds, lots of almondsdon't get to the airport early because the counter won't be open in Austin or Aruba til 1.5-2 hours outin-flight entertainment spotty at bestreboot didn't take"
Date of travel: July 2019,30,Delays into the late night!,Flight up to Milwaukee was uneventful BUT the return trip was not!!I was to arrive in Atlanta around 7pm...landed at 1am!! Not a great trip home!!
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Reliable,"ALWAYS always always take Delta through Atlanta. They will never leave you there....they will always find back-up crew, planes...despite ATL being the busiest airport in the world, it is run well. This was a great flight but I always have good luck flying through Atlanta."
Date of travel: July 2019,30,So Cramped Even I Had No Leg Room,"I fly on Embraers all the time, usually on Southwest or United, and I have never been in such a cramped cabin.  This plane had wide ""normal"" seats in the business section (which I've not seen on an Embraer before) which narrowed the aisle making it nearly impossible to pass with a carry on bag.  Frankly, it made it nearly impossible to pass even if you are empty handed.  Once past the bottle neck created by the large seats, it seemed as though the rest of the seats were even closer together than usual so that, at just over 5', I had very little leg room. I can't imagine how taller people manage to sit for the length of even a short flight on these planes. The economy seats themselves also seemed even narrower than those on Southwest or United flights that I've taken. Other than the extremely uncomfortable seat, it was a normal flight.  No outstanding delays and it was a direct flight which was nice."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Comfortable and easy,Seven hour flight very relaxing attentive crew excellent food  and drink .. movies tv audiobooks would fly again
Date of travel: November 2019,50,A good airline,Delta offers a number of flights to Buffalo - most through Detroit.The Grand Rapids airtport is small and esy to get around.   Delta Comfort provides extra leg room and that is nice.  First Class is an even better upgrade and often not that much extra.  With First Class you get two checked bags and prefered boarding.   The 2 bags almost pays for the additional cost.In addition you get a larger seat and more leg room - and as my son will point out (he loves flying Delta first Class) - free drinks!Many good choices on times and good service.   Our last flight was booked last minute and was very affordable and easy to do.   We were even able to use some Delta miles to reduce the cost - first time ever able to do that.
Date of travel: October 2019,40,"Non-stop from PDX to Narita, Japan","The non-stop flight from PDX to Narita was a decent flight.  It was approximately 11 hours with a welcome drink, many choices of other drinks, dinner and breakfast with a snack mid-way.  We were able to put two suitcases under.  I think that helps the crowded binds a great deal.  The seats are too tight and there is a stop for how far the seat in front of you can recline."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Tel Aviv to JFK,Very long flight but everything went smoothly.  Crew was pleasant and accommodating.  Great service by everyone and will fly Delta again.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Comfort Plus is the way to go,"It was my first time flying Comfort +, I would highly recommend the comfort plus for the legroom alone. the snacks are better and the drinks are included."
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Business meeting/pleasure,Flight experience could have been better. Food was just ok.  Flight was diverted. We sat for hours on the tarmac of a different airport until we flew back to SFO.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Delta is very professional,"First, I got upgraded!  That always makes for a nicer flight.  People in first class are not as friendly as people in coach but I'll take the wider seat and meal service over chatting with a stranger.  The best thing I like about Delta is the professionalism of their people. They must go thru a screening process before being hired because I don't recall an agent, flight attendant, or pilot that lost their cool in a stressful situation.On this particular trip as we were waiting to bag check there was a large family with four kids and they were out of control.  One kid was constantly crying and two of the others were bickering back and forth and the mother was starting to loose her cool.  The Delta agent calmly took it in and reassured the mother that she could take her time even thought there were a line of people behind the family. That moment of calmness eased my anxiety that I was feeling for the mother of the four."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,King of the skies,The flight from Nassau to NYC left on time and arrived a few minutes early. the flight lasted no longer than two and half hours. The flight from NYC to Tel Aviv also departed on time and arrived on time.The service for the entire flight was great and food service was good. Our bags were on the carousel after we left border control and getting out of customs in Tel Aviv was a breeze.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Non-stop to St. Thomas,Wonderful flight to Caribbean Paradise in the USVI. Both flights were full but well staffed and flight attendants were friendly and efficient. Great getaway on Delta since it is non-stop.
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Delta on Time,"An economy flight is an economy flight... not much leg space and seats don't recline. We bought tickets a year out when a great price popped up so were happy with cost. Our Delta flight to and from NY JFK and Athens pretty much left on time and arrived early. Our luggage showed up in Athens, NY and Columbus so no complaints there. Food coming back from Athens was much better than that going over. We'd probably use Delta again if flying to Greece."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Very friendly crew and great service,Flew economy class but was treated as business class. Flight attendants very attentive and cordial. Got to sit in bulkhead row due to empty seats. Lots of room. Food was good and tasty. Arrived early to destination on both flights. Great job!
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Delta is always reliable,We like to fly Delta. It seems more reliable. In fact are flights actually left their destination a little early each.  Flying is not what it used to be and we always have to fly economy but as long as you realize your snack will be soft drinks and crackers and you do not expect a lot of leg room you will be fine.  I always find the flight attendants to be patient and helpful.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,flight  service and food,"compared to other airlines, its service was quickly responsive and kind.its actual airline was Air France.especially its food was good to me."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Great service,Always good service and very friendly. Used our skymiles for the trip and had no problems. Check in was very organized as well as boarding.

Date of travel: November 2019,50,Another Great Delta Experience in Comfort Plus,"As Delta members, we located a flight to Cancun in November. We had another great experience in Comfort Plus.  The check in process was seamless, and the counter worker was friendly. The Delta terminal was acceptable, but of course the food is expensive in the airport for what you get. The boarding process was also seamless.  As Delta mileage members and purchasing Comfort Plus seats, we boarded ahead of the main group. Regarding the flight, we experienced no issues. The entertainment options were excellent, and alcohol was included. Regarding the staff, they were professional and friendly. We will continue to use Delta in the future."
Date of travel: June 2019,50,the flight was smooth and the cabin crew was attentive and poite.,The cabin crew went out of their way to make sure that it was a comfortable flight.  The food was pretty good and the in flight entertainment was good.  On my return the audio did not work so I alerted the cabin crew and they had two mechanics come on board and check it out and remedy the situation.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,No issues check-in to departure.,Arrived at airport to long lines.   Check-in/TSA screen quick and efficient.   Boarding process flowed smoothly and quickly.   Flight was smooth and without incident.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Excellent service as always,"Say what you want about flying, is it stressful? Most times, is it crowded on flights? For sure! What I love is the consistency of the service on the flights by Delta. They communicate, they’re mostly on time, and they are truly looking to make it as comfortable a ride as possible. I’ve had nothing but great experiences, flew over 60,000 miles this year and proud to say every one of those miles was on Delta!"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,very good,"professional, value add on with a great sense of transport needs for passengers and connection fligths"
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Could be better,"Despite all the new things Delta is trying to offer to the customer, I did not notice anything new. I cannot understand why to give a menu to customers if the food is the same as usual in economy, that means, bad? Why allow customers to fill up the plane with that small luggage in this kind of flight?"
Date of travel: December 2019,30,"Great flight going, late coming home","Always great to fly first class--no small chair, service, first on and off, great staff.  Easier to relax and rest, possibly nap if you desire.  MORE ROOM!"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Airport service lacking.   Quick but bumpy ride.,"Arrived two hours early for flight Thanksgiving Eve.  No waiting for check-in/TSA.   Requested wheel chair through Delta app, none available at check-in.   Luckily, short walk to gate.   Entire trip was windy and ride was bumpy DTW to BWI, however, flight arrived early.   Long time in air circling BWI."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Long trip made enjoyable by good timing,For once the connections on this long trip were sensible and made the journey almost enjoyable. The connection at Salt Lake City was just over two hours comfortably spent in the Delta Lounge.  All flights were on time for departure and arrival.
Date of travel: June 2019,50,Great Flight,The boarding process was easy. The flight was smooth. The renovations at LaGuardia do leave a lot to be desired. After passengers have picked up bags they must take a bus to an off site location to get a taxi. This adds time to getting into the city. If you are flying beware. The construction around the airport can cause even more traffic problems so beware! The inside of the airport is transformed and much better food service and flow of people traffic.
Date of travel: October 2019,40,End of a Two-week Trip,"Trip was quite comfortable. Seats felt a bit roomier than other airlines. I'm 6'4"" and had enough leg room. Had usual economy snacks and drinks."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Holiday travel,Thanksgiving trip to visit family. Delta does things right. No issues with check-in or flight.  We use them whenever we can. We don’t pay to check a bag. We had the exit row so we had plenty of leg room.
Date of travel: May 2019,10,First class was a great disappointment,"Going to Jaimacaweflew first class and it was wonderful, coming back toAtlanta we once again flew first class and it was terrible the flight attendant namedDebbie was to busy doing I have no idea to get us more than one drink, my food was suppose to be served hot it was stone cold and she could care less. Always sitting and couldn't be bothered to check if we wanted anything . I finally got another attendant to get me another bottle of water. My tv didn't work and when I asked her to look into it she stated that she wasn't a repairman. She certainly needs to be removed from the plane especially first class."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,hostes made sur we were taken care of,on time and left on time   and it was easy to check in and they took care of our lugeage and it arived in good shape.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great air line,Very gòod service. Comfortable seat. Good flight. Good meals. I would fiy with them again. Very recomended
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Love Delta,"Had a lovely flight, about 2-1/2 hours.   Waited in the Delta lounge, then boarded within 5 minutes.  Quick and easy, no hassles.  Flight attendants were extremely friendly and attentive.  Breakfast omelet was acceptable."
Date of travel: April 2019,40,No better airline,When we fly we always fly delta! They are always on time never any problems the crew and staff are friendly and accommodating it’s makes for a great vacation! Fly delta
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Very Smooth Flight but no extra amenities,Flew to Orlando and back last week to go on a short cruise to the Bahamas  with grandchildren.  We were surprised that flying first class we were not offered anything not also offered to coach other than the comfort of larger seats.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,On time and efficient!,"On time and very friendly service, with a smile. Always pre-check and have your tickets in advance. Get there early and set your seat assignments!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Relaxing and on time,"When we arrived at Terminal 3 Delta gate F4 at Sky Harbor Airport we were informed that the flight we were to be on was delayed awaiting some Federal action, but the flight was only 10 minutes late taking off, yet,  the original arrival time in Cincinnati was achieved. The flight crew was friendly and efficient. Granted, we were in first class so the creature comforts were all in place but it was a pleasant flight. Upon arrival, as almost always in Cincinnati, our baggage arrived as we made our way to the claim area. The shuttle to long term parking awaited passengers and we were quickly off to Fast Park and Relax to retrieve our vehicle. The new Terminal 3 is very pleasant as is the new Delta Sky Club facility and personnel.Greater Cincinnati airport has recently undergone remodeling and is quite pleasant."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Two legs all on time,Delta has been my preferred airline for well over three million miles.  They don’t stand out nearly as much as in the past.  I don’t fly as often as in the past so that is probably the reason.This two leg trip was packed but everything went on time.  Getting me to my destination without hassle is my main priority.
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Routine flights,Ahead of schedule by the time we landed in Seattle but then there was no gate at which to dock so we spent all of the gained time (and then some) sitting on the tarmac waiting for our gate to open up.  Still had plenty of time to reach next flight.  All employees with which I had contact were curteuos
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Always the friendliest service,I fly Delta as much as I can. The flight attendants are really friendly and helpful. The economy seat was just ok but there was enough room for me.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Good economy flight,"Flew with them round trip.  Legroom was fine, service very good.  No food just minimal snack choices.  Lots of movies to choose from and free WiFi. Overall, comfortable flight."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Friendly service  smiles all the way tasty snacks,Fog delayed but only few minutes late at destination.  Always smiling cabin crew and helpful in any problems. Had an assortment of snacks and I had to try them all.  Couldn’t be happier with the service provided.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Business Travel to E.K.,"I travel with Delta for two reasons:1) They are almost always on time2) Service is top shelfDelta flight crews not only are courteous and helpful to me, also to all who board their aircraft."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Nice Trip and Thanksgiving Day Savings,"Saved $800 per ticket departing on Thanksgiving Day, thanks Delta!  Even though they were working the holiday flight crew was very cordial and attentive.  Due to length of flight provided everyone with free headsets.  Didn't have the full contingent of Snack packs, but that was a minor inconvenience.  Departure on time and a tad bit early arrival."
Date of travel: March 2019,50,FLIGHTS ON TIME AND VERY PLEASANT,My husband is handicapped and there were no problems with getting to our flights on time. On the way home we had a 2 hour lay over and that was good because it took us almost that long to get thru customs. That was the only real pain about our trip
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Layover time,"Our layover time was approximately 45 minutes for our connection in Atlanta.  You really have to scramble to get from one gate to another.  We flew in at Terminal B and had to go to Terminal T.  That's a lot of walking, two escalators and the tram to get to there.  If you have to take that flight then get First Class seating so you are up front and don't have to wait for everyone to get their luggage, etc.  That takes more time to get off the plane."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,nice flight,"Overall pretty smooth flight.  We arrived ahead of schedule, which is nice.  We got an extra snack, which is also nice.  One thing I wonder about is why no airlines load their planes from the back to the front.  It would seem to a faster and more efficient process..."
Date of travel: July 2019,10,ABD...Anyone But Delta,"I have been air travelling since 1973. This was the WORST AIR TRAVEL EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE!The plane was old..with old dirty ashtrays in the seats and bathrooms. After we were CLOSED IN AND LOCKED UP at the departure gate, the pilot informed us that there would be no entertainment systems available for our 6 hour flight. Add cold and faulty air vents, dirty, dirty seats, and numerous insect bites (at least 15) over my flank, legs and feet; this made things even more horrific. My seat was certainly not occupied by a human on it's previous trip.One redeeming thing; the flight crew did their best to make it better. I'll never fly Delta again!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,DL49 Amsterdam to JFK final flight from Budapest,"A very friendly Delta crew manned this flight from AMS to JFK. The crew was customer focus, helpful, friendly and welcoming from beginning to arrival. A great job by all!!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Thanksgiving Day is the time to fly!,"After flying to New York to see the Macy's parade, we chose an 6:00 p.m. flight on Thanksgiving Day to return home, with a change of planes in Atlanta.  LaGuardia was not very crowded and our plane departed a few minutes early.  Because a lot of people do not travel on Thanksgiving Day itself, our plane proceeded to the runway and took off without having to wait in line.  We arrived in Atlanta to find the airport essentially deserted.  The only people, other than workers, on our entire concourse were the ones on our flight.  It was almost eerie.  However, it made getting to our connecting flight very easy as there were no crowds.  The flight from Atlanta also took off and landed early.  Service on both legs of the trip was great and we had numerous entertainment options on the seatback screens on the plane.  If your travel arrangements permit it, fly on Thanksgiving -- it was great."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Our flight was on time.,The service was great! The staff was friendly!I especially liked the new screening method that did no ring when my hip replacement was screened. I use to get patted down every time.
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Vegans need to take food!,"I choose Delta whenever they are available. The flight, the seats and comfort have always been good. This was my first overseas flight. I attempted to share my vegan diet beforehand and wS not able to connect with anyone about it. When the hostess passed out dinners, I was offered beef, chicken or pasta. I requested pasta and was given chicken. The gentleman seated in my row buzzed and told the lady I needed pasta. She said okay, took the chicken and waited til she served the entire plane before she brought me pasta. For breakfast she handed me a bag and I inquired if it was vegan. She snatched it out of my hands and never brought me anything....not a banana, orange, grapes or nutrient bar. Delta is definitely my favorite airline, however, they need to provide and respect to everyone."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,"efficient service, no surprises","Delta is my preference for most flights within the USA. They run a tight ship -- in the air and on the ground, and this flight lived up to expectations.I am often grateful to be able to access Delta's lounges via my American Express card, and the one I experienced in Atlanta was really good."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Crew took great care of us at LGA!,"I was flying with a group of 8.  There was a very long delay on the tarmac in ATL.  We knew we would never make our connection to ROC at LGA.  The departure was scheduled about 5 minutes from our arrival.We explained our plight of the flight crew.  While waiting to deplane, they announced that there would be carts waiting to get us to our gate, two terminals away.Sure enough, we hopped on and “flew” through LaGuardia where are Rochester bound plane was waiting for us.  I wish I was able to take video of them weaving through the airport, but I was facing backwards.I’m very grateful to the Delta people to accommodating us.  I would have been quite bummed if I didn’t make it home that night."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Best way from Midwest to Paris.,"For anyone living in or around Indianapolis, this is the best way to and from France. Delta has a seasonal non-stop to and from Paris Charles DeGaulle airport. It cuts time and makes it much easier to acclimate to the time changes. The service was good, (much like any airlines international service) and the crew was very informative, attentive & friendly. Even in coach, it was reasonably comfortable."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great flight!,"My wife and I decided to fly to New York to see the parade and got a direct flight from Columbia to New York leaving at 6:00 a.m. on Tuesday morning.  I am 73 and am not rich, or even ""well off"", but I have decided that when we can, we are going to fly first class.  We both appreciate the extra room and had a great flight.  We fly Delta whenever possible and always find the flight crew and cabin attendants to be polite, friendly and competent."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,sweet people of delta airlines,"Delta Airlines must seek out the sweetest spirited people to work in their customer service. I recently experienced superior customer service on all legs of my journey. From the flight attendants, gate attendants, baggage attendants and even the TSA agents. I must say my journey to visit family was most enjoyable even with some minor delays. Everyone was so nice and kind."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Rome in 16 hours,"Apart from plane comfort on this overnight flight in which we were given blankets and plillows, the abundant and quality food that practically didn't allow you to sleep, plus the excellent TV entertainment and crew and staff professionalism, this flight allowed us to get to know Rome, Italy as the plane had a 16-hour layover and we took advantage of this and practically escaped from Fumicino Aairport, taking a taxi to downtown Rome where we tasted Itailan pizza, slept in a hotel and the next morning, explored Termini Station, tool the subway, went around St. Peter Square and finally ended up in the Colosseum and at Fontan Di Trevi and everything o tiem to get back to the Atlanta plane. This was like a buy one get one free deal! I advise anyone to do the same. Amazing!"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Trip India,"The outbound trip was good and as expected from Delta, but the Return from London, was originally on Virgin but was changed to Delta, and they did not have our requested meals!!"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Going State side,"Flew from Dublin to Atlanta then on to Memphis and on to Nashville over a 10 day period, all with Delta Air Lines.Without exception we got excellent treatment.The staff could not have been more helpful and friendly, maybe it's because they are all mature and have been doing it for years or maybe it's because they take pride in their job,I don't know.Food was good, tasty and filling and lots of it,even during the night they had a buffet at the rear of the plane were you help yourself if you felt hungry.The only negative comment I would make is the plane itself,although clean and comfortable they do seem a bit old compared to some other airlines.Having said that I would have no problem traveling with Delta again."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Trip to Barcelona and back from Amsterdam were fabulous.,"They fed me so much I thought I would gain weight.  Al you can ask for, TV behind the seat, pillow, blanket, hot towel, snacks and snacks and more snacks, excellent meals, friendly staff.  Loved it.  Thank you Delta!"
n/a,40,Nice staff and decent food,"Having never flown with Delta before I was presently surprised. The staff were welcoming and attentive. The food service was generous and tasty. My only negative was my entertainment system which had issues that meant it needed to be reset regularly, but that's a maintenance issue. I did not experience this issue on the return leg. Yes I would fly with Delta again 👍👍"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,On time each leg of trip,"I flew Delta on a trip to Rome. I flew from Columbus through Detroit MI, to Rome Fiumincino in September, 2019. All my flights were on time, and I really didn't have any complaints at all. Meals were satisfactory, and service overall good.  I will definitely fly Delta again."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,One of the most comfortable flight I ever had,"I have flown many times before, but never on a commuter plane such as this one. Two seats on either side of the aisle. Very comfortable, very enjoyable"
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Improving toward being acceptable,"Delta continues its attempt to cheaply mimick its Asia based competition. incremental Service improvements, like cleaning the bathrooms regularly, are appreciated though they continue to avoid adding value to their experience. They still don’t understand that adding value adds revenue."
Date of travel: May 2019,40,Never Disappointed with Delta,We've always been well treated on our flights to the West Coast from New England on Delta.  Flight attendants are always attentive in First Class as they were in Economy.
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Never Fly Over Night,"Never fly over night because, you leave in the middle of the night, the seats are not lay down,  there is most likely a change of plane, there is no sleep.Never Fly Over Night"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Flights for the finest!,Husband and I took flight literally planning 4 days in advance and was greeted and taken care of well the entire flight t and from. Greatest airline and clean too. Love their new purple uniforms.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Big Easy getaway,Easy flight and great service down to New Orleans.  The new airport in New Orleans is so much better but it is a walk.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,They've gotten better,"Perhaps its all hit or miss.  Lunch was remarkably good.  Seat comfort and leg room were good.  One flight attendant was excellent, the other was lots of talk but little service.  Business class is expensive but worth it if you got the bucks and bad knees"
Date of travel: May 2019,40,Flying High,This flight was comfortable and I enjoyed being able to watch the flight pattern on the monitor to see what state and cities we were flying over.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,"Even though was along flight the service, food and entertainment make the deal.","Excelent treatment, good food and service. Pillows, blankets and headphone were on each seat. Boarding was ok. The facilities in the 767 were outdated. It should be refurbish."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Delta One Atlanta to Barcelona,"First time flying Delta One overseas. I loved it, my husband is a big guy so he didn’t fit as well. The meal and service were wonderful. Bedding was nice. Loved that I could lay down and doze. Never easy to sleep the whole time but it was a great way to go."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,nice flight,"We baorded right on time, left gate on time,crew was wonderful (based out of Bpston). they were very freindly and accommodating. arrived early."
Date of travel: July 2019,50,I love ❤️ Delta Airlines!!!,"I fly Delta 90% of the time.. only times I don’t is to Durango CO( no flights on Delta there) and to Las Vegas NV? No direct flights from PDX).But all my other travel in the USA and Internationally is always on Delta!From the moment I check in at the friendly Delta Desk until I board the plane, I feel that the Delta staff are always friendly & professional to each other and to passengers. The seats are very comfortable.  The flight attendants are always very friendly and helpful.  The pilots are top notch and very personal.. often coming out to chat with passengers.  The food is GREAT! And the movies are fabulous as well!Thank you Delta Airlines -  I always fly the friendly skies with you 💕"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Despite weather delay's Delta cares for customer experience,"I travel frequently for work, and tend to fly Delta even when there is no direct flight option. I do this because of the customer experience I have with Delta. This was recently highlighted on a flight from Detroit, in which the destination city (Las Vegas) had a ground stop due to weather.we were facing a 2.5 hour delay. During this weather delay, and even though it was not the airline at fault for the delay, Delta offered all customers in the gate area access to a snack basket with chips, cookies, almonds, and bottled water while they waited. Staff are consistently friendly and thoughtful."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,During Thanksgiving week flights arrived early or on time.  I was impressed.,It was excellent.  No problems during a very busy week for travelling. The flight attendants were very pleasant and helpful.  Thing just went very smoothly.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"Professional, on time, considerate, generous with drinks and snacks, comfortable","Professional, on time, considerate, generous with drinks and snacks, comfortable.  Flight attendants so kind and helpful.  Great movies"
Date of travel: October 2019,40,"Flight was terrific, airport not so!","Flight was great and on time. Checkin, gate and TSA attendents were very helpful and quick. Atlanta airport is difficult to negotiate and too big. Tough figuring things out, baggage, gates, transportation. Love our airport in Tampa, easy to get to, easy to park, cell phone lot is terrific. Easy to get there and find things. New restaurants are terrific, great for travelers."
Date of travel: July 2019,50,Delta,I absolutely LOVE DELTA. My flight was delayed coming home and they actually put me on a faster flight and even upgraded me to first class. They were so helpful and thoughtful.
Date of travel: March 2019,40,"GREAT Staff, small seats!","If you are a plus size like me, upgrade your seat or suffer!Delta's staff are fantastic! They bring water often. The meals are pretty good. Delivery of the meals, snacks, drinks, and water really help break up the time well. There were great movies, music, etc - free.There was a good amount of leg room."
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Flight to Florida,The flight was ok. We had to fly to Detroit then to Ft Lauderdale. On the way home we flew from Ft Lauderdale to Atlanta and then to Appleton which was a little better as we flew in a bigger airplane to Atlanta but then flew in a smaller airplane to Appleton. It seems as though the bigger the airport the bigger the airplane and comfort goes along with it.
Date of travel: November 2019,10,Delta is terrible,One of the worst flights I’ve ever taken in my life. There were three seats in the row behind us with two adults and a five-year-old child. Each adult had another child sitting on their lap. So they were five people and three seats behind me. I can’t believe this is even legal to do? To add to the terrible ride my seat was tiny cramped and very uncomfortable. But wait things get worse. The airConditioner wasn’t working and we were sweating most of the flight. The final straw was on the flight home my suitcase was robbed my toiletry bag was open and dumped out all through my suitcase they stole a bracelet and some other items for my luggage. I will never be flying Delta again. I recommend you pick any other airline.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Good Service,The flight left on time and arrived 10 minutes early.  The thing I liked the best is that I forgot my Kindle in the seat pocket and did not remember it until I got home.  The Delta people found it and called to let me know the next day...kidos to them.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,First class really is,I had been told the Japanese carriers were really good but their coach prices equaled Deltas first class. And Deltas Delta One cabin and service did not disappoint.  Lay down seats and top notch service for the price of JAL coach.  No contest.  This is not an option for the budget limited.  It is a great option for those who can't sit in a coach seat for 10-13 hours.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Great flight,"Used this route for the first time very impressed, will use this route in future. The cabin crew were great and very helpful."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,USN RETIRED,"Took personal offense to discriminate against Retired Military Service members not included as pre-board priority. Most active duty members in the military complete there 4 years and then leave the military. Yet those of us that persevered and provided military service for our country for a total 20 or more years are told that your policy only allows active duty this privilege. THIS IS A DISCRIMINATION, you should be ashamed to only recognize Active not ALL members whom hold a valid military identification of this pre-board policy. Will not select Delta for future flights unless no other alternative. Shame on you!"
Date of travel: July 2019,30,Don't Fly Delta inside U.S.,"The internaional portion of this trip was fabulous best service at the aiport and traveling a 5 star rating. The domestic portion was a zero hence my 3 rating. I have never has such bad service on any airline I have flown. I have flown over 500K miles as I use to live in Japan for several years. They treated me badly broke my walker and could have cared less, was surpoed to have someone meet at the to help never happened. Overseas they could not do enough for me. Even walked me through the diplomatic gates at customs to prevent long lines. Great, Great services overseas, U.S it just is the pis."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Gotten much better over the last ten years,"This was one of Delta's newer additions to it's fleet. The seats were much roomier. The flight left on time and arrived about 15 minutes early, which was good because I had a friend picking me up and had never flown into that airport.  Great flight!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"Great flight, great FA's","Great airline, great FA's, on time, no problems. I have been flying Delta consistently for the last four years. I travel every month to my other home in FL. Prior I have flown AA, United, & Jet Blue, you can't beat Delta, least number of canceled flights, best on time, and people that actually like their jobs."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Business,"Loooooong flight a little over 13 hours, Flight was good left on time plane was comfortable and clean. but like all flights the seats could be a little wider."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Don't overlook Delta for FLL - BOS,"Delta has only one non-stop flight each way between FLL and BOS.  Don't overlook it when comparing tickets, times and prices.   I take this flight regularly and have experience no delays or cancellations."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Delta always does us top of the line,"We had an easy flight into Atlanta and layover a few hours then into Daytona FL. The airport in Daytona is very similar to Springfield MO, with easy access to rental cars and exiting the airport. Delta attendants worked hard to get us all served on the short flight up and down. They are always pleasant and intuitive to the needs of the passengers."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Smooth Sailing,Another on time flight with smooth sailing. A little bumpy landing but great movies made the trip seem short. The movie ended just when we got to the gate. The staff was courteous and friendly. The Delta Lounge was relaxing and is now serving hotdogs and ice cream products. That's new.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Good job,Flights were on time. Connections were great. In Atlanta had to move 3 gates away.Attendants courteous. Drinks were timely.  Snacks were ok
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Thanksgiving visit,"The flights departed on time, but the flight into Minneapolis was quite late.  My bags arrived with my flight.  Flight attendants were fantastic. On my flight from ATL to MSP there was no video monitor for my seat."
Date of travel: April 2019,20,return flight was delayed almost five hours,Flight to Cancun was great --- on time and comfortable.Return flight was delayed in Atlanta for about five hours and Delta offered nothing to make the wait more tolerable.  My children were miserable and we finally arrived in Newark around 4:00 AM.
n/a,10,What a Very Unfortunate Flight,"Going to Tokyo, I relished the upgrade.  On this one, that changed dramatically.  Steward said the ""downgrade started Nov 1.""  My entertainment did not work; steward came after an hour--no use.  Food was not at all the level I had eaten 10/31.  I rejected it.  Bad food and ""service"" to match.  One star is for a smooth flight."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,I Always Fly Delta,"I always fly Delta!  And I always have a pleasant flight.  Flying the Wednesday before Thanksgiving could be challenging, but everything went perfectly.  I highly recommend Delta."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Great Direct Flight,It was a direct flight.  We were very satisfied with flight and service. It was a welcome change to fly direct rather than have layovers and changing planes.  We will definitelyconsider this option in the future.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"Nice job, Delta!",We both felt that Delta service has improved and were grateful for the noted improvement. We needed a wheelchair for me and the wheelchair was timely and efficient. Made our trip much more comfortable. The Delta staff were kind and considerate.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Improved service,"Service is as usual excellent,, but sitting in the last row was not! My wife is sensitive to motion sickness, and there was motion in the last row, but couldn’t pick seats because we flew economy!"
Date of travel: August 2019,10,Unreasonable Layovers,"After purchasing our tickets on Delta 6 months in advance with a 3 hour layover in Atlanta, we were told they had changed the flight a little over a month before the flight  date and we would have an overnight layover for which we had to cover our own hotel room. Fortunately our travel company was able to cancel the ticket and reroute us on a more cooperative airline."
Date of travel: October 2019,30,"No, no on a Boeing 757",I am only 5'6 and my wife is 5'3 and we were extremely cramped on the 757.  I will adjust our travel in the future so that we do no fly on this configured aircraft again.
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Dependable friendly efficient service,"This is the 4th time in recent years that we have flown Detroit to Europe.  Our destination was Krakow with a brief layover in Amsterdam. In the past we've flown Delta direct to Paris, London, and Rome. On almost every flight we've had little or no problems, and when we did, it was easily resolved. Flight attendants are friendly and available to make you comfortable throughout the flight from beverage service and two meals, to hot towels, earbuds, and eye masks.  Seats are comfortable. Movie selection broad enough to satisfy most people. Detroit is a Delta hub so we also fly them domestically.  Highly recommended!"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,On time every time.,Both flights were on time. Attendants were pleasant and helpful. The seating was cramped and uncomfortable.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,delta airline great,flight was great just would not recommend Delta tours for vacation as they do not assist their customers well
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great Flight,Everything went as planned. The crew was friendly and accommodating. The flight time was less than 45 minutes.
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Delta Flight Attendants Need Attidtude Adjustment,"I took the red eye from SeaTac to MSP on the Monday following Thanksgiving and after the Seahawks v. Vikings game.. The First Class Flight Attendants ( a middle aged woman with glasses and brown hair and a younger guy) were very rude. She was extremely rude and the guy wasn't at all friendly. Granted, it was a red eye and very early morning when we took off but the service still wasn't up to par. My advice to the female flight attendant-- stop flying if you can't be a least somewhat friendly."
Date of travel: November 2019,20,Seattle to Mexico city and then Mexico city to PV,Horrible nonrellining seats- poor food - we got there in one piece- flew Alaska home- Never again for delta
Date of travel: December 2019,50,"Smooth, on time flight","I almost always fly Delta, so I am familiar with the whole process and find it very easy. Be patient and listen carefully when they call the various groups for boarding."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,As to this flight - great; Avoid CDG at all costs...,"First - I do like Delta and try to fly them as often as needed - however, I learned a lot from this trip. We were late getting out of DTW due to weather and deicing. While no big issue on an eight hour flight, I learned things were to change. The flight was truly uneventful - good seats, meals, and entertaining. Arrival at CDG was basically on time but then the fun begins. The French National Strike was on and controllers were participating, delaying departing flights. Seven hours in the terminal. Secondly, I have never, ever been in an terminal which is so poorly laid out and hard to negotiate. It comes down to this - fly Delta if you can, but avoid CDG (unless your final destination) at all costs."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Weather Delay Hustle,"The flight was delayed at take off by weather, but the staff in ATL was extremely helpful. Re-booked and still on track."
Date of travel: November 2019,20,Attendants are a little flighty,"I sat in my seat and the seat belt had work done to it and was to short.  I mentioned it to the attendant, she said she would get an extension.  The flight was starting to leave and  two attendants went down the isle ""looking for trays and belts"" somehow both walked right past me with my seat belt on my knee."
Date of travel: June 2019,50,"Delta One Athens, Greece to New York JFK","My Class of service was Delta One, much better than First class.This was my first time traveling in Delta One class and it was absolutely Wonderful. From the moment we boarded my wife and I felt special. The service, the meals, and the amenities were top self.The lay flat bed, with Bose noise canceling head phone and large screen monitor, cannot be beat."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Excellent food n cabin service.,"Delta is definitely stepping up there game with lots of free food,water,snacks,hot towels, earbuds, pillows, n blankets. Enjoyed our flight very much! Would fly Delta again."
Date of travel: August 2019,20,Uncomfortable seating,Flight from Kentucky to Ga. seats were to small and uncomfortable. Flight from Ga to PR was much better
Date of travel: December 2019,50,No worry traveling,Excellent trip with Delta. Timely departure/arrival and gracious staff. Hassle-free travel. Always love having a TV to watch movies and pass the time on flights.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Is first class really worth it?,"Well first class from Syracuse to the connection in Atlanta was worthless. On the Atlanta to St. Thomas leg a meal was served but my gluten free option was still partially frozen. The extra leg room is great until the customer in front of you fully reclines their seat. I at 5'5"", 130 lbs had a great deal of trouble getting from my window seat to the aisle to use the restroom. My husband, seated next to me even got up from his seat to try to make it easier for me. I practically had to step on our seats to make it. That is ridiculous! What a waste of money!"
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Delta airline experience,"Premium economy is always so much better than regular coach & preferable if the price is not too much more on international flights. Delta always has friendly, considerate flight attendants which helps on longer flights."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great!,"Flew for our honeymoon.  In flight movie selection, free ear buds, went around for food twice. Very nice."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Smooth Thanksgiving Flight,I anticipated a delay in my flights but they both proceeded smoothly and efficiently. Kudos to Delta! Great service too!
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Exceptional Crew,"From the moment I stepped on this plane and was welcomed by friendly faces and whole-hearted “good mornings” I knew it was going to be a great flight.  The pilot was not messing around, ...he put our plane in the air so quickly and smoothly that I had to look out the window to see if we were still on the ground!  The crew, including Lenny and Kia, were fantastic!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Awesome,"Great seats ,enough room, TVs on the flight with movies tv shows, snacks and drinks and they even asked me if I wanted an extra snack...... it was just a great experiance.... I'll never fly spirit again, delta was way better and the same price after you pay for all your bags on spirit and try n fight wieght.... I'll use and recommend delta from now on.... just great"
Date of travel: July 2019,40,"Great service  on  Comfort + legs of my flights, can't say the same for the economy portions.","Comfort+ was excellent, can't say the same about the economy portions but to be fair economy on Delta was no worst than economy on any other airline and the economy portions were the short portions of our flights."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Easiest Flight,This was the easiest flight I have ever taken. I was in the middle of the middle row and was surprisingly still very comfortable. The was a wide range of in flight entertainment and we were never bored. The dinner and breakfast meals were delicious. The pillow and blanket provided were very clean and comfortable.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,New Airbus redesign  very good,Delta looks like they got it  for customer.  The new design for the cabin on this A320 was very comfortable and classy.  Enough room  for me.Flight from MHT to Atl to MYR was cramped.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Excellent flights,Everything worked as we expected.  Flights departed and arrived on time and the personnel at Delta were courteous and friendly. Flight was round trip from Atlanta to LaGuardia and return 7 days later.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Impressed again,"Use to fly delta back in the day and it was terrible but in the last year I've recently given it another try and I've been so impressed, it's my go-to airline. It's definitely not the cheapest but you get what you pay for and they are always so friendly and kind."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,First trip to DC,"My sister and I flew on a Delta regional carrier from La Crosse to MPLS and then Delta to DC Reagan Flights were on time and comfortable.  Return flights was routed through Detroit and were also on time and comfortable. My only complaint was the curbside checkin. While my sister was checked without a problem, I was directed inside with no explanation. Curbside staff were short and rude, even though they were not busy."
Date of travel: October 2019,20,"In, out, you're on your own buddy","As Virgin Atlantic's internal USA partner carrier, you would expect this airline to attempt to emulate Virgin's high standards.  Absolutely no way !  Bums on seats, empty seats available at departure for knock down prices, a mad scramble to board, minimal in flight services, makes Ryanair look positively luxurious."
Date of travel: October 2019,20,Not a huge fan...,Not a fan for a couple of reasons. We booked the least expensive flights. They assigned our seats at the gate and with 4 family members (including 2 kids) none of us were seated near each other. Flight was booked well in advance.Had to check our carry on bags at the door on the plane. Instructions for pick up where less than clear when we de-planed. When I realized 3/4 of us had bypassed the pickup line (which was on the jetway) we were not allowed to go back down the jetway to get in line. The Delta agent at the counter in JFK was rude and not at all helpful.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Returning from NYC THANKSGIVING vacation.,"This is my return flight from NYC to Northwest Florida International (Panama City Beach) via ATLANTA, on 12/2/2019. It was a midmorning flight that got me back home a few minutes short of 2:00 PM.I flew Delta Comfort which gave me a fairly comfortable seat and plenty of legroom, and I am no slouch when it comes to size.All takeoffs and landings where on time, and the gate for the connecting flight was just opposite the arrival gate. Layover time was practically a few minutes.If one doesn't expect from flying to be wined and dined, but fast, comfortable, and efficient transportation, then, this is it. One can only hope for this kind of service every time one travels by air."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Weather Related Flight Cancellation Handled Professionally,"Unfortunately a freak snowstorm, snuck up on us. Forcing Pearson Airport to delay or cancel fights.  Ours was one of them.  I had signed up for notifications which was a lesson that I always will.  While at home packing my phone pinged. I had a text message saying our flight was cancelled.  Please call.  I called only to learn that Delta had already put us onto a later flight.  It was in the Main Cabin, but at least we were still being fortunate to fly out.  De icing did take an hour, but we were in the air and off to our destination same day.  I have a disability, not visible.  I had mentioned it to the Delta Rep on the phone previously.  No big deal.  When we were at the gate, I was paged and quietly informed a note was on my file, would I like the preboard service. I declined as other could use it more than I.  The staff at the gate were so kind and helpful...they took my husbands and my backpack and boarded us first.  Alway so kind and helpful."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Usuall On Time,"They do a good job, but sometimes the bathrooms are broken. Maybe I get the same plane and there is an issue. Who knows, but huge lines on my last flight."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Thanksgiving family trip,Flew on Delta and stewards were friendly and nice on all flights. Free movies made the trip so nice . Two  things I wish was if they would load the plane from back to front and offer gluten free snacks . It is so hard to squees past everyone already loaded to get to your seat and it takes forever .
Date of travel: March 2019,40,Indianapolis - Paris,This is a very convenient and good flight. No hassle with transfers at major US hubs. This flight is not every day. It flies to Paris 1 day and returns the next. No flight on Monday.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Short and sweet,"The flight was smooth, short and sweet despite weather related issues in Boston.  There was a minimal delay of 15 minutes but everything else was great."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,"Delta Air Lines and other Air Lines  "" Flight attendants only get paid when the wheels are up!!!!""""""""","It is a unfortunate truth that the Air Lines do not pay the Flight attendants while you are loading & unloading, sitting on the tarmac!! I have flown of 5 different Air lines and ask the attendants if this applies to them.. It does:(.. These hard working folks have a huge responsibility to insure our safety and insure  spend many hours of training to insure us ""if"" there is a need they can handle the proper procedures.Did you know that the flight crew is to have access / shared  the oxygen bottles the pilots have. Again most of them will not share it!! I write this as I have verified and wanted to be the town crier..."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Great Crew,"There was poor visibility between MKE and MSP so we needed to wait a bit before we could board. When boarding was allowed we were rerouted so we needed to go through 3 concourses; my husband wouldn't even let me use the restroom! WE WERE NOT GOING TO MISS THE FLIGHT TO Mexico City! :) Anyway, the crew was waiting for us!! (I normally sit by the window and don't move or bother anyone. But, I still had 'to go'. So, the plane waited for me again! Thanks! I will NEVER forget their kindness to me!!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Trip to Athens Ga.,Great flight! The flights were on time and the staff on board were friendly and happy to help in any way they could.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Easy Connection In Atlanta,"We connected through Atlanta.  Normally, I have to search for the boards to discover which gate we have to reach.  This time, they had a gate attendant who openly offered to help find connecting flights.  That used to be the norm, along with reading the connecting gates over the intercom.  Nice to have someone do the first part again.For the details that are in Delta's reasonable control, they do a great job!"
Date of travel: September 2019,40,"Johannesburg, SA",This is a nice flight but long. Book early as the plane is usually full. Coming home on the return flight I the seat cushion I used on our game drive vehicles. After several hours the plane seat was a little uncomfortable.
Date of travel: November 2019,30,not the greatest,An old plane for a cross country trip. The TV did not work nor did anyone seem to care...4.5 hours!!!! If you fly first class it ought to be. Certainly wasn't this time.
Date of travel: October 2019,20,Cramped and Uncomfortable,"The seats seem to be getting smaller every time I fly. They were cramped and uncomfortable, even though we bought the Delta Comfort seats. The restroom was extremely dirty by the time we arrived. The staff however, was professional, efficient, and very pleasant."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,"Flight on time, all Delta Personnel courteous and helpful","Everything went well, on time, all Delta staff were great. 100 minimum characters is a ridiculous requirement."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"Delta's personal was excellent, pleasant, helpful check-in in GSO she was great. Gate agents were nice, friendly and he","Delta's employees were helpful, friendly, and accommodating. Couldn't have ask for better service. Flights were on time, and our connection in Atlanta was excellent. Overall one of the best flights we have had in a long time."
Date of travel: November 2019,10,Horrible just horrible,"Had a group of pilots that did not feel like flying.  Numerous unexplained delays, take off and return to airport, changed planes - after 9 hours of hell Delta finally cancelled the flight.Sent to hotel with no toiletries or food so got to scrounge a bit.Essentially ruined the vacation."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Disability flight care,Delta was excellent in my disability wheelchair care.  I could not have been more pleased.  Comfortable and excellent cabin service.  Planes were all on time.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Amazing flight from ATL to JNB!,"My family and I went to Johannesburg, South Africa in September 2019 and we had a wonderful time! The flight service on Delta flight 200 was great. The food was nice, the views were amazing, and we really enjoyed it. The flight attendants were very nice and helpful for any questions we had. We had our return flight from JNB to ATL on Delta flight 201 about 11 days later and it was also great. It even arrived about 45 minutes ahead of schedule! That was awesome, especially since we flew for about 15 hours nonstop halfway around the world! Look forward to flying with Delta again in the future and I definitely would highly recommend the flight from ATL to JNB for anyone thinking about South Africa or the return flight for anyone thinking about the US."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Seamless air travel,"Very good overall experience with Delta. Booking experience, check in, boarding and flight experience all very good. Customer service seems to be a very big priority to Delta, other airlines talk the talk but do not consistently deliver."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Reliable And Excellent,"Took the red-eye flight this time.  The crew were courteous and considerate when balancing the needs of those that were sleeping, and those who were awake.  Being awake, I was able to watch them a bit.They were careful as they navigated the isle way and used hushed voices when speaking.  I was very appreciative.I've been on other red-eye's when the crew seemed oblivious to people trying to sleep.  This was a nice change.I've never had a real problem with Delta, not one that I felt was in their control, and beyond the reality of life happening.Definitely my airline of choice."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Family weekend,The employees for Delta were very courteous and helpful in all stages of our flight...from taking care of our luggage to making sure we were comfortable
Date of travel: January 2019,40,Great employees but,"Delta employees have always been very good. The only problem I have with Delta is the lack of communication if they change itinerary on you. We have had plane changes and they will stick in the back with other seats, time changes or seat changes and no email to notify us. Any change should mean an email with explanation."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,OMG!  Food was good!!,Longer flights are always tough and this was our second of 3 flights.  We were in the main cabin and loved our choice of food.  Cocktail followed by appetizer choice (we chose melon with prosciutto) and 3 choices of main (we chose gnocchi with basil creme sauce topped with pine nuts and tomato).  Dessert was salted caramel sherbert.  Delicious!  Later snack was goat cheese & vege pizza.  Also yummy!
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"Delta airlines, YES.","As always, excellent airline. Thanks for is for being my first choice in airlines.  Good cookies, coffee and juices too."
Date of travel: June 2019,30,Overated,Well economy. It was just that. Packed like a sardine. The flight was totally full. Looking at the plane there did not seem to be much difference between First Class and Economy other than the size of the seat. Snacks passed out were minimal and on our return flight they ran out halfway through service. Definately recommend either bringing something with you or trying to eat at the airport if you are not running to another concourse. There was very little seating at the airports for ambulatory handicaped individuals.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Wonderful flight crew,"This is a very long flight and comes at the end of a busy day of travel but the flight crew make it a very comfortable experience and provide excellent service. They have very good food, offer choices of snacks and fresh coffee, and work to insure your needs are met without unnecessary interruptions. Also, I landed at 5:48 am and was able to get through customs, get an earlier flight and walk on the plane at 7:00 am. This kind of service is truly unheard of."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Excellent short hop but large price fluctuaion,"The smaller airplane used on this route was one of my favourite. The shortness of the flight really did not required much service, but what service I received was adequate. I never got tire of look the mountain and desert scenery en route. It was beautiful especially when you take the first flight out at 7am. The sun and mountain was ever changing on this 1 hour flight,. The only complain is the price of this first class ticket fluctuates widely depending on the day and even time of the day"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,"Same day flights, luncheon in Minneapolis.","Both flights were on time, smooth and uneventful. Passenger service was good. Check in was swift and uneventful. The economy seat was typically small with very short pitch. The cabin was reasonably clean. In flight service was normal and efficient."
Date of travel: June 2019,50,Fabulous Return from Dublin Ire to Boston MA Logan,This was the most fascinating fight that originated at 9:40 AM Dublin time and was enroute to Boston MA.  This flight ran ahead of schedule once in the sky to Logan MA Airport and had the best inflight service possible.  The passengers sitting next to me on 06/20/2019 were very polite and the crew Flight attendants and Cockpit extremely nice and knowledgeable to our travel itineraray and always informed us of our flight progress via monitors in our passenger seats.  The judgement as to when we needed to be in our seats due to inflight turbulence was very accurate as mostly it was a very smooth run that day as opposed to this 12/09/2019 day in most of the US being many storms of rain and snow.  On 06/27/2019 it was scattered clouds and very good visibility.The meal service was great and very timely with correct food temperature and quality at service time.  The dessert service was very artistic selective by their Airport Chefs prior to loading oon the plane and the beverages very tasty including all hot and cold service.The inflight movie and game computer at my seat was in topo working order and experienced no downtime when playing the inflight games in which I received top winning scores vs computer players.Best of wishes to you on the upcoming Christmas and New Year which is up two weeks from now in which much of the country had favorable December with no telling what will occur Christmas and New Years week when you are the busiest.  Best of luck to you accomodating all at that time.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Family vacation to New Orleans in November,"I traveled with family to New Orleans in November. The flight was wonderful... unfortunately, it was our scheduled aircraft. My husband was pulled out of line and sent back to the TSA check-in area due to an overly aggressive and trainee K9 that was stationed at our boarding gate for the flight. There was absolutely no reason for being detained and TSA didn't have any explanation. Not the fault of Delta... but they did put us on the next available flight, which was wonderful!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Loyal to Delta,"I really prefer Delta Airlines over other carriers as the cabins are clean and more comfortable.  The crew both at the gate and onboard are very friendly and keep the passengers well informed.  I usually fly economy but used miles to fly first class on this flight.  I think I will save my miles and remain in the main cabin on future flights.  When I left Alexandria, LA, our flight departure was delayed.  Lesa and Tamika were nothing short of awesome taking care of passengers and keeping us updated on progress.  Great job!!!!!!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Excellent service from all departments,"We booked our flights originally in Main Cabin with Delta because they had the best connections needed to get to our destination of Hanoi, Our return was from Ho Chi MInh City (Saigon), We had booked about 7 months in advance so there were several schedule changes. Each time, the Delta reservation agents were able to help us find satisfactory connections. We flew internationally on Delta. On the inter-Asia flights, we flew on Delta's partner - Korean Air, All flights were on time. Baggage was always arrived with us. I should point out that the upgrade we decided to pay for was well worth it. Premium economy has a designated check-in area,, The seats are very comfortable with a wider seat and there is a much more leg room. Delta’s staff is well groomed and always professional. I will add that Korean Air was very good too. Delta has been my airline of choice for many years."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Good Flight,"Good flight without negative incidents. However, would avoid Dublin airport and use another airport in Ireland. Very negative experience when seeking information from staff at Dublin airport."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Delta Airline to NYC,"Outstanding non-stop flight on Delta. No hassle and excellent service! It was Avery smooth flight and on time,"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,DELTA GOING EXTRA MILE,"My wife recently took trip from Omaha, NE to Medford Oregon. They had layover in Salt Lake, and had problem with plane. Delta eventually decided to not take that plane until felt it was safe. They kept passengers and made every accommodation possible. My wife was put up in a very nice hotel. They had people helping every step of the way! The final leg of trip was better time than the original one. We will not hesitate to tell others about how good Delta was to her. Thanks Delta!"
Date of travel: November 2019,10,Worst crew ever.,"This was the worst experience I have ever had with a flight crew. The attendants were disrespectful, rude and not at all professional. I asked for something to take my medicine with, the attendant brought water, although coke was requested because the taste of vomit was in my mouth, as my medicine didn't work as she took almost an hour to get us the water, another half hour for the coke. The woman in front of me ordered a bloody mary and the attendant who gave her the little bottles of vodka that turned-out to be empty. The customer tried to get their attention and it took over 45 minutes. I had to have my video reset and that also took a ridiculous amount of time, another 45 minutes. I started to vomit and the attendant tried to take my cup, and I asked her not to because I was throwing up. She did not recommend the bags in the seat pockets. She took the largest plastic bag on board and threw it at me. The woman in 25C can vouch for this, she gave me a Ziploc bag that wouldn't asphyxiate me and I can vouch for her patience with the crew, that instead of being sorry for giving her an empty bottle of vodka, the attendant responded 'bummer' and didn't offer any way to make-up for the fact that she had waited so long. On our connecting flight from Austin to Salt Lake the attendant refused to give us a blanket and a pillow for our next DELTA flight, when there were several on the floor in plastic still right in front of us. Fortunately the next crew from Salt Lake to Seattle was respectful and considerate and allowed us to have a pillow and blanket for our eight year-old to be able to sleep. There were other issues but this has already taken too much of my time."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Staff were awesome....,Staff were very welcoming and attentive!  Love the way Delta recognizes our service personnel!!  I was about to use a bevnap as a tissue and the flight attendant grabbed several tissues and handed them to me.  Talk about observant AND customer service!!
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Easy flight,"The last several trips, Delta has been very timely with boarding. They have been quick easy flights."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Easy flight,"Small seats, but each leg of the flight had the entertainment screens on the back of the chairs so it made the time go by quickly.  Complimentary soft drinks and snacks were offered at least one time each leg. One one of the legs however the entertainment screens were working intermittently which was a bit frustrating."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Delta Airlines for the Win,"Great service, smooth flights (even in those crazy rainstorms we had back in October)Even at one point before our departure (I can’t remember which one it was) The Captain came around and shook everyone’s hand. I never experienced anything like that before.  All flights on time, or early!Amazing!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Boring - on time and friendly service!,"Great, on time, no problems. Not even bumpy. Attendants were attentive. Pilot was informative. Seats were as comfortable as can be in economy class."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Lost in the Bermuda Triangle,"Friendly staff, average legroom .  We actually lost radar and circled in the Bermuda Triangle for over an hour, but all was safe and now have a fun story!!"
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Problem solved as best as possible,"A wacky passenger decided to light up and smoke as we were taxing for take off. She ignored the attendants attempts to have her put out the cigarette.  We had to return to the gate to have the woman removed. All Delta personnel handled the situation with calm and determination. Although the flight was delayed, Delta did all in there power to make the passenger comfortable and be of assistance."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Improved customer satisfaction,"Over the years, I have seen an improvement with Delta with customer service and their employee attitudes. Food on the long flight was good. I believe Delta and other airlines put more effort into pleasing customers on international flights. If price is competitive, I would definitely fly with them."
Date of travel: June 2019,40,The reliability of Delta,Went on vacation after a recent hospitalization and delta had been very accommodating with my boarding and deplaning at each stop. Very helpful staff and people that genuinely seems to care about my trip. Was always a fan of southwest but this experience warrants a permanent switch!!
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Tokyo-NRT- Lay flat or not,"Wow- Once you use the lay flat seats from any airline- its tough to go to the back of the plane again- Flew from Argentina a few years ago and now can't see myself or wife using any other kind of seat for flight over 6 hours-That said just flew from Atlanta to Tokyo round trip on the Delta One- A350- its the best lay flat i thin around; flew the Boeing 777, 767, 747 to Singapore -all are a little behind the A350 that Delta One uses. The only thing about some of the other flights i did was the very attractive stewardess's, along with their very polite and pampering of male customers. :)"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,good flight,"stress free and uneventful, seat assignments were typical. All flights were on time with no delays. CAK was a sleepy little airport that I recommend."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Softest landings,On time flights with the smoothest landings in Detroit and Tampa that we ever experienced. Excellent pilots on both flights.
Date of travel: April 2019,50,The Airline Was Fine But the Terminal Flunked,"Delta Airlines is a direct link between NY and Denver which makes life easier than having to make a stop or change planes. But the security at the Denver airport is so tight that it really messed up our flight. I had accidentally packed 4 oz yogurts not realizing that the maximum was 3.5 oz. We were pulled out fo line. My husband's cell phone was stolen from the possessions bin. To add insult to injury, we were lectured about the yogurt and needlessly detained as we were shown the weight on the container by the security guard. I was very shaken up and even crying on the plane. The flight attendants were more interested in getting me off the plane than in comforting me for the mistreatment we had gotten in the airport."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Flew Delta from Miami to Montreal via Atlanta,Great service at the airport and on board- Flights on time - easy connection in Atlanta-  I use the Delta lounge in Miami  Amazing staff
Date of travel: May 2019,40,Good airline but limited route options,I had several flights to Edmonton this year via Delta Airline and United Airlines.Both airlines have a terrible route options especially returning back to Lexington. I give higher marks to Delta over United due to the service from flight crew. The ticket counter or Terminal agents are about the same but flight crews are much friendlier.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Helpful crew and great flight!,"I have flown Delta several times, but this is the first time flying in Comfort +.  The crew was helpful at helping me navigate overhead storage, and I was able to choose more than one in-flight snack."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Disgusting,"(Flight delayed 2.5 hrs.) I did send Delta a letter suggesting they take the lead and offer ""Hankies"" to coughing & sneezing passengers that don't cover their mouths, and announce for those with colds please cough or sneeze into something to protect those passengers sitting around you. The girl sitting to my right coughed for 8.5 hrs mostly without anything to cover her mouth. Then the girl sitting behind my wife had her bare foot wedged between the side panel and my wife's arm rest. People are disgusting! Where are their manners? What happened to etiquette? Just prior to exiting I turned and looked down the aisle and it looked like a junkyard. Pillows, water bottles, trash etc. Couldn't wait to get out of the plane to get home and shower."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Above and beyond,"I was pleasantly surprised by our recent trip with Delta and have not experienced this positive of an airline experience for some time. While challenged by weather the entire Delta team was amazing, from the call center staff who helped us reschedule and reroute when storms delayed connections to the Delta aiport staff who supported us with wheelchair transfers ensuring we were in the right places at the right time. And, without whom my spouse would not be able to accompany me! And kudos to the onboard team of pilots and stewards who were positive, helpful and kind! Thanks for inspiring us that air travel can be a positive part of your trop experience."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Ft Myers to the Great White North,Great flight.  Left actually a few minutes early as the flight was full and all passengers were on board and seated.  Service was impeccable by the flight attendants.
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Avoid A321,Having flown an A321 on another carrier I was hopeful this plane would be better. It wasn't. I will avoid them at all costs in the future.Almost missed our connection due to 1st segment 50 minute delay; no explanation from Delta.
Date of travel: November 2019,20,not enough time in sunny Florida,"I always like to fly delta but this flight was a real was disappointment. It was the 5:20 AM flight. There are always delays but that morning's delays were handled poorly. We had pulled away from the gate and were told we would be taking ""soon"". 45-50 minutes later we were taking off with no announcement or explanation. I am sure there were individuals worried about making connections. The lack of communication or better yet no communication was very poor and unprofessional..     My flight from DTW to PBI was great."
n/a,50,I only fly Delta,"I have travelled for business for the past 25 years.  I have flown both domestic and international and average around 125,000 miles per year.  While every airline has problems at times, i appreciate the extra benefits i get from delta.  The ease of upgrading, access to the delta lounges and the overall condition of their fleet.  Most of their international partners are pretty good as well."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Improvement in Business Class Breakfast Very Necessary,"I did not like the 2 choices of breakfast, so I ordered the Asian breakfast. When it was put in front of me, I couldn’t believe that they called that an Asian breakfast at all: potatoes with greasy sautéed peppers on top. Needless to say, I did not eat it. In no way shape or form was that an Asian breakfast. I was not happy."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Trans Continental,"Check in and customer service are great. Planes could do with a little TLC on the interior, however, it feels safe and well organised. Comfortable long haul flight"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Delta all the way!,"I love flying out of a smaller regional airport.  GNV does not disappoint!  The people are very nice, and the airport has all of 3 gates.  Delta has 7 non-stop flights into ATL daily.2 of the flights are on Delta A-320 airplanes which gives you more room all the way around.  The other flights are on smaller regional jets.  Delta comfort seats are in the front row of plane, but do not offer much if any, overhead space for your bags.  Take note of this for future plans!  Otherwise, very convenient to connect to the rest of the world!  :)"
Date of travel: June 2019,40,"Flight to Rome, Italy","Flight to Rome was great; so glad we chose the premium seats as the extra legroom was an absolute necessity.  They seemed to feed us constantly.  :)The return trip from Venice to was not quite as wonderful.  The bathrooms ran out of paper products and the paper waste receptacles were running over.  The cabin was absolutely freezing with everyone bundling up with the blankets that were provided plus any extra layers we had.  Otherwise, it was a good flight both ways."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Excellent service regardless of seat,"16+ hour flights can test your resolve, especially if you are sitting  in the cheap seats! Free movies, ample eats, left out for the entire flight, in addition to the hot food at mealtimes, and a very friendly staff that went out of their ways to make the flight tolerable made this excursion much less of an ordeal than it sounds. Lots of bathrooms also relieved this added pressure from the trip."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,IAD TSA is very slow.,"Delta's part was all good; a nice quick flight and great crew, but IAD's TSA Precheck was the pits. About a 25 min wait. I am told that was better than for previous passengers that day. in contrast, DCA's TSA takes about 5 minutes.Get to IAD early."
Date of travel: April 2019,50,Delta always Stellar,I got upgraded and really appreciated it. Food was excellent as were choices of entertainment system. Crew very nice and plane was clean and on-time. Who could ask for more?
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Delta still best?,"Delta has been my ""Go - To"" airline for the past 20 years. I've amassed over a million miles with them, and am closing in on 2 million. Unfortunately, cost/competition has hit them such that I feel less and less special. I was bumped from an aisle seat to a middle Comfort Plusjust behind first. The entertainment screen has to be down before taking off and down way before landing - and the middle seat provides excellent viewing of the two seats ahead, their big screens and constant attention by the assigned attendant. Comfort Pus no long has special Snacks, attention, entertainment, or leg room - disappointing really. However, it was a free ""upgrade"" and I shouldn't complain. My wife says I act too entitled, and perhaps she is right! But I do miss the special treatment of the past..."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Good airline despite shrinking legroom and lack of food,"I've been flying Delta since 1984.  It has been my airline of choice as I live in Atlanta where they are based.  Like most airlines, they have been increasingly disappointing over the years as legroom has shrunk and food has all but disappeared. Otherwise, they do quite well with punctuality, cleanliness, and attentiveness in-flight."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Short and nice trip,"Nice and short flight. Good plane, available entertainment. Departure and landing on time. Just water and snack as courtesy, if they also provides the option of soda or juice will be great."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Very good flight,"Flight was good cannot complain i think service was for ehat i pay for , i think i got more of what i was suppose to get"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,"For domestic travel, I'm a Delta convert","I'm not quite sure why, but the two airlines that have been my default choices have always United and JetBlue. But my last few flights on Delta have made me a convert. My experience has been that the service is superior, planes are cleaner and better maintained, boarding and deplaning more efficient, and upgrading to Comfort+, their premium economy, is reasonably priced for the increased amenities. I've read that Delta is trying to reposition themselves as a more premium brand in the US market; in my experience, they're providing just that."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Excellent in-flight service,"Delta has really stepped up their game!  I was in regular economy class on this flight, so no special treatment, just their new, standard in-flight service.  Once boarding was complete and before take off the flight attendants came through with menus, amenity kits and headphones.  Shortly after take off we were served a welcome cocktail, it was a bellini which was then followed by hot towel service.  The menu had three options on it, one was vegetarian. I, however, had pre-ordered a vegan meal which was very good and different from their usual vegan meal.  Drinks were served before and during and after dinner service.  Another difference I noticed was that we were all given table clothes with our cutlery in it.  This was a nice touch but it was passed out too early, it should have been given right before serving dinner.  Also, instead of the normal airplane food tray, we were given modern designed plates and the choice of food was served on top of that.  After dinner, desert was served.  About an hour prior to landing we were served breakfast.I slept most of the flight but there was a great selection of movies and series available as part of the entertainment studio.  Since I am a T-Mobile customer, I was also able to take advantage of one hour of free WiFi and free messaging throughout the flight.One thing that hasn't changed is the friendliness of the flight crew.Before my flight, I took advantage of my Delta Skymiles Amex discount for access to the new Sky Lounge at JFK terminal 4.  The lounge is beautiful, there was an extensive buffet, and to my delight there were several vegan options not to mention a great selection at the free bar.  With the discount I paid less than what a decent meal at any airport restaurant would have cost and I had access for over 4 hours."
Date of travel: June 2019,30,Pick your seats wisely,"We flew economy plus.  Don't sit in the back row of economy plus, the seats do not recline as much as others in the cabin"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,GOOD but UPGRADE,"The crew was very good and the comfort was good, but I got upgraded to a middle seat from a exit row window seat. the good news is, the new Delta rules allow one to exempt out of middle seats (thank you Delta)."
Date of travel: May 2019,40,Easy with perks,"We fly Delta as often as possible due to seat space Sky Miles and the perks involved--have only encountered one cranky attendant and one delay in the last 8-10 years with them. We do not fly as frequently after retirement, but do enjoy their usability and planes. Might go Platinum as we are planning a couple of adventures that could make use of the extra perks. My husband has braces on both legs and they always board us before 1st class!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Flight to vegas,"We have been Delta flyers for years, Delta does a wonder job, I have alway had a great experience with the crew and I find them to be very helpful when I need something or have a question. They are always very polite"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,"When You Don’t Fly Often,","This is a great way to go. Using the website to choose the dates, times, flights and prices are an advantage in booking tickets. Don’t forget the travel insurance; it can come in handy in an emergency or for peace of mind. With Delta, I was able to pick my own seat in the section I chose. I chose a Comfort+ seat for a bit more money. It gave me more room for my legs and guaranteed space for a carry on bag. Not every aircraft had entertainment on it. On the longest flights, everyone had their own television.Since I am disabled and have a hard time walking long distances, I did call the airline to set up wheelchairs from gate to gate. Each person I encountered as a Porter was lovely and kind. They knew their way around their airport and took pride in their airport and their job. It appeared as if at some of the larger airports the porters were having a fun daily/weekly game of who could push the most. For their services, I did tip each of them well."
n/a,40,Flights from RSA to USA,"I had an absolutely comfortable,  lovely flight from JHB, RSA to Atlanta, then Florida, Mexico, Hawaii and lastly LA. The service was really great. The only challenge for me were the staff at Johannesburg boarding gate. They were rude, inconsiderate and really not respectful to passengers. After this, I had not 1 complaint or gripe. In Atlanta, we missed our connecting flight to Florida due to a delay in customs. Once we reported to the Delta desk, we were already placed on the next flight with no hassles at all!"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Good time and good service,The flight was good on time. The toilet was clean. Snacks were as usual. Boarding and deplaning was smooth.
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Delta to Florida,Last minute vacation! Went to Florida in search of some classes for my work. Looking for warm weather
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Marilyn,"Very good flight. Got upgraded going and coming to more roomy comfortable seats. Attendants were very accommodating and pleasant. Arrival times were ahead of schedule. Had super rough weather on our return trip to Pittsburgh, but the pilots were great!!!!"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Road Trip,We flew with Delta from London Heathrow to Minneapolis St Paul via Boston at the start of our road trip. The flights were on time and both aircraft were comfortable. The economy seats were spacious and the IFE was very good and responsive. A great selection of films and TV shows were on offer. The meals were very tasty and filling. I would thoroughly recommend Delta.
Date of travel: March 2019,50,Trip to be at family funeral,"When a flight attendant knew I was traveling to a funeral, she was so kind, attentive and sympathetic. It made my trip easier. Since I had to switch planes she saw to it I did not have to walk to my next gate & a golf cart was waiting to take me. I hope she knew how much I appreciated all her kindness. I wish I had gotten her name."
Date of travel: November 2019,30,So-so,"The flight attendants were old, rude, bored, disinterested in their service.  They just seemed to wander through the cabin with no intent but to be somewhere else."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Atlanta airport sucks,"Flights were fine all be the planes were old, we were given 1 hour 50 from landing to take off for an international connection to Cancun, it was not enough time, barely managed to make the flight going and returning, most stressful airport experience in 50 years of traveling.Worse of all none of the airport staff cared one bit!I've submitted a complaint to Atlanta airport but its been ignored"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Usual flight,"Was a good flight, had room to stretch my legs and the snack (paid) was fresh and tasty. The restrooms were a little cramped, but still a good flight."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,all was well,"great crew and pilots. WE were about 20 minutes late getting out of DCA do to runway congestion, but arrived in ATL on-time with a smooth ride."
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Trip to Rome Italy to catch a cruise.,"Easy to fly from Orlando to Rome, only 3.5 hour layover, and nonstop to Rome.Tail section back rows were served last so only vegetarian meals leftover for at least 50 people who had no food choice. Booked main cabin economy and could bring checked and cabin and underseat bags no extra charge. USB ports at my chair and TV screen."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,A Better Domestic Travel Choice,"Having flown the 3 Domestic airlines . . United, American & Delta . . we experienced the best service and courtesy on Delta.  We refuse to fly United.  Their seating and service are poor.American is okay if Delta is not available.Delta provides the most comfortable seating of the three."
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Overnight transAtlantic flight,"Awful flight! Constant service kept me awake most of the night. When the lights were dimmed, our seats were close to the galley where they talked loudly and crushed cans. Why not hand the passengers a bottle of water and a snack and let us sleep for Pete's sake. My entertainment center did not work and the tray table was not working correctly either. Jet lag is bad enough without exacerbating it! I don't want a full meal at the equivalent if 1 or 2 in the morning!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,The Best,"I fly about every 7 days to different destinations. Mostly American flights (american Credit Card) Over 50% of the time a problem. You can't talk to anyone about compensation just e-mail and you get what you get even when you disagree and you are told to bad. Delta on other hand Perfect flights, planes and customer service !!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Hartford to Atlanta and return,"Both flights were excellent.  The flights were crowded but not 100% capacity. Nonetheless the service was warm and friendly, yet very professional. Both flights departed on time and arrived a few minutes early.  I have recently flown AA and UA, and the flights were OK, but I do believe that of the three major US airlines, Delta is the best."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,"Good flight, better than expected service","Considering how poor service on the US carriers has become, this was a surprisingly good flight; maybe because their partner airlines are still good."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Going on mission Delta,"I was travelling to conduct a revival service with a church I partner with in Springfield and I went on Mission Delta - lol.The flight was smooth, in-flight temperature was moderate and the flight attendants amazing. I loved the snacks especially the walnuts. Take off and landing was superb and on my return trip I sat with a newly wed couples that were all loving and wonderful. Oh I loved the coffee too."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"Long Flight, But Pleasant","N.Y. to/from Israel is a long trip, anyway you go. We choose nonstop to get there easiest way. Flight is about 9-10 hours each way. Getting the Delta premium economy seat and space was well worth it!  Cabin service was actually very good during the entire flight. It made a long flight pretty pleasant overall."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,day flight heading west helps me with jet lag,"long flight with no sleep, but meals were adequate and movies/shows/games kept me well entertained.  4 hour layover in MN was not fun and I got to Denver way too late to drive home, so had to stay overnight"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Flight was great,"One of the best flights I have experienced, staff and service were super.  Food was good, welcome “cocktail” was delicious.  Airplane configuration was really excellent.  Would put Delta at topOf my list."
Date of travel: June 2019,10,DELAYED every single time!,I have taken this flight many times. Every single time we are stuck on the tarmac for hours in the sweltering heat. I cant believe they cant figure out these issues so we arent getting sick sitting in a hot plane for hours!
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Favorite service crew,"I recently flew on the Delta direct flight from Paris to Indy and it was amazing. Not only is going through US customs in Indianapolis amazing fast, the flight also had my all time favorite flight attendants. They were funny, helpful, engaging and knew our names and drink preferences. Probably my most enjoyable international flight to date."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Air New Zealand,"This was the first time with air New Zealand and I will use them again,The food was excellent and the toilet on the left hand side was a lot bigger than normal.We flew premium economy and had an inordinate amount of leg room"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Comfortable Flight,"Delta has upgraded its ""Main Cabin"" experience - at least in Comfort+.  The seats are comfortable, with plenty of leg room and the service was efficient, particularly in view of the fact that the flight was full.  Significant improvement."
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Ok Flight,"As usual Delta did a great job. However, the flight took off an hour late and arrived late as well. I heard this is common for this route. If you take it, plan ahead and know you will probably arrive late."
Date of travel: August 2019,40,"compared to recent international travel, it rated higher","Late afternoon depart, decent dinner and a movie, then 6 hours sleep till breakfast.  It really is my best way to travel overseas"
Date of travel: January 2019,30,"Even in First Class, not the greatest","Having flown exclusively on CONTINENTAL before it was sucked up by one of the other ""major"" airlines, became accustomed to outstanding service and meals.  I cannot truly say the same about DELTA.  Cabin (flight) attendants were ""doing their job"" and nothing more.  There was a big lack of that ""personal personal touch.  This was our last flight as we had moved from Baltimore to the Long Beach Peninsula in Washington state.  Due to age and physical constraints unfortunately there are no plans for flying in the future.  If it has to be done, it may well be by private jet. Our last flight was June 2010."
Date of travel: September 2019,30,What Has Travel Come To,"I can’t blame it all on Delta but it is criminal how you are treated when you travel by plane. First cost is hideously high. You have to search for days, weeks, months for deals that don’t even make you feel good, but at least you don’t have to sell your car to purchase the ticket. Way too high priced. Then youMeet with TSA and get bossed around like you are in prison. You are crowded in like cattle inTo the Delta terminal, in huge lines to wait to board, and then you find your seat...oh did you have a carry on? You will be lucky if you find a tiny open spot halfway back up toward the cockpit to wedge your bag in. Seating is horrible, tight and so uncomfortable. Snacks might as well not exist and the service is usually cramped just like the seating. Delta is who I fly most often due to cheaper overly-inflated prices. I felt so beat up and abused after this flight I don’t think I will be traveling for quite a while to get the memory out of my mind."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,First class was worth every penny!,"I upgraded from economy to first and it was worth every penny! Delta Airlines knows how to treat its first class customers. I cannot express how fabulous it was. The flight attendants were literally the nicest flight attendants I had ever met and their service was beyond exceptional. They really knew how to treat me like a star. Plenty of room, entertainment was fantastic, and the food was delicious. I highly recommend upgrading to Delta First Class (especially if you're flying Vegas and you want the extra TLC)."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,A bad situation made much better,"Our flight was delayed substantially due to a winter storm in Detroit. Our female captain was amazing! She was out at the desk ensuring we had snacks, drinks and eventually subway sandwiches. 1/2 the plane had to make alternate arrangements due to lost connections, and this was done quickly. The rest of us waited it out. We were kept apprised along the way. Once we boarded, the captain and crew ensured we were well taken care of, with the captain buying the first drink. She was so cheerful even though the passengers were concerned about what awaited us in Detroit. On approach, the snow was heavy but our captain set the 757 down like it was on silk. We had to wait for crews to clear a path to the gate and we deplaned to smiles from the crew. Awesome job Delta!"
Date of travel: November 2019,20,SFO not recommended/ Atlanta GA Gate Agents very rude,"Flight out to San Fran was good, but getting out of the area of SFO was horrible, it took over 2 hours to go 15 miles. We had an hour & half delay out of SFO coming back to HSV, which totally understandable, things happen. But barely made it to ATL to make are connection to HSV & the Gate Agent was very rude when we departed the plane &  when we simply ask if she would let the gate where our connection was that we were on our way. She told us we had plenty of time to make the connection & this would have not been true if we had not been in good shape & ran most of the way.When we got to the gate for our connection, it appeared they were still in the boarding process, so my husband let them know we were there. I literally ran to the restroom & she said she would not wait for me to return & would give our seats away. He called  me & I had to bolt back to make it. When I was walking away from the ticket counter, I did say that Delta would receive a review over this. She overheard me & yelled at my husband & myself as we proceeded down the walkway, we don't hold planes for anyone. I find this rude & unprofessional. I have my Flyer Miles with Delta & have for a few years, but never have I been treated so rudely.Delta needs to give their ATL based Gate Agents a refresher in courtesy & respect! I will be looking into other airlines in the future."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,First time in first class with lay flat seats,"Anticipating a hectic and chaotic airport experience flying into and out of JFK in New York over Thanksgiving weekend, 2019, I made the decision to upgrade my economy class ticket to First Class with points I had saved (only for the return flight, I took a Jet Blue red eye to NYC). My flight was departing at 6:59am on Sunday so I had to get up extremely early (3:45am) to take the Uber from the city to JFK. When I got the the airport in the early, early morning (5:45am) there were already at least 100 people waiting in line to check their bags . . . UGH! To my delight, I was pointed in the direction of the Sky Priority check in which was a totally separate area with its own check in crew and NO LINES! I walked right up to one of the representatives and checked my bag right in. From there I was directed to a short cut to the security line and made it through in a relatively short period of time considering it was the Sunday after Thanksgiving. The best was yet to come. As I boarded my flight and was seated in my first class, Row 3 seat, I experienced my first time in a fully reclining, lay flat seat. It was an odd configuration with only one seat per window and either the seat was on the aisle OR it was next to the window. I had a window seat. Once we took off, the lights were dimmed and I was able to fully recline to a lay flat position. I had the Delta provided blanket and pillow, turned over on my right side and quickly fell asleep. I awoke during breakfast when the lights were turned up and sat up to enjoy a tasty breakfast and a little TV. But not long after the lights were turned down again I was back in the lay flat position and sleeping soundly again. I slept for more than 4 hours of my 5 1/2 hour flight. It was amazing. I NEVER sleep on planes (including red eyes). But this has changed my whole experience with long flights and I will ALWAYS try to find a Delta lay flat seat when I have any cross country travel. It's so great to arrive feeling like you've had some rest. WONDERFUL!"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Very nice trip,"My wife and I were quite happy with our recent flight from Sarasota to Atlanta on Delta. Sarasota airport is quite easy for drop-off and pick-up, and with this trip as many others, TSA is very smooth there.  The Delta ground people were quite courteous and were gate-checking carryon bags that would have trouble fitting due to a full flight. We sprung for economy plus which gives a nice leg room extension which I really appreciate, being over 6 feet tall.  It also gives you earlier boarding than the rest of economy.  The flight itself was quite smooth and we landed a minute or two early."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Great experience,Great friendly service with frequent snacks.  The best amenity was the tv screen on the back of every seat. Sure helps pass the time.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,To Rome with Love,Our Delta flights have always been a wonderful experience. Never had a delayed flight or a problem. The food has been totally delicious and quite abundant. They certainly keep you well fed . Our flight crew was awesome in so many ways . We felt very comfortable and relaxed during our flight. Having flown long distances many times Delta Airlines is my favorite .
Date of travel: June 2019,50,Good Flight,Great Flight. Arrived on time. There was enough room. The flight took off in the morning and landed in the afternoon.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Best Customer Service in the Industry,"I travel quite a bit for work and have flown just about every airline available.  I have been traveling for the better part of 20 years.  Most of that time I have flown Delta.  The planes are in great shape and most of them have the technology upgrades you want to see while in flight.  Their Customer Service is second to none and I have never had a bag lost or damaged in allmost 15 years of flying with them.  There are cheaper choices, but I choose quality over price."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Very good flight,"We used to fly Business class for the seats as i have serious problems with my knees, service related. The cost was just too much so we decided to try the comfort plus and found both the cost and the seats were just as accommodating to my needs as Business class.  If you have similar needs I would suggest comfort plus seats and pay the extra cost."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Very lame service,"I flew a round trip from Green Bay, Wi to Las Vegas on Delta. Never will fly delta again. Comfort class had 15 empty seats, economy had only about 15 of us. Asked to upgrade at the gate, they said no upgrades. The last time I flew with United Airlines, they upgraded me to first class for free because it wasn’t full. Also flight was delayed 45 min with no communication as to what is going on or how long the delay was going to last. And $9 for a cheap beer. I’ll stick with United and American."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Amazing airlines and an amazing experience,"This airline shocked me to how good they are... from the plane to the staff to the food etc was just 5star. Would definitely fly delta again over most airlines. There standards for customer service is great. Peach Bellini upon welcome, hot towels throughout the flight, choice of starters and main. To finish off with Ben and Jerry’s ice cream. The beer was perfectly chilled too. Thanks delta see you in the near future again. Thanks for making the end of our holiday still enjoyable."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Coach seems to have an upgrade on international flights,"My flight schedule was quite long , Sarasota, Atlanta, Amsterdam and then to Stockholm., and later on to Romania and then back home.I really was comfortable with plenty of room, and the service level was quite good. I flew Delta comfort, for work, and it was great. I would recommend."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great flight,Flight was on time and people were professional and curtious. The flight attendant was quick to help.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Xxxxx,The flight was smooth and we arrived early. The airline staff was excellent. There was plenty of room on the plane.
Date of travel: November 2019,30,"Good flight, why can't airlines make travel more comfortable?","Besides the regular lack of space, service was fine. We found the employees on Delta to be friendly and accommodating."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Good in every way,I booked this flight at lowest cost w no assigned seating til check in. I anticipated being seated apart from my wife but figured it’s only 90 minutes so no big deal. When we checked in at the gate we got comfort plus seating! Together!! Flight was almost 30 minutes early arriving at Medford. I’m guessing it was luck but it works for me
Date of travel: September 2019,10,Plane almost 3 hours late leaving SeaTac. Someone forgot to sign off on some work to the aircraft.,3 hour delay leaving SeaTac (air line fault not weather). Missed our connecting flight in Salt Lake. Had to wait at Salt Lake terminal 12 hrs. for a red eye flight (11:50PM) to Atlanta to get a 6AM flight back to Des Moines. We arrived in Des Moines 20 hrs. late & missed an important mtg.
Date of travel: December 2019,30,adequate but nothing special,Flight attendants looked rather bored.    Not enough headphones were on board for all of the passengers.   Not many first-rate movies
Date of travel: December 2019,50,A most surprisingly pleasant flight.,We have flown many times and all over the world and have only experienced one other flight as pleasant as this one. The plane was very clean and well supplied and the staff was very accommodating.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Would rather Drive 700 miles,"First problem with flying is the Brainless TSA employees and they seem to have gotten lazier and dumber over the years. Always have the same problem. My 76 year old wife has a titanium knee. First we go through the X ray (hold your arms above your head) then they wand my wife she explains the Knee ( They don't give a crap). Then they do a body search ""pat Down"" then they actually wipe this product over her hands ""looking for gun powder residue. Then we can run for our flight. The flights are constantly booked full or over booked.  You get on the plane loaded in like cattle. You have to deal with many people Coughing & Sneezing, Blowing their noses. Yuck.?? My car is cleaner and not crowded."
Date of travel: June 2019,50,Transatlantic smooth flying,"Very good flight, service was good, food was really unexpectedly good!  On time and easy to get through customs.  Have booked Delta roundtrip from Tampa to Sydney, Australia for Dec 2019. Not doing 1st class because my husband's shoulders are too broad for him to lay down completely flat.  He said he felt like he was in an MRI closed type! I had no such problems but then again I'm only 5'2"" weighing 95 pounds! We're trying Comfort+ from TPA to LAX, Premium Select from LAX to SYD this trip.  Will review after returning in February."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Onboard Service was good and flight was on time,"When flying on Delta run planes, I am usually satisfied with the service but when flying on Delta schedules on different partner companies, I am not ."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great Customer Service Example,"In November I fly to Kansas City to visit with children and grandchildren. I flew Delta for this trip. I typically fly AA and have status with them.The entire Delta experience was one of the best flying experiences I’ve had in the past 20 years. My flights going to KC we’re on time (connection in Atlanta) and the service on board was exceptional. The pilot even took time to say hello and make sure everyone was having a could day. On the way back our flight from KC was delayed for a maintenance issue. This is where Delta really rose to the occasion. They automatically started rescheduling people who they knew would miss their connections and watching those who might miss theirs. They kept everyone on board and later in the gate area what their status was. By the way, their application also tracks in detail where your luggage is during the flight and stops at interim airports!I was very satisfied with the whole process and I have to say that flight delays do not normally leave me feeling calm!Thank you Delta Airlines!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,detroit to cancun delta,"nothing special, teeny tiny seat, barely enough room.plane was hot.service was good.flight was on time."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,We Had Six Good Flights on Delta,We choose Delta because we could connect between several cities.  We had six flights on a recent trip from Maine to Roanoke to Charleston to Atlanta.  All of the flights were good with excellent service at all points from checking in to boarding.  We would recommend Delta to all our family and friends.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Mostly on time,"Mostly on time. When transferring in Amsterdam, it’s somewhat confusing, but they worked it through. Lots of walking in Amsterdam"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Delta Always Delivers,"I often fly from Orlando to Atlanta for meetings.  Getting on Delta is like an old friend, always there, always reliable, and always a comfortable experience.  From the Skyclub lounge where the service is always great, and they greet you with food and some nice wine, to the friendly flight attendants on every flight.  I sound like a commercial, but I don't work for them, it's just been my experience.  Highly recommended."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Very good experience on a quick business trip,"As always I had a great flight for a quick business trip which was comfortable, and with plenty of room.  I always enjoy the in-flight entertainment and the flight crew was amazing.  The flight in the morning was delayed due to snow storm, however, the crews worked fast to get us up and going.  To top it off the flight attendants went around assisting people who needed new connecting flights during the flight so they could rest at ease about what to do when they land.  Amazing service as always!"
Date of travel: November 2019,20,Drive or take the train if you can,"Booked my flight in March of this year Delta made numerous modifications to my schedule that were inconvenient and the last one they made resulted in missing our connection and losing a day of vacation. Overbooking, changed flights, airports that are practically impossible to make your way through, and long security lines have corrupted what used to be an enjoyable experience. Fly 1st class? One way fares for this flight from Greenville, SC to Maui run $2500 one way."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Long but good flight.,"Long flight via New York, Los Angeles to Honolulu, arrived reasonably fresh, loved the layout of the airport at Honolulu. Rental vehicle transport quick and efficient. Premier economy seats were comfortable spacious. Service was good. Choice of films was immense. It was 3 different flights."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Just another flight,"Was disappointed that the smaller and older aircraft on this flight (both ways did not have the in-flight entertainment screens as most of the flights I have been on recently do. The flight was packed and was delayed both to Philadelphia due a a crew issue and returning to Minneapolis due to a crew/plane issue. I fly almost exclusively Delta, but was not super impressed with this trip."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Delta - Sun Country - KLM - Air France Trip to Italy/USA,"I always fly Delta/Air France/KLM so my preference may be considered a bias.  Having said that, these airlines have always treated me well and my experiences with them has been, for the most part, good.  I had heard bad things about Sun Country, but this flight (the first hop of a trip to Italy) was good.  I suggest you opt for the extra $$ seat.  The front of the aircraft was practically empty while the back was packed to the gills.  Probably why the flight was as enjoyable as it was.  KLM picked up the leg between Schiphol and Florence and the air was really squirrely with the plane seemingly tiny.  But, good piloting was accomplished.  Leaving Florence:  always an adventure.  We were, as it usually goes, late.  A lot late.  Air France flew this part of the journey.  The attendents were wonderful and they even moved me to business/first class toward the end of the flight so I could make my connection at DeGaulle.  Bad news was, the directions for transfer were vague and incorrect to some extent.  So I ended up running (I'm old.  It's hard to run.)...  But caught plane and flight was good.  (Air France always has great food.)  My luggage decided they wanted to stay in Paris, however.  I (the human) flew back into USA through Seattle.  Wonderful Customs Entry Point!  (Stay away from re-entering the country throughy Salt Lake City - horrible, understaffed and confusing in SLC.)  As to the errant suitcases, the process was actually painless.  Delta Baggage claim in SF was efficient and gracious.  They delivered the bags to the door of the place I was staying within a reasonable time.  (One suitcase wanted to fly Delta, the other wanted to fly Air France...obnoxious valises!)  And the delivery was tracked online.  Very 21st century.  I have flown other international airlines, but have always had good experiences with Delta/AF/KLM.  Disclaimer: leg room and seat room is horrible on any airline, so I usually look for the Boeing planes which offer a modicum of extra space.  Airbus is too tight.  And the insane paying for every piece of luggage sucks."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,crew was great,"flight crew was great, especially on the way back to Detroit.  Food could have beenbetter choices,  creal or egg sandwich, both not very appetizing."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,A pleasant surprise,"It’s been a couple of years since I flew economy on a long haul flight. I usually travel with my family including a young son,  So we upgrade.  This was a trip with friends so we were looking for cheap The flight was a lovely surprise! Sitting in economy and they offered a free Bellini cocktail just after take off. The food was great. A choice of starter and main. A nice snack just before landing. Drinks service was good and there was an option of helping yourself to more at the back o the plane, along with snacks throughout the flight. There was a huge selection of in flight entertainment too. The staff weren’t the friendliest I’ve ever encountered but they were pleasant and very efficient If fly delta again without question. Excellent value for money"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Okay service for first class,"I don't get to fly first class very often, but did on this flight back to the states.  I was a little disappointed in the first class service.  For the price I paid, I expect not to have to wait an hour to get a drink.  The flight attendants were nice but not very attentive.We always fly delta and will continue to do so, but I am bummed i paid so much money to get the same service as I could have in coach."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,A quick weekend trip to Nashville,"We flew Delta to Nashville via Atlanta.  On the way there, we hit turbulence and we were seated in the back so we did not get water, coffee,... nothing.  From Atlanta to Nashville, we were told the flight was too short so once again, nothing.On the way home, I was nervous because our connection in Atlanta was only 38 minutes long and I was afraid we would not make our connection back to Jacksonville.  However, Delta got us to Atlanta early and we were near the train so we made it in time.  I had just enough time to buy coffee and catch my flight."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Delta flight,"Perfect service on Delta with comfort plus seats, beverages and food. I wouldn't fly any other airline."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,On time,Everything went as scheduled. No problems at all. Highly recommend. We were a large group and had no issues
Date of travel: November 2019,10,Avoid this Airline if you can,We were were crammed into the last row of seats with another passenger against the windowless wall next to the bathroom.  There was no reason for this as there were vacant seats elsewhere on the flight.  Delta has a caste system of boarding that belittles those who are “basic” economy.  It is like being steerage.  Our tickets were over $400 (ultimate destination was Eugene) and I bought them well in advance for Thanksgiving week.  We have other options and I will not book Delta again.  I suggest you do the same.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Oregon trip,"The flights were full, but travel was comfortable with little turbulence. Saw a good movie I’ve been wanting to watch. Service was good and arrival times perfect. Was the first I’d used the app and surprised when told when my suitcase had been loaded."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,First Time on Delta,"First time flying on Delta as we live in an American hub city. Could not get a reasonably priced ticket non stop to NY from Jacksonville,Orlando, or Tampa. Delta was our only choice as we needed to get to a funeral, so we drove from Gainesville to Orlando.  Checked in at airport and staff was lovely. Enjoyable flight, on time, and decent food. Would fly Delta again if necessary."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,cruise,haven't flown for a number of years... great overall experience!!!! the crew very friendly and professional..would fly Delta again!!!
Date of travel: July 2019,40,"Great service, but they bother you too much during a night long trip","The service was quite impressive, with several options for meals and snacks. But since I had never been on a flight that long (around 9 hours), I felt a bit bothered by the number of times they turned the lights on and off or kept disturbing us with those extremely loud announcements on the speaker, especially if you consider that it was a night flight. So it was almost impossible to take a nap or even rest!"
Date of travel: October 2019,20,From first class to last class,"Purchased 1st class... flight canceled in Munich.... left next day 1st class to Detroit, but then put into coach to salt lake city.  NO renumeration.... they don't take care of their customers."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great Flight on Delta,"Flights were very good, the only issue was fog that delayed our connecting flight by 2.5 hours. Service and food were excellent!!"
Date of travel: May 2019,50,Detroit to Houston,As always excellent service and baggage handling. Flight was on time and luggage to carousel by time I got there.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Always professional. First class service,"Will not fly any other airline. As a former travel agent, I highly recommend Delta.  They are professional, courteous, and works with their customer instead of against them."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,SPEND THE FEW EXTRA DOLLARS....,"Flying can be crazy even if you fly first class, BUT.....spend a few extra dollars and get a Global Excess card, $100 PP, and get a credit card associated with a specific airline ( AX Delta) which gives you access to their clubs for $20 PP. ALWAYS check your bags at the curb and show good tip money up front and they will tag your bags with priority tags. Just this three things will make your traveling much less stressful! I love Delta because they are one of the few Airlines which I feel really care about their passengers."
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Lumpy Seats in Comfort+,"Seats in Comfort+ were not very large. Had a person next to me that was only slightly larger than me (5'8"", 200lbs.), and I had no shoulder room or sideways room the entire flight! The seat (and my wife's seat) was lumpy and uncomfortable. Could not move or shift positions in the seat the entire flight, terrible! My wife left with a back ache from the seat, and I could not wait to get off the plane.While watching football, the player stopped and would not re-engage for 10 minutes. No other channels worked either. So, I missed some of the game and could not watch any other TV channel until it decided to work again."
Date of travel: February 2019,40,Loved the quick option,Loved that we were able to leave that morning and have our toes in the sand that afternoon. Flight went off without a hitch!
Date of travel: November 2019,40,The best of the domestic US airlines,Delta is even a step better with their international flights than domestic.  Upgrading to Economy Plus made a big difference and was well worth the extra fee.  Business and First Class can be a bit pricey on these long international flights.
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Main cabin seats have been made much too small and space between seats is too little.,"I have not flown Delta for a few years.  I was very disappointed in the main cabin seats.  The seats are smaller to sit in, and worse yet, the space between seats is much less.  I have a knee prosthesis, and having to keep my knee bent for 4+ hours made it very sore.  I had selected a window seat because there usually is enough room to rest my foot on the seat ahead of me, but I couldn't even unbend my knee to slide it under the seat.     I am very disappointed that Delta has steeped to this kind of service, just to be able to get more people on board!!!   I won't use this airline again!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Easy Flight,"Left on the Monday before Thanksgiving. I was TSA precheck out of Louisville and the only one in the line. Flight ontime and smooth. Return flight on Saturday after Thanksgiving was ontime take off...a little turbulance due to rain , but otherwise uneventful. Wi Fi on plane was working so watched a movie. Attendants were up and down aisle alot. All around good flight"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Always excellent,"Always outstanding service in business or First Class.  Flights are almost always on time and have never lost my luggage (knock on wood).  Crew is always pleasant, efficient and accommodating.  Seat areas and rest rooms always clean.  The only airline I will fly if they go to my destination.."
Date of travel: June 2019,50,Great service,I had not flown Delta in years.  Going to Florida for my daughter;s wedding.  My oldest son flies Delta alot so he convinced us all to fly with Delta.  The flight was great.  On-time both ways.  Staff on airline very pleasant.  Seats and seat space was adequate.  Boarding was easy.  No complaints with anything.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,New York Time Square,"First time to fly first class. Felt like a king and my wife felt like a queen. First time to New York time square, first Broadway show, and I will go back again to go see the rest of New York New York. Check the double Dekker bus tour to downtown, Outstanding tour recommended very highly. You could jump off and on. Got off at battery Park, see you Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, outstanding tour,."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Delta makes you feel comfortable and not rushed,On ground staff was excellent. Flight crew even better. I felt not rushed with Delta. Very good experience.
Date of travel: October 2019,30,"Flight Experienced from ATL to Tampa, FL",Everything was fine except the window seats that we requested both ways and there was no window on our window seat.
Date of travel: March 2019,50,Is there any other airline?,"We love flying with Delta - on time departures, on time arrivals and great service all around. Looking forward to our next flight in a few weeks."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Flew basic and saved money,Only direct flight. Very satisfied. Generous beverage and snack service. Would recommend if you know there will be no changes. Delta credit card saves on baggage fees.
Date of travel: October 2019,10,Missed flight,"We were traveling with another person who was in business class. When we landed we knew our connection would be close. We asked the stewards to announce People not trying to make close connections to please stay seated,they did not. The other person we were traveling with deplaned ahead of us and made the connection to Ft Myers. When she got to the gate she begged them to wait for us,they did NOT.We were maybe 3 minutes behind her.We had to reschedule for 6 hours later. Terrible customer service!"
Date of travel: October 2019,40,"Service is Great, but you are arranged like Sardines","This is a long and uncomfortable flight. Lucky it's Air-France and not Delta, so everything comes with free wine and drinks. Drink up because you are going to need it. This is a brutally cramped aircraft that is always sold out. Also on the return to RDU you are driven by bus to the far end of the airport and board by ramp stairs outside. There is no covered gate on the return flight! If you can't do stairs, don't take this flight."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,They did a good job and we took off on time and landed on time.  Staff was pleasant and helpful.,They did a good job on this flight.  One never knows how it will go flying with all the airlines.  Most of the time Delta does a good job.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great Flights from East coast to West Coast,"The flight was very smooth and the service was exceptional. I was on a newer plane so my seat had a TV and I watched three movies on the flight. The plane was very clean. The online check in process was super smooth. Also, I like receiving an email each time my luggage is loaded or unloaded from the plane."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,"always clean, usually on time and good service","I love Delta and always chose them over the rest.  No nonsense at the gates, early check-in and away you go. Great service on board and the meals are delicious."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Flight was perfect,"The flight was running perfectly on time. I really liked the way Delta handled the boarding process, clearing explaining the order and offered clear and concise information. The flight itself was smooth. The Comfort plus seat offers more space and early boarding, which is good."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Long flight,Our flight was full and we flew to LA on first leg as it is difficult to find nonstop flights that are affordable. Second leg of flight was on a smaller plane that was not completely full but more comfortable. The trip home we flew through Detroit before catching next flight back to Orlando. The flights were good great service. Would fly Delta anytime good Airline
Date of travel: November 2019,50,From Cincinnati To Phoenix To Cincinnati was smooth sailing!!!,"From checking baggage to onboarding to inflight to off boarding the flight was exceptional.  The staff, the amenities, etc were top notch."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Great service and flights on time,We fly Delta most of the time and very happy with their service before and during flights. The airline is usually on time with their flights
Date of travel: November 2019,30,"Delta Continues to be ""Hit or Miss"" with Service","As a ""road warrior"" traveling on business thruout the US and Europe, Delta service continues to be ""hit or miss"".  This flight was no different!  Plane was clean but seat room continues to decrease in space between rows as well as seat space!"
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Smooth,"Despite this flight being unusually rough because of the weather, I actually enjoyed it. The flight crew did their best to ensure that we were comfortable and consistently provided us with updates as to what was happening. The gate staff was really friendly and welcoming as well. I would definitely book again."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Primo experience in the AIR!,"Delta has excellent customer service, legroom, easy to use entertainment systems and quality food ... it is a joy to fly with this airline."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,DELTA INTERNATIONAL: Seats and Service,"Delta is expanding service from Boston.  Best: Very friendly, helpful, flight attendants; Menu choices; Especially liked the option for a fast dinner service.Average: Entertainment, not even good classical movies; no wifi.WORST: I selected a window seat (3 months ahead, full fare first class) andthey moved me to an interior aisle. No gate person, no check in person, no Club person, (nor I) could access the seat plan. Single woman in myseat was alone, not 'disabled', typical flier, and it was never made clear whyI was arbitrarily moved.  I am a Sky miles member.  Have flown for 60 yearsand NEVER had this happen before.  I am not a happy DELTA passenger."
n/a,30,Not bad..but there are better airline options ,"My return flight from Calgary to Seattle can be rated as just ""ok"". But to be true...there are better flight options on the same route. The departure flight was pretty much ok but the return flight made me rethink on the later use of this carrier. First of all, they changed their gate from one terminal to other just 30 mins prior to departure. We had to rush to the other terminal and when we board the plane...they found that their plane was faulty. From then on...it took us almost 4 hours (with a lot of miscommunication) to depart which made my whole schedulewrong for the day. But to add something good...they have had free wifi inboard which helped me communicate to my family on my status."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Good flight,"the Flight was around 1 hour and 10 minutes, smooth sky and good landing. Crew was friendly. Snacks were cheesies and granola bars."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Flight south for the winter,The flight went smoothly.  All Delta staff members were cordial and professional.  I missed the choice of pretzels as a snack choice.  The earphones provided to watch a movie did not work very well.
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Airports Matter,"Delta was pretty much what I expected,. Flight attendants were nice. We changed planes in JFK, New York, a nightmare! Customs apparently didn't have any idea that planes full of people would be coming through. Then we had to take a bus to another concourse and the bus driver didn't seem to know where he was supposed to take us. Especially enjoyed driving around where the planes were parked!"
Date of travel: January 2019,30,Terrible Flight,Cattle call had to pay extra for seats to sit next to my wife.Got to Philadelphia plane had 100 plus extra seats could have sat anywhere Wlii try NOT to book with Delta in the future..
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Delta Always has great service.,"The Pilot did a great job in keeping us infomed of the weather, and what the flight was going to be over the Rockies and into SLC.  He wanted us to be safe, and make sure we had a good flight.  The cabin crew did a great job in serviceing us on a short flight and getting the plane loaded and unloaded fast.  Delta, trains the staff really well and I always have a great staff on board."

Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great flight from London to Tampa,Everything smooth from check in to arrival in Tampa via Atlanta.

Date of travel: November 2019,50,Delta is the far superior airline,"As always, Delta was excellent.

Staff is always friendly, bags always reach their destination, and there is a huge selection of entertainment."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,International Trip in Economy,"Although the seats are, of course, rather small, the service was excellent and the flights were on time.  I flew home in Premium Economy which provided some extra leg room.  There was plenty of overhead space and the flight attendants were attentive."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Flew to Michigan,"Flew to Michigan for the opera.  The flight was very comfortable, but I recommend Main Cabin and Comfort Class.  No issues and it was non-stop.  I never check a bag but I think it is a small fee."

Date of travel: October 2019,50,Hawaii We Come Hungrey,"Great service. The only negative was that a ""real meal"" was not served on such a long flight. We got plenty of snacks and liquids, however anything else you wanted you were expected to pay for. I'm sure this wasn't the case in First Class, but we were in the Main Cabin."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,The only way to fly,Delta continues to excel at service and on time performance in all areas that they have control over.  They also go on and above to help passengers who have been inconvenienced by weather and/or mechanical delays.  Delta is my #1 choice for air travel.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Satisfactory flight.,I had a good experience flying even when time between connections was short because the gates were close.
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Delta/Virgin Atlantic,I had scheduled a flight on Virgin Atlantic because I had heard how good the service and amenities were but I guess Delta has taken over the route.

Date of travel: December 2019,40,Long Haul,"Having flown this nine hour flight several  years ago, I found that either the seats and leg room are smaller, or I am larger.It was most uncomfortable, and hard to sleep.             Service was great, food adequate, Entertainment, entertaining, and operations on time.Santiago Airport was another ,matter. Major building is going on, and the terminal is a mess. From the old main terminal to our gate in the new wing, was over 25 minute fast walk. Several of the moving walkways were non-operational.Should provide electric scooters."

Date of travel: December 2019,40,Love the new Airbus 220,"Had a Friday afternoon business flight from Dallas back home to Laguardia.  Booked late so could not secure a comfort plus seat, and got shut out of upgrades for both comfort plus and first class.  So for a rare change, had to fly regular coach in seat 23B.While legroom will always be an issue for me in coach (I am 6'4), the new Airbus was definitely more room overall -- especially from a seat width standpoint.  And since the fine gentleman in front of my didn't recline, and the women next to me was average sized, I actually had far more space than I did in the comfort plus middle seat I had on my way to DFW the day earlier."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Consistent Great Service,My flights with Delta Airlines has always left me feeling satisfied. I have never had a  negative experience with them and each time I fly with Delta it renews my confidence on why I love flying with them.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Flight was fine - no issues,"Flight was on time and no issues.  I was able to upgrade my seat location at the airport using the Delta application so am glad that I didn't pay to ""choose my seat"".  This is frustrating to have to pay for your luggage if you check it and now you have to pay to pick your seat ahead of time.  I guess they are all doing this but it still stinks!"
Date of travel: February 2019,50,Delta air from Boston to Bermuda - Direct,"Flight was on time and very comfortable.  Under 2 hours to Bermuda from the northeast is FANTASTIC!  Friendly staff, clean plane, very nice experience"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Better US airlines,"I use Delta direct flight between  PDX and Japan 2-3 times a year because of the convenience of the route and time.  I try to fly with Delta even to other destinations as it is better US airline about cleanliness, I think;  attendants’ attentiveness, on-time flights, etc.  I, however, hope their improvement for in-flight meals from PDX to Japan.  Japanese food particularly in both biz class and main cabin are terrible.  Meals from Japan to PDX are actually pretty good, so I suppose food quality is not consistent."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Business class service,Delta’s business class service is excellent. The flight attendants were kind and well rained. The food was super
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Kudos to Delta!,"The crew was excellent, and the food was too! We had everything we needed for a long flight back. And our luggage was all there and intact."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Europe return flight,"This was a great return flight!  Have used this airline for the same flight in past.  But for some reason this time it seemed a bit more upscale and professional.  Ontime.  Great entertainment, nice/attentive staff. and real food!.  Thanks for another great flight."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Excellent flight from Fort Lauderdale to Puerto Vallarta,I had just had a complete shoulder replacement and they went out of their way to help me be comfortable.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,A Good Experience,"When Lufthansa went on strike, we were re-routed to Delta Airlines.  I was not sure what we would experience, and I must say, I was happily surprised.  The airplane was clean for the entire trip, including the bathrooms.  The service was great. The food was very good, with excellent selection of food and beverages."
Date of travel: December 2019,20,delta,would never fly with this air line again service was well below par not well organised at airport assitance was needed but not very good
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Much better than previously,"This flight was booked as being Virgin Atlantic (they pair) but the plane and the cabin crew were all Delta. I was lucky as my booker had organised a seat in a pair, by myself - in the middle of the plane.  I fly to Cincinnati (you have to take an internal flight from a main airport such as Detroit, Chicago or Philadelphia to get there) to see my daughter and her family around 3 times a year so know everything there is to know about the first lap across the Atlantic.  This time was a complete surprise!  Nice new plane, excellent and helpful cabin crew, good reproduction on the video screen - and surprise, surprise - a new menu!  Over the years I and my children have always laughed about Delta's 'Chicken or Pasta' - but this time we were offered choice on a nicely presented menu.  I had a chicken curry which was very edible, and everything else was attractively presented.  Overall, it was the most pleasant trans-Atlantic  flight I have had in years (I believe I have done this trip around 35 times!)."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Soccer trip,Headed out to Florida for a kids soccer trip and the flight was nice and relaxing. The service was really good and customer service was vary accommodating for my family. Would like to fly Delta more often but there prices are always on the expensive end.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Friendly and efficient staff and ontiime flights,"On both inbound to NY and outbound to LA, I experienced excellent service and very happy crews (particularly LA to NY). I would highly recommend this airline to anyone flying in the United States. The service at check-in in New York was very friendly and efficient. The people at Delta give me the impression that they enjoy their work."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,RIGHT ON TIME,"I am well pleased with my Delta experiences! From online booking of reservations, to check in and the actual flight everything has gone remarkably well. All Delta employees treated us with professionalism and courteous service. The departures and arrivals were on time. Checked luggage made it to our destination without incident. The flights were sold out so they were very full of not only people but carry on luggage. However, Delta did offer to check any luggage at the gate without any charges for those that desired to do so. You may pay a bit more than that of a 'bargain' airline, but it is well worth it!"
Date of travel: May 2019,50,Direct flight - Ptl. - London,Our AAA travel agent booked the flights. All were on Delta or a partner airline. Service was good. Flight smooth. Seating was mostly great although a return from Amsterdam to Portland was in the center and really cramped.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Great new planes. But charge now for luggage,The experience of the plane was good. They are newer model airplanes. But I was very surprised that they now charge for your 1st documented luggage. 30 dollars usd each way!  Even if in the website it clearly stated they don’t charge in international flights. They need to go back to not charging 1st checked in bag...
Date of travel: October 2019,50,"Best flight to Nairobi from DC via Amsterdam,  IMHO","I've flown this flight numerous times for work.  I rather enjoy the long layovers  in Amsterdam....such a comfortable airport, and the lounges are wonderful  Time goes fast and breaks up the long flight nicely.    I've flown mostly in comfort +.  The 747 from Amsterday to Nairobi, seats 11-16 are best, aisle.  Close to the front, not next to bathrooms."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Cheap but great experience,"First time flying with Delta Airline so I had doubts especially because I flew economy, surprisingly the service was amazing, the plane was very clean and comfortable and the the flight attendants were very attentive and alert. From the check in counter to landing in Jamaica was great and I can say I am satisfied."
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Flying back from Hawaii to Seattle,"After a 'Picture Perfect Vacation, the return flight got cancelled due to Mechanical Problem. Had to wait 24 hours and take multiple flights to fly back home...not a pleasant experience."
Date of travel: September 2019,10,Unfortunate surprise,"printed out my boarding passes the night before and ready to go with my aisle seat, only to find that Delta switched me to a center seat the day of the flight!  And of course it's the long leg from the US to France.  Won't choose them again."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Perfect from start to end.,I can't say enough good things about Delta Airlines.   On time arrivals and departures.  Cleanliness and polite staff at all times.
Date of travel: December 2019,20,Delta downgrades their Washington - New York Shuttle,"We've used Delta's Washington-New York Shuttle maybe 100 times. The idea of the Shuttle is fast-n-easy travel between the two cities. Not long ago they gave up the gates at LaGuardia's ultra-convenient Terminal A; but now at Terminal D they assign the Shuttle not to any convenient gate near the entrance but to the new and startlingly inconvenient gates D-92 to D-98 --- a serious and time-consuming distance from the street. Make no mistake, it's just too far. Meanwhile, the American Shuttle has their gate conveniently located. Both Shuttles are DBA's by Republic Airlines, but now American has a far more convenient location."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Quick Trip to Chicago,"Initially I was a bit anxious because it was such a small plane, but it turned out to be a nice flight.  The crew were a bit salty, though, and one flight attendant took it upon herself to be the “alcohol police”, asking me 3 times in 5 minutes if she could take my second bottle of Baileys. I hadn’t finished it yet and wasn’t about to waste it.  I cracked a joke to try to get a smile (failed miserably) then  I finally told her that I would place the empty bottle in her hands before I disembarked, and that seemed to calm her down a notch.  Then as I got off the other flight attendant asked me for the bottle, so she had apparently spread the news.  Never experienced anything like that with Delta.  I was not intoxicated and all the souls seated around me were beside themselves as well, trying to figure out what kind of incident she must’ve had to cause her to treat me in such a way."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Delta Flight,"We flew from Atlanta to San Juan. Flight went smooth for the exception of a few minutes of turbulence, which we were alerted too. Landing was smooth. Cabin service was excellent. Highly recommend Delta."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Always great service and flight,We always fly Delta and never have had a bad experience. Our flight left on time and arrived a head of schedule. Very professional / friendly cabin and flight crew. They were very helpful and asked if we needed anything and made sure everything was good. The in flight food was good and plentiful. The in flight entertainment is excellent. All and all an outstanding flight.
Date of travel: October 2019,20,cancelled flight,Trip was delayed because plane was late coming in to Vegas which made in impossible to catch our flight from MSP to Duluth. It wasn't weather related. We had to wait until the next day for a flight to Duluth. They gave us a refund of $17.11 for our inconvenience. Very poor for a problem that was their fault.
Date of travel: November 2019,20,Overbearing Gate Agent,"My spouse and I paid for comfort plus seating and all of the ""extras"" associated with this class.  My carry on, which had no problem fitting on the previous flight and which certainly was not oversized, was grabbed out of my hands as I passed the gate agent.  Without asking me if I wished to check my bag, she literally took it from me!  I was so shocked I just stood there for a moment and looked at her.  I told her I wasn't planning on having to go through baggage claim at all.  I am disabled and have a great deal of trouble walking long distances which is why I always carry on.  I spoke to a flight attendant once I was seated and she inquired about my carry on and was told it was ""already gone"".  The bin over our seats was empty the entire flight...why??  Because even though we paid for that space, my bag was taken without my permission and stowed below.  This is unacceptable."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Delta's New Main International Cabin service,Flew round trip on Delta from JFK/AMS in comfort plus with the newly Delta international main cabin service. The entire service and flight was 5 stars; this is why i fly Delta!!!!
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Customer service,"Road traffic accident delayed our arrival at Heathrow. Flight due to leave at 0940hrs we got to the airport at 0850, seemed we had no chance of getting the flight until we got to check in. Long story cut short deck staff fantastic took our luggage straight off us and told us to rush along to the plane. Staff were waiting along the way looking for us and helped us along, made it wth minutes to spare. Flight was superb due to great staff and food. Wold definitely fly with them again. Return flight very good thanks again to the staff at Boston airport allowing us to book in early"
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Air Transat Service,"We booked a direct flight with Air Transat to Punta Cana.The flight was good but with no food or drinks offered.Except for missing the food and drinks, the staff was very good."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Angry Pilot expresses Frustration,Flight was great and the crew was nice. Slight delay in take off which was announced that we would be sitting on the runway about another 20 min. A few passengers got up to use the restroom and within 5 min we were OKed for take off. Pilot got aggravated with the passengers that they were not in their seats and which was clear in his announcement over the intercom. He should keep his emotions calm and not express his frustrations.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Return from holiday,"Delta are a top airline to fly with.  Service is good and although no night flight is fully comfortable sitting up, it is one of the best."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Another Amazing Delta Flight,Delta is my number one domestic provider. Their fleet is second to none. Even the regional flights are more spacious than all their competitors. The Flight Crew on my most recent trip were fantastic individuals who provided top notch service. I highly recommend Delta.
Date of travel: September 2019,10,Delta continues to punish its best customers.,"Flight was fine, nothing especially good or bad.  What is bad is the fact that every year Delta continues to take away from its ""medallion"" program for its frequent flyers, their best customers.  In the never ending quest for profit, Delta keeps charging more, and giving less, a short sighted strategy that will, eventually, prove to be detrimental to customer loyalty.  They've gone from my ""preferred airline,"" to ""avoid if at all possible.""Long time gold/platinum medallion member."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Flight to Augusta,"I've always received great service for the price from Delta. This past flight was no exception. From CVG to ATL and the connection to AGS, the service was great. I was flying one way, and both flights were short, so I booked economy. As tall as I am, it was still a comfortable flight, and the savings were too good to pass up. While I'm not a fan of not being issued a seat number until I check in, the rest of the flight was excellent in all regards. The crew of both aircraft made me feel welcome at every opportunity. I'm already planning my upcoming business trip through Delta."
Date of travel: January 2019,50,Flying on Christmas day,"For the past four years I have flown from Austin to Charlottesville to visit my kids and grandkids. I fly there on the 18th or 19th, and return to Austin on Christmas day, when the planes are half empty. The service has always been great, even in coach, and this allows me to spend Christmas morning with my youngest granddaughter and the evening with my wife's grandkids in Austin. Also, the cost on the flight is always a little cheaper because of my willingness to fly on the holiday."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,AUSTRALIA VACATION,Excellent flight.  Departed and arrived on schedule.  Meal was excellent.  Attendants were very attentive and overall service was excellent.  Highly recommend this airline.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,"Excellent flight, arrived early and great service","We left about 10 minutes early and arrived 10 minutes early and I lucked out and got upgraded to first class so it was a happy flight.  It was a well-organized boarding process for a flight originating in Cancun which can be kind of sketchy at times. The flight attendants were very good which is generally the case on Delta. I really like Delta's entertainment system and was able to watch a movie and occasionally switch over to live TV to check on the NFL games.  Clearing customs at DTW was a breeze.  All in all, a good experience."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Great flight to Barcelona,My wife and I flew Delta for the first time from Houston to JFK and then JFK to Barcelona Spain.  The service on board both flights were great.  The extra leg room was worth the additional price.  The food was good the stewardess was friendly and attentive.  My wife lost left her kindle on one of the flights and Delta found it and as soon as we got home they sent it to us.  We highly  recommend Delta for your next flight.Ron Bryant
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Delta in OCT,"Tried to upgrade to 1st Class (couldn't) and tried to purchase 1st Class (couldn't); however that was due to bundling of hotel & airfare so we were told. What the check in agent did do though was give my friend & I sole row seating and some drink tickets which made our trip to Vegas very relaxing. I'm a big guy and this allowed sufficient leg room. Very appreciative to Delat, great flight."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Delta Paris to RDU,"I've taken this flight a few times, returning from Europe to the east coast, a direct flight is always easier. Delta's direct from Paris to RDU is a great service, this flight in November 2019 was very comfortable and the attendants did a great job."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Dependable and great service,"On time, alerts on my phone when needed, and kind servers on board.  Beverage choices are great, upgrades are really good and I get them frequently.  In flight entertainment is good."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Excellent Experience,"Excellent people, customer service was amazing and the pilot even came out and talked with everyone prior to the flight. Everyone is always so positive on Delta. I don't like to use any other airline!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Love Delta,I always choose Delta every time is perfect for me to get where I waiting go. I’ve flown with others obviously I just really like the service and friendliness of Delta staff thank you
Date of travel: October 2019,40,On Time Service,I always appreciate on time flights that have a good cabin crew who is very service oriented. I make this trip twice a year and appreciate when I get good service (both from Delta as well as their partner KLM).
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Flight from Ft. Lauderdale to Detroit,"The seats at the back of the plane on the way to Detroit were cramped but overall both flights were good, on time and the crew was great. Will use Delta again. Paid about $240 plus 1 checked bag, (I hate carrying stuff when flying)"
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Trip from Texas to Michigan,Our trip from Austin to Detroit was comfortable and pleasant.  The flight attendants were attentive and the flight smooth.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Comfort+ is worth the price,Just flew comfort+ from Narita to Seattle. The service was excellent. The extra seat space really made a difference. Was nice to have meal selection and served first. All drinks were complimentary. Boarding was priority and overhead space reserved. Definitely worth the extra price for this long overseas flight.
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Excellent Airline that should also lead in sustainability,"Service Level and comfort of a very high standard and for this reason the company should also make it's meals more sustainable, as they use an incredible amount of plastic and there is a big waste of food due to the fact that trays are pre-packed. If people could choose what to take on their trays, there would be less waste. Therefore it would be good if the company could investigate more sustainable packaging and also ways to limit waste. Going completely plastic free would make them even more a leader in their segment."
Date of travel: November 2019,20,Never will fly Delta Again,You have to check your Bags in terminal 2 but your gate is in terminal 3. We felt like sardines packed in a can. The seats were meant for dolls and the airline picks them for you. And oh by the way bags are 30$
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Delta is the best !,"Delta all the way for me ! Their flights board early, staff is really great and take huge pride in what they do. Facilities are awesome too. I was a United loyalist and they lost me with a ""do not care"" attitude and several poor experiences."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,First trip needing wheelchair help,"This was the stop-over flight on a recent vacation trip.  This was also the first trip where we needed wheelchair assistance for a family member who can no longer walk long distances.  Delta did a great job of having the wheelchair personal there on 3 out of 4 of our flights.  One flight, the leg mentioned above, did not have a wheelchair waiting but they quickly got one and we made our connection with a couple of minutes to spare even though we had to get from gate b area to gate e area in Atlanta in about 45 minutes after our first flight was delayed by about 15 minutes.  (I will now plan no shorter layovers than 1.5 hours instead of my previous 1 hr rule.)  All the wheelchair helpers we encountered were very polite and super helpful.  It made this first experience good enough to know we can still comfortably travel (with the caveat of more time in-between flights in major hubs.)"
Date of travel: June 2019,50,Smooth Flight,"Flight was smooth and on-time. No issues. Tickets were affordable. Nothing notable, but a nice experience. I would recommend Delta. My family will use them again."
Date of travel: March 2019,40,Making the best of a very long trip!,Delta does a nice job. They keep you well informed if there are any delays. Customer service reps are polite and efficient. We’ve been happy with Delta vs other carriers.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,another great Delta Flight!,"I always fly Delta to Las Vegas..... I usually depart from NYC -kennedy airport.The Delta sky club is great at Terminal 2 and 4 at JFK. I never have any issues with Delta and really like their frequent Flyer program I f you get the Delta American express card, You can avoid the baggage fees for you and your companions. I also can board early with this status upgrade. Lots of flights at very convenient times of day!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Excellent service. Friendly staff,The staff at check in as well as on the plane were very helpful and really friendly. It was a great flight. Unfortunately my returning flight time changed 3 times. I had to check out of my hotel at 11 and got stuck for 7 hours sitting around in restaurants waiting for my flight.
Date of travel: May 2019,50,Great flights!,"As always, Delta provided great service and comfortable flights.  I upgraded with miles, so was really pleased to be in first.  Flights were on time, even a bit early on return."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,PSI annual,"Bag check missed because of inadequate service at intake despite fact we got there with 7 min to spare. Special services got us on a later flight. Grrrr, we hurray."
Date of travel: September 2019,10,The worst,This is the worst flight I have EVER taken. I will NEVER fly Delta again. Even if it was free. They lost my luggage I had to pay to have it FedEx'ed back to me. Delta has the WORST customer service. I will stick with American and Southwest Airlines. No Thank you Delta.
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Very good flight and on time,"Boarding could be improved if they boarded from back of plane first. Flight itself was great.  Travelers going to St Maartens should be aware that the airport is still being repaired from hurricane damage. We had to exit the plane using stairs to the tarmac and then ride a bus to customs and wait outside for about an hour. Boarding for the return flight was handled the same way except we did have a ramp to help ascend with carry on luggage. This is no fault of Delta, just the inconvenience due to airport reconstruction."
Date of travel: June 2019,50,Great Airlines!!!,"Wonderful service and ON-TIME flight, without delays!  Stewards were ever so helpful and always bright and cheerful!  Meals were above average!!  Unfortunate occurrence - luggage did not arrive and was sent on 'next' flight. . .went to airport late at night and found luggage in hallway; there was no delivery to hotel."
Date of travel: December 2019,20,Delay delay delay,"It was ok but delayed for 5 hours and constantly told the plane is here just waiting for it be be towed to gate, changed gate 4 times and still no plane, so I was very unimpressed with this, basically I know the weather was poor in other parts but it wasn’t that bad in New York, and I think they were waiting any plane to come in so we could go.  Very poor service all round.  Flight was decent enough, food was fine, but the wait and what I believe to be lip service as to why we were delayed was unacceptable."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Excellent From Start To Finish,"I usually have to drive to another major city for an affordable flight, or travel with stops for a cheaper ticket price.  Not this time.  Thanks to Priceline, I got an amazing deal. I actually feel like I saved money with this trip.  The service on Delta was absolutely amazing and next to none. the service, the convenience, the comfort, the affordability.  All fine quality at it's best.  I am ready for my next trip.  #Let'sGo!,"
Date of travel: June 2019,50,perfect flights with respect of the departure & arrival times !,"perfect as always, smoothly check-in, good flight, outstanding service and good meals on board. This is our favorite airline !"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Return from Las Vegas,I missed my flight back to FLL ( on another airline) as I became ill and required medical attention. I was unable to travel for 24-48 hours and the other airline was difficult to deal with because I did not cancel my flight. Hard to cancel when you are extremely sick.  Delta allowed me at the last minute to use cash and miles and since I was a Delta Credit card holder I received all the perks I really needed for the way. I am a loyal Delta traveler and will continue.  The flight crew was great on both segments.
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Alaska bound,Delta airlines is dependable and on schedule unless there are unforeseen circumstances. They have a good frequent flyer program and free baggage for everyone in your party if you use their credit card. ($50 per flight savings per person)Our flight to Anchorage had pretty consistent turbulence but our return flight was very smooth.
Date of travel: November 2019,30,First leg of trip to Rabat,"They wouldn't give me all of my boarding passes, just the one for the Atlanta leg. Transfer in Atlanta was difficult because I'm handicapped and the airport service didn't know where to take me. Not an easy trip."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Retirement gathering,On time departure and arrival . Clean and comfortable plane. Baggage arrived with us. No complaints.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Fantastic Service,Delta was fantastic for my first international flight. Everything was very simply and the services and accommodations where exceptional. Definitely recommend
Date of travel: January 2019,40,"pleasant ride, all the way....",Flew Delta Comfort on this trip - I would say it's a pretty good value - the extra 3 inches of leg room makes the flight less stressful - I actually slept about 4 hours on the flight from ATL to HNL The aircraft was the A330.  The first class cabin looked really comfortable - 1x2x1 seating in those large sleeper/seats.  Out of my price range though....I can't rate the food as  I brought my own....
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Customer Experience focused Airline,"Flying Delta Airlines in their coach ""Comfort Class"" is the only way to go for me and my family.  Comfortable legroom for us tall people, excellent service by FA's onboard, early boarding, good overhead storage....it's all good."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,safe  comfortable friendly,even after a late takeoff we arrived on time safe friendly flight with no issues staff and pilot were all very professional
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Flying to Anaheim,"Nice flight, arrived early on the way back in Mnpls, and ran to the gate of a flight that was flying out earlier than my flight and I asked if I could switch, I've asked this in the past, the answer has always been, it will cost you $100-$200, this attendant said she could put me on stand-by. It worked out that I got to get on, no fee at all! I was so pleased. I had to go back to the airport for my luggage but it was worth it, especially because my original flight was delayed by two and a half hours, which means my total time in Mnpls would have been close to six hours. Very thankful for that attendant."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Good Flight. Delta always provides the best service.,Great flight and great service. Everything was smooth from booking to returning home. I always fly Delta when available.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,"Round Trip to Shanghai, China","I booked Premium Plus - had a semi-reclining seat, had champagne before we left, followed by lunch, dinner and breakfast before we landed.  It was fantastic in all aspects - comfortable seating - you get a little bit more room in Premium Plus, great movie/entertainment selections, and food was great!"
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Delta Comfort,"My wife and I like Delta Comfort. On trips over 900 miles, you get great snacks. The seats are particularly comfortable and boarding is early and easy, especially if you have carry-on baggage."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great international service from Delta,Good service!  Got a menu in cabin class!  Food was very good.  Best ever in economy.  Nice modern airbus A330-200.  What a contrast from an old tank of an MD80 short haul before this.
n/a,50,Superior ,"On time boarding, baggage retrieval,  food served and overall excellence of flight attendants contributed to a good experience.  The 2 meals were good and snacks available throughout the entire 9 hour flight. We prefer Delta for all domestic and international flights,  if available."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Excellent service on both short and long trips,"Start to finish, excellent customer service.  This was the first in Delta One for us.  Purchased tickets early, so had a great price as well.  Over 6 hour flight was uneventful.  Service was impeccable and quality of food and beverage was a bit better than usual airline quality.  I did observe that the main cabin was treated equally as well as the forward cabin.  We fly Delta on almost all of our trips because of the service and locations flown.  If there ever is a problem, it gets remedied with an email or call."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,As always a great flight,We have been very pleased with all of our flights with Delta.  We use them whenever they are available for our travel plans.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Impressive!!,I have never flown on a international flight before. It was big and huge with plenty of room. My seat was a aisle seat and I sat in the big middle row . I enjoyed the movies I watched and the flight attends were nice. it was my first trip to another country and I really enjoyed the trip going and coming back. I have plans to do it again.
Date of travel: May 2019,50,Delta was great!,"Flying is such an adventure these days, and not always in a good way. However, Delta Air Lines was great on a recent flight to Berlin. We paid a little extra for more room, and it was worth every penny. We (three family members) were comfortable throughout the flight. It was a vast improvement over similar flights to Europe with other airlines."
Date of travel: November 2019,30,No leg room,"Does Delta get like one extra row for 4 or 5 people by having no leg room on their planes? Their customer service is pretty good, as is their app, but the seating is crap!"
Date of travel: December 2019,30,"lots of delays, weather related, with staff honestly saying I don't know. passengers were getting info from airline soon","staff were polite , helpful,  they were not kept informed of changes to flights but were honest when they didn't know something.  turned into a very long day . cannot blame Delta for weather but was not thrilled with how delays were handled. Arrived at destination 10 hours late."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,A decent flight for a change,"The return leg of a trip to Germany involved a connection at CDG to the nonstop on Delta to IND. For once on a transatlantic flight in Economy there was decent legroom and the seat itself wasn't uncomfortable. Service on board was better than what I have experienced from other carriers recently. The only downside was a strong headwind which meant that the flight lasted the entire alloted time,but so far as I know Delta doesn't have much control over the weather. Normally I'm not a fan of Delta but that may be changing."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great flight,"Overall great experience from easy online check in to flight leaving on time and arriving early.Professional, courteous crew. Decent seats for economy and free in flight entertainment(Purchase cheap plug in earphones prior to flight at $1 store)."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Great flight and friendly,"The plane was clean, the crew all friendly and the pilots engaged us.  The pilot on our return flight visited and joke some prior to our take off.  The cabin crew were quick and efficient.  Gate check ins went smooth at all 4 gates"
Date of travel: May 2019,40,Seattle to las vegas,The flight was ok but I'm  tall guy and there was no leg room so It was hard to move plug the 30.00 dollar check bag fee so al in all it was not good for me
Date of travel: November 2019,50,As good as airline travel gets these days,"Flying is terrible these days, cramped seating, little or bad food, delays.  The only thing that sets airlines apart is customer service, and Delta had that.  There was a seating problem which was taken care of by the agent at the check in desk.  Onboard service was ok, service folks had to run to keep up.  There was a medical emergency and it was well handled by the crew"
Date of travel: September 2019,30,Okay flight but expensive,I had to make a last minute flight for my nephews funeral. Most airlines don’t offer a discounted flight for funerals and that’s disappointing. This flight was over $700 because it last minute. The flight home was delayed about an hour but that was no big deal. I was crying on the flight home. I asked the flight attendant for a glass of wine. She told me she would get my card to pay later but she never came back. I had it out and ready. I’m extremely appreciative of her. Overall the flights were good but the price is just too high.
Date of travel: June 2019,50,Excellent service,Had a great flight crew.  Clean bathrooms..will definitely choose them for my next flight out to Portland.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,All flights were on time and arrived on time.  Planes were small and not the newest but service was great.,"My flights and connections were all on time and worked great.  I was worried about flying out of Traverse City, Michigan into Detroit but all went as smooth as it could."
n/a,50,No hassle ,"My flight to Orlando was great . The mobile App makes it so easy to stay connected to the flight information and you dont have to hassel with paper tickets . Easy check in . This trip I was blessed with no angry attendants or ""too busy"" attendants. They all had smiles and were eager to assist ."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Vacation,"Delta very disappointing! Premium Economy was no better than economy!! Narrow uncomfortable seating, see through “blankets”, food & drink less than optimal! Attendant had an attitude, obviously did not want to assist travelers! Would never travel Delta again. We have been truly spoiled by Qantas & there is no comparison! Qantas is fabulous!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Easily the Best North American Carrier,"Once again each part of Deltas service was above expectation.  Their App is by far the best in the industry, checkin process and people first class, and the flight teams are always uber professional.  It is so easy to fly with them, even when the weather delayed a flight segment.Only thing that could ever be better is if they had an upgrade bidding website like Air Canada uses, otherwise I pick Delta over AC and WestJet ever time."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Delta Airlines were Perfect,Seats were ok. Staff was fantastic. should offer free headphones as part of the trip though. those with IPHONES that don't have an adapter can't use the tv's on board
Date of travel: July 2019,50,Delta Airline - Beijing to Detroit Direct,"We recently traveled on this Delta flight from Beijing-Toronto Via Detroit. I was so negative before boarding the flight and thought it would be a typical North American flight, But it really turned out one of the best Economy experience of my life. Beautiful Aircraft, Ample legroom, Wide variety of drinks, World class food with modern menu, Restaurant style cutlery, Sleepers etc. And moreover the staff was really nice and helpful. I highly recommend this Flight. Also, our shorty stay at Detroit Airport was really pleasant, Airport was nice with first class amenities and food/bars etc."
Date of travel: June 2019,50,Great flight,"The flight to and from Italy was superb both ways.  Business class on the first leg of the trip was a little tiring but the first class trip back to Atlanta was fantastic!  Delta, as always, lived up to my expectations and made my trip pleasantly memorable.  Will always fly Delta when the chance presents itself."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Love Delta & Always fly with them,"I have been flying on Delta since they acquired NWA. Their service is great, new planes, most of the planes have personal TV, and all planes have WIFI which I need to use for work as I fly a lot. The staff at Delta are amazing... they go above and beyond to help their customers. Sometime you get bad apple and bad experience, but overall, I would say they are the best when it come to US or EU airlines. Of course I can not compare them to Emirate or Singapore as these guys are on different level."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Quick trip to Detroit,I’m still impressed with Delta service for this direct flight. Prices are good and service is great and on time as expected.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Good,"Crew very nice, good little perks like warm, moist cloth, made sure we had enough fluids and the food was good, unusual for airline food! Good entertainment choices."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Delta Air’s NEGLECT Costed us MONEY and TIME,"Please read Review sent to Delta Air: Our flight from Toronto to  ATLANTA to Belize  on NOVEMBER 13, 2019: My husband and I missed our connecting flight from Atlanta to Belize ,on Delta 2551, which was supposed to leave at 6:15 AM however didn't end up taking off until 10-11 AM which made us miss our connecting flight to Belize that left Atlanta at 10:15 AM. First delay was due to the plane not being warmed up. An hour later,  we finally  boarded and then the Pilot informed us that the plane had a frozen water line. We were were parked on the tarmac for 4 hours before the plane took off. Due to this, we arrived in Atlanta around 11 AM  where we missed our connecting flight to Belize. Delta crew didn't give us any direct guidance and were pretty quiet about the situation. We ended up staying in Atlanta for one night and missed our  hotel reservation  for our first night in Belize. We lost the booking and money paid since the hotel in Belize denied request for credit, we lost a day of our vacation and instead spent the whole day in Atlanta hotel room rebooking our accommodations including car rental for our 10 day trip itinerary. The best delta could offer  was a 75 dollar airline credit (we declined) and our return fight to be moved a day later which we had to accept but made me lose a day off  that I allotted prior to returning back to work. The journey to Belize through Delta was unfortunately and am very sorry to say, a complete chaos. Atlanta was cold so we decided to stay in the budget hotel they provided us. I wish they made up for the MISTAKE and gave us a better venue perhaps closer to establishments especially with the cold weather and not being prepared for that. Instead we stayed in our room with the view of the highway. and spent the day calling 3 hotels in Belize, 1 in Guatamala (as part of our trip itinerary), a car rental, expedia, delta and arranged the booking changes we had to make in order to accomodate to our new arrival date which messed up with the day to day schedule of our trip. As a result, we lost some money and paid over pricey dinner at the  Atlanta hotel  since the dinner voucher was only valid in the airport. We didn't have much option due to the frigid temperature and didn't want to spend more money on a cab. Delta denied to refund us  for the hotel that we paid for our first night in Belize after we asked. In addition, we moved  3 different hotel rooms on the first 3 consecutive nights of our vacation since our resort in Belize didn't have the same available room! We lost 400 CAD dollars plus  both of our 1 DAY PAID VACATION (1 day in Atlanta of our 10 paid vacation) and  1 DAY OFF to recuperate before getting back to work.  We got back home at 2:00 am Monday morning and then had to work at 8:30 am. We  accepted the next day return flight since we needed to make up for the  lost day to suit our 10 day itinerary due to our trip being booked-solid for 10 days  that included tours. Since Delta failed to get us to our main destination on schedule, this made a HUGE inconvenience between TIME AND MONEY. I would appreciate reimbursement of what we lost in  hotel booking for the first night, roaming and long distance fees,dinner we paid in Atlanta and our 1 DAY PAID VACATION DAY COMBINED. We are not asking for anything other than what we feel is owed to us in monetary value while this doesn't include the time, stress and inconvenience that this delay have caused us. Like all others, our time is very important and valuable. We would appreciate to be compensated for the damages."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Excellent International service ,"My wife and I traveled to Italy this past summer. We flew to JFK from San Antonio, TX via Delta Airlines. First time to use this airline and we were highly impressed by the service we received to and from SAT. Delta Airline provided fantastic customer service and their food was very tasty. We had several snacks. Sleeping on an aircraft seat is rough and it was so on the economy flight we had but we managed. I strongly recommend Delta Airlines for not only international flights but domestic as well."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Wonderful Flight and Service,"Flying with Delta is easy and enjoyable. We chose the economy plus section because my husband is quite tall and needs the extra leg room and it was a nice option to have. We were able to watch free movies and the selections of movies were plentiful and good choices, something for everyone. The snacks were delicious and even had fresh fruit as an option which was terrific. The flight staff were kind, helpful and very friendly. There was enough overhead baggage space for all luggage. These are just a few reasons we enjoy flying with Delta. Try them out."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,fly home,"a-ok, flight boarded and left on time, arrived early, luggage up in timely manner.. sat tv and movies at every seat"
Date of travel: January 2019,50,I always fly Delta,"I always fly Delta whenever possible. I have had bad experiences with other airlines. (United always screws things up. Don't fly United."" They cancel flights due to what they call ""pilot fatigue''what's hat mean? Why don't they just put on a different pilot?) On my flight home to Utah from West Palm Beach in January, my flight was delayed and there was a chance I would not make my connecting flight in Minneapolis. So the gate agent booked me on the next flight from Minneapolis as well, which was a good thing, as that flight ended up being fully booked. I appreciate the gate agent's foresight. Had I waited until I arrived in Minneapolis to book a later flight, it might have been much, much later before I got home. I also like being able to have wheelchair assistance in airports. Even with my walker, there are times I would not have been able to make it to the next gate in time (especially in the Atlanta Airport)."
Date of travel: October 2019,10,First time I've had a terrible experience from Delta,"Delta handled the first leg of our Air France booking, ultimately bound for Morocco. The Delta flight departure was over 3 hours late, causing a chain reaction of missed connections and lost baggage. What was planned to be an arrival in Marrakech, Morocco just after noon, ended up with arrival at our hotel after midnight... and with lost luggage (not delivered to the Marrakech airport until the following afternoon). I realize that Delta did not operate legs of the journey, but it was their delay and baggage handling that created the problem."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great Trip!,Great Standard ServiceFlight Attendants were friendly and helpful regarding a drink selectionHad food for purchase which was goodEntertainment System Excellent
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Busiest Travel Day,"I flew home to Minneapolis from the Albuquerque airport on the busiest travel day of the year Sunday after Thanksgiving. The airport was just fine. I traveled an hour from Santa Fe and arrived 2 hours early as advised. Got a text the flight was delayed enroute to the airport. just 50 minute delay no big deal I love watching people and have an iPad, MacBook Pro and iphone to keep me entertained. Then it was delayed again now 2 hours. Broken part on the sky bridge in Minneapolis. Still I am cool. The flight was 2 hours, very slow flight attendants. no pre flight drink and 1/2 hour into the flight before I received my first drink....just a cranberry juice no booze. Then the in-flight enertainment crashed on movies, tv or my favorite ""Flight Tracking"" Now that the flight was delayed so long it was dinner time on the flight No food just snacks thank goodness they had a banana. I usually have great service....Not this time.....The attention seemed to be focused on economy and coach class not on 1st class. I pay extra for comfort and service. I was disappointed on this flight. I said the same thing on Delta's review and rating they sent me....Maybe just some tired overworked flight attendants."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Great food service for a change,"This flight was better than most flights I have been on recently.Food service was excellent, and general service was great."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,"On time, no damage from overcrowding","Though we were traveling 'Cattle Prod' class, the seats were not so close together as to cause pain and extreme difficulty getting in and out as on other airlines. Our luggage arrived with us, intact. We changed planes in Atlanta to flight 2212 without great difficulty  timing was a little close. Passengers with connecting flights should have a little head start in exiting as the folks in front of us were extremely slow in getting off."
Date of travel: September 2019,10,Due to security and customs at Atlanta missed our flight home. Got a later flight that left 1 hour after schedule,We were held up in customs and security my wife is wheel chair bound the attendant who pushes deserted us.  I have a bad heart and ran through the airport to our gate arriving 6 minutes before scheduled and was informed that the plane was sealed. We were booked on a much later flight and saw the same thing happen to others. The second flight took off 1 hour late because Delta could not get a flight crew. I will avoid Delta and Atlanta on any future flights
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Getaway trip,"best airline in the world,,,, great service, flight attendants available for your every need. smooth flight left and arrived on time."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Always a great time flying with Delta,"Delta is my favorite airlines for local and international travel. Their flight schedules are timely, top notch quality of service, and passenger safety is priority for them. I love their SkyMiles program, too!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,good flight,delta has really inproved over timeeveryone was helpful and accommodating with a smile.sky club was clean and good foodairplane was very clean and on time
Date of travel: July 2019,40,Great as always,Never any complaints flying with Delta.  The only hiccup was on return flight - the boarding was a bit lengthy and crowded.  Stood in line at airport for a long time.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Skyhigh Service,"As per ususal, my flight was pleasant.  Service was good, food was excellent, and I experienced nothing negative.  I could have had a few more visits to see if my wine needed a refill, but no real complaints.  It was also nice that someone came by to thank me for all of my business and recognized my lifetime miles.  Always feels good to be recognized as a good customer."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,over the top service when we needed it,"Our scheduled late afternoon flight would have gotten us into Cleveland right as a snow storm was hitting, so we stopped at a customer service desk as soon as we got to Pensacola airport and asked if there was anything to get us home quicker. The rep not only got us on a flight that was leaving very shortly, but also put us on standby for the second leg of the flight, which was from ATL. In Atlanta we were once again assisted promptly to confirm the seats for which we were on standby. In the end, we got into CLE two hours sooner than originally scheduled and we beat the snow! Kudos to the Delta reps for helping to make this a very pleasant trip."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Lovely flight,Was easy and clean and nice flight attendants.  Seat partners were decent nice people.  Had a wonderful experience. Will probably use this flight again to travel back and forth to Maine.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Missing Wheel,"Everything was as expected except the condition of our checked hard-sided bag; one wheel damaged, the other missing.  We were directed to the baggage claim desk and nicely greeted, information quickly entered into the computer, told when and how to expect reimbursement and, with a nice apology for the problem, were on our way without much delay."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,uneventful is best kind of flight,"Original flight and connecting flight were both on time,  easy connection,  boarding process went smoothly, and on-board service was efficient."
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Choose seat location in comfort wisely,Flew comfort and got off the plane after a lot of economy passengers and most had strollers (Orlando shocking I know ha).  Is there is a middle door make sure you’re seated behind it and not in front of it. First class and most of comfort had to deal with walking behind slow economy passengers and it was annoying.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Great airline experience,"Our flight there was handled by KLM and the seats were the typical tight seating arrangements (food was fantastic); however the flight back was a Delta airplane.  Somehow we received an upgrade to Comfort and I don't know that I can ever go back.  The leg room made all the difference between an uncomfortable, tiring flight and an actual restful and relaxing flight (the individual attention to the passengers in the Comfort zone made us feel valued)."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Easy Flight,"Everything was as expected. Despite it being Thanksgiving day and the flight fully booked, boarding was easy and well organized."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Excellent flight!,I always recommend Delta but this trip was excellent. The customer service was terrific and the food accommodations were too.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,New upgrades add to enjoyment,What delightful flights! The new premium additions for passengers are really nice touches. The meals were good and we liked the choices. There were many movie choices. Wish the seats had more leg room.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Computer malfunction delay,We were loaded onto the airplane. It started to back out then stopped. After the Captain announced there was a computer error and waiting about 15 minutes on board we were taken off the plane. There were no real clear instructions on when and where we would reload so I almost missed my flight!!!
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Window and middle seats,"Smooth flight. Great food options paid. Professional, friendly staff and on time. Looking forward to a flight in the spring...will definitely use Delta!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great Crew,The crew really went that extra yard to make sure everyone was comfortable and happy.  The plane was clean and the flight arrived early.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great flight!,"This was my first time flying with Delta and they were fantastic! I don't particularly enjoy flying, but they made the experience a great one.  The food was good, the service was excellent, and I will definitely be flying with them again!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Excellent service,We had a great flight.  Service was well spaced throughout the duration of the flight and the attendants could not have been better.  Well done!
n/a,50,Great flight ... horrible airport,"We had a great flight returning on Delta Airlines from Greenville SC. The pilot and Delta Airline Stewards were great! However, LaGuardia Airport is a mess... and very rude people work at LaGuardia. We had to walk a very long distance from where we deplaned to retrieve our luggage and exit the airport to meet our car service. The workers outdoors in LaGuardia Airport pick up area are extremely rude and desperately need training on how to talk with airline customers ... avoid La Guardia Airport if you can ... the construction is supposed to last at least one more year."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Wonderful Flight!,"Delta has always been my ""Go To"" Airline for personal and business travel. We were given an option to upgrade to First Class at time of booking at an awesome rate."
Date of travel: May 2019,50,Seaworld Adventures.,Flight was great. Son slept the whole time. He was 4 at not scared at all for it to be his 1st time. Middle seat. We boarded early also without paying for it. It's the little things. One Tito's and cranberry to that.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Non stop to Johannesburg,"Delta’s service to Johannesburg is very good. I was worried about such a long flight (one of the longest from US), but was pleasantly surprised. Able to sleep at least half of way. I would recommend bringing a small flashlight. They keep the cabin dark most of the way. So a mini flashlight helps to find stuff without bothering fellow passengers. Sat next to someone who does the trip often and she said that Delta is better than other airlines for this flight."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great service,"I had three connecting flights. People were accommodating and smiling. They had disposable utensils, earphones, slippers, a pillow, and a blanket for the 12hour flight. Food was okay, but the dessert was delightful."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,DELTA  Airlines - Travel from HELL,"DELTA does not care about customer service. Due to bad weather we had to rebook our return flight from Escanaba to Fort Myers via Detroit.We were starnded in a hotel in Escanaba from Saturday to Tuesday morning. During the rebooking DELTA refused to give my wife and I assigned seats even after I requested this several times. Also prior to staring my trip I called DELTA and advised them that the return flight should be rescheduled due the forecasted weather advisory that was in effect. They refused this request with out charging an additional $1400  to change the return flight from Sunday to Saturday or Friday. They were condescending, arragant, and just did not care."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Quick and Easy,"Quick, direct flight from DTW to CLT. The flight was on time and boarded quickly. They did overbook, however, so they started by asking for volunteers to stand by. Once boarded though everything went smoothly. The flight attendants were courteous and helpful"
Date of travel: June 2019,50,Seamless rebooking,"Normally I would not bother writing a review, but this time Delta excelled in proactively solving travel problems. Even before we boarded the plane in Boston it was clear that we will miss the connection in Paris. Instead of going through the aggregation of not knowing what will happen, Delta put us on an early morning flight next day for the second leg and put us up in a hotel in Paris. This was all arranged in Boston, so we could enjoy the first leg to Paris and prepare to our unplanned visit to the Eiffel Tower. The provided food vouchers were plenty. We had a very nice day in France on our interrupted vacation."
Date of travel: September 2019,30,Delta from MCO to BCN,The flight has a stopover in ATL - the Premium Select seats are a joke - not more comfortable than coach and twice the cost.  Would not fly this class again - no value.  Flight was on time - food was terrible - usual Delta class of service.  Entertainment did not work and the attendants did not care.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Nice friendly service,We had a comfortable flight aboard our plane.The staff made us feel welcome and they were cheerful and we were made to feel welcome.
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Take a cab from the airport,"Our flights were very good, I always try to fly Premium economy.  My advice to anyone flying into New York would be to take a yellow cab from the airport.  Uber and Lyft take forever, probably at least an hour in line and the cost savings over the yellow cab are not that big."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,The best customer service I have received in DECADES,"needing to return home due to an emergency and having to find a flight of ORD the day before Thanksgiving is sure way to an ulcer! But the agent at the counter Shad Bryant and the gate agent, Alisa Williams were better than wonderful ..."
n/a,50,Excellent flight to Rome!,"I have used different airlines to fly to Italy and as always Delta is the only way to fly. I received excellent service, the flight was comfortable, and the food was surprisingly decent on the flight! Love my Delta!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Always Pleasant - Great Service & Aircraft,"As always, the trip was on-time or early, excellent flight attendants for superior in-cabin service. Boarding & bags were easy too! Delta Rocks!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Very good experience on quick business trip,"Great service, very comfortable.  On the way home received automatic upgrade to comfort +, exit row seat.  Slept for 7 hours."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Love the Airbus 320,"Very comfortable seats, great in-flight entertainment and very professional cabin and flight crew. Will fly with them again."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,flight to Charlston,"Flight left on time, arrived on time.  Gate agent even was able to arrange our seats so that my wife an I could sit together even though we bought thru a third party."
Date of travel: December 2019,50, Great Service,"Years ago rumors swirled that Delta was merging with Continental. Too bad United swooped in. Delta has provided top notch service both domestically and internationally. They listen to their passengers and keep improving each year. Whether it’s the ability to track your bag in real time, the constant improvements in their Sky Clubs or the ability to preselect meals days in advance of your flight, Delta maintains their goal to continually improve. Between the flight crews, airport staff, customer service, etc. they strive to make your experience always a great one and, when there is an issue, remedy the situation to your satisfaction. CLE seems to be getting more Delta flights, so hopefully that trend continues. Nice job Delta."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Brilliant ,"I have flown many airlines in the past and this by far is one of the best airlines I’ve ever been on. The plane had lots of leg room, good choice of movies and the airline staff are amazing. The one thing I noticed about the staff was they were  of all sizes and shapes which made it more realistic and a positive experience. They were always smiling and super nice people. I also love their uniforms they are very beautiful. Overall the flight was good, I went for a funeral so it was a tough flight. The flight was booked last minute and cost £1k which is a lot of money. Overall impression excellent."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Fayetteville N.C. to Chicago and back,"Delta once again, thanks for a good flight.  The wifi was an issue on my flight to Chicago, but it was fixed within about 10 minutes.  The planes to and from Chicago were somewhat older planes, so they didn’t have the TV screens in the seats. Make sure you have a smart phone, tablet, computer or IPad with the Go-Go app installed, just in case you run into this issue. The Sky Clubs is a great place to hang out if you have a delay.  The Atlanta airport is loaded with Delta Sky Clubs. Food and drinks are available in the clubs. Great service onboard the plane and in the Sky Club.  Keep up the good work."
Date of travel: August 2019,40,efficient and comfortable,"Good entertainment, on time and had the basic comforts. Would fly again, especially at their cheap rates which I found this cross country flight"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Great Airline,We travelled from LA to New Orleans to Wilmington NC to Las Vegas and finally Hawaii. We were extremely impressed with Delta. Their staff were friendly the amenities during the flights were great. We had one of our bags damaged during the Wilmington to Las Vegas flight and it was replaced immediately! We thought we would have to buy a new bag and then submit a claim but we were given a new bag at the airport.I cant recommend this airline enough! As we were flying basic economy we didn't expect to be seated together on all our flights but they went out of there way to ensure that we were.The staff are definitely an asset to this airline. We had to change planes on one occassion due to technical issues ( delayed 1 hr) and as well as apologising profusely we received complimentary drinks .I would travel with Delta for any USA trips in the future.They are a great airline
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Easy flying,"From check in to arrival very easy flight  I was only 40 minutes before Flight , at check in very friendly, change of terminal at hart field not hard , some little Walking , Washington airport and taxi to hotel very easy"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Efficient and Safe Service,"Leaving New York City after the Thanksgiving Holiday is always a challenge.  This was further complicated this year by the impending snow and sleet storm which would result in delayed and cancelled flights.  Wanting to avoid the storm, our pilot announced that we would begin the boarding process early so that we could leave the are before the storm hot.  The ground and flight crew assisted the passengers to quickly board and settle into our seats, and our takeoff from New York was a few minutes ahead of schedule.  Throughout a bumpy flight due to the storm system barreling into the NY Metro are, the Pilot kept the passengers informed of the weather and efforts with ground control to find a smoother route of flight.  We arrived in Tampa on time (or perhaps a bit early)."
Date of travel: December 2019,20,Obstinate Customer Service,"Flight experience is on par with American and United, but Delta airlines customer service is inflexible and makes no effort to assist potential customers."
Date of travel: April 2019,50,Overall service/ hospitality and seating comfort.,"It does cater to the routine traveller. Its well serviced, well catered and well mannered. Options for seating comfort are commendable. Flights are always scary about the stops@Atlanta and delays since that airport is just ba behemoth and one is scared as to where and when they'd get on their destination flight."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Efficient and good food too!,"Departure and arrival were on time.  Flight attendant Charlene in First Class was very friendly and helpful.  I took the first choice of a meal, which was short rib with Asian rice, and associated sauce.  Desert was a disappointment...some sort of chocolate cake bar.  What do you want in a 4 hour flight?  On time departure and arrival, safety, decent food and drink, fairly comfortable seats, checked baggage delivered on time. This flight had it all.  Plus the new Delta terminal at PHX is very nice."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Uneventful and punctual,"Flight departed and arrived on time. Mediocre food and a little cramped as far as Comfort+ goes, but you get what you paid for."
Date of travel: November 2019,10,Avoid Flying Delta Economy,"Recently I flew all 3 major airlines across country..American, United and Delta all economy with Delta being the worse economy experience I've ever had with any airline whether in the United States or overseas. Delta utilizes primarily the 737-900 on this route from Las Vegas to Seattle and thank God the flight time is only a little over 2 1/2 hrs, that is the longest that a person like me who is 6ft 1 can sit with his knees buried in the seat in front of him. Absolutely no leg room at all and to top it off if you want a better seat Delta wants you to pay nearly $120 for an exit row seat that they say are premium seats on top of the fact that you have to pay $30 for your 1st checked bag. Delta doesn't enforce the 1 carry on limit so if you like me board the plane in the rear by the time you come aboard, all the overhead storage space is gone, I literally sat there and watched as passengers with 3 to 4 different carry on items board the aircraft with nothing said. I ended up barely being able to find space for my book bag and had to put my coat on the floor in front of me. You get a bag and I say a small bag of almonds and a half of cup of soda about 40 minutes into flight soon as it's delivered another stewardess is coming around to collect your cup I mean dam you just got to me because you where serving over 140 other passengers  33 rows ahead of me. I would not and will not fly Delta again until they fix their economy section period!!! Both American and United who flew the same type aircraft economy where excellent in seat pitch and customer service,"
Date of travel: June 2019,50,Love this Airline,I have flown Delta Airlines quite a lot over the years. I have never ever had a bad experience. This summer when returning from Italy We had a horrible experience with American Airlines and ended up buying tickets through Delta for a return flight. Every person that we came in contact with from that airline was a delight.  I was very thankful for Delta Airlines after having spent two nights in airports on the ground.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Thamkfully Uneventful,"After October, or so, no non-stop flights NYC to Venice.  3 hour stopover in Rome on each leg, and no 1st class service from Rome to Venice, whicvh at less than anhour is no issue.  Customs and baggage a breeze.  Rome airport lounge very nice,  Lots of shopping but be aware that if you realize after 5 minutes that the laptop bag you just bought is too small, there are no returns or exchanges,  An absurd protocol."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Loyal to Delta Airlines,"We left Charleston WV the Wednesday morning before Thanksgiving, flying through Atlanta to Houston, returning the following Monday. Even with the busy holiday travel season and weather delays in parts of the US, we had smooth sailing with Delta roundtrip. The flights were on time, and all staff were very friendly and attentive. We flew First Class and Delta Comfort, both of which were very affordable, comfortable and roomy. Delta gate agents recognized my husband as a veteran of the USMC and allowed him to board early. He was very appreciative and felt respected. We truly felt like customers and not cattle being herded into a tiny tin tube like I’ve felt on other airlines."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,BEST Customer Service! Above & Beyond!,"We were rescued in Seattle by Delta Customer Care supervisor @ SeaTac today. Our previous airline carrier that got us here, United Airlines (never traveling with them again) would not let us board to go back home to FL, even though they got us here with my ESA dog. Delta’s supervisor went above & beyond to get the tickets transferred over & get us home since I have all the proper documentation for my ESA, Beau. Come to find out by Delta, that the United agent that denied us was in DOT & ADA violation for not accommodating our return flight. We are just so thrilled for Amanda Smith & her team for fighting for us. We are Delta medallion members, etc, etc but she was a complete superhero & went so far out of her way. We are so thankful for Delta & their willingness to be kind humans. We have the last 2tickets on the plane from Seattle & could not be more thankful. We regret ever flying with another carrier & wont again. Thank you from the Gough family 🙏🏼"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great service everytime we use them!,"Plane was clean, service was more than we expected. Free movies and drinks. I look forward to using them again!"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Efficient and courteous,"We fly Delta often,and we've found it reliable, on time,and efficient. On board attendants always friendly and polite."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,JFK TO TAMPA,"I started off at Delta's priority check in. I was the only person on line at 9:45 in the morning. Next I went into the Delta Sky Club to get a little something to eat. The club was empty also. So far I am having a great travel experience. Boarding was actually earlier then planned. Had a great seat, 1A. Everything was wonderful. Lunch was a chicken, bacon and colby cheese sandwich which was very good. The only delay was weather in Tampa. Not Delta's fault. We had to fly in circles for about 40 minutes but otherwise Delta did a fabulous job!"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Toronto to Atlanta,"The flight was good, left & arrived on time unlike my previous experiences with Delta Airlines. The seats were comfortable, roomy & you get served drinks & snacks during the flight. The biggest attraction for me was the non-stop direct flight but the ticket was quite expensive. Price difference between economy & first class wasn’t much. The only snag was the attitude of the lady at the check-in counter in Toronto, she had a standoffish attitude, no smile, no warmth at all. This is the reason for my average rating for customer service. Please note that first class tickets on this route do not qualify for airport lounge access"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,A row to myself...,"This was the first time I've flown Delta on an international flight. I had hoped to upgrade to economy plus, but I was glad I didn't spend the money since this flight was less than a third full and everyone in economy had the choice to move seats and have an entire row to oneself. When has that ever happened? The flight attendants were exceptional. The meals were the usual mediocre airline food."
Date of travel: November 2019,20,Rough flight to Vegas,We were one of many I understand who flew on Nov.21 to Vegas on many flights and had an absolutely scary flight. I am a pretty seasoned flyer and that flight was like a rollercoaster for most of the 4 hour leg of travel. I was trying to watch a movie to get my mind off it and I was being trouble around in my seat so much that it was hard to ignore. We DID land ok but it leaves a lasting memory. Maybe I will rent a car and drive next time!
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Comfortable flight.,"Delta never fails to provide a comfortable flight. However I didn't realize that I had to switch airports in NYC, round trip. La Guardia to JFK/JFK to La Guardia is an interesting commute."
Date of travel: December 2019,30,Flight good - Baggage handling  horrible,We took a nonstop flight to STT from JFK. Flight experience was positive.  Emergency row has nice leg room and in-flight service is competitive to other airlines.  Upon arrival our relatively new  Samsonite hard-sided luggage was cracked.   See photo. We submitted a claim to Delta and now waiting for reimbursement (receipt required).  Traveler beware.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Nice flight,Solid flight. Newer 737.. not the MAX... great entertainment selection on Delta flights. I typically only flight Delta due to being a platinum medallion member so my seats typically get upgraded for free.
n/a,50,Another great flight with Delta,"On the road again and it was another quick flight with no issues with Delta. Boarding went smoothly with planes full with rescheduled people from storms on previous days, but heard very little grumbling. Best treatment and seating arrangements of an U S airline."
n/a,50,60th Birthday trip to New York,First time flying international flight.   Delta staff at airport and on flight were brilliant.  I was not looking forward to the 7 hour plus flight but it passed very quickly.  Meal was lovely both going and coming home. The flight home was a bit scary 4 hours stuck on the tarmac due to snow and also once we did manage to take off  we had a lot of turbulence but managed to get some sleep.  The stewardesses were fantastic.  Well done Delta
Date of travel: December 2019,40,On time,"I have had trouble getting here on time, but this flight was on time and smooth. The landing was a little hard but overall a very pleasant flight with on board WiFi for messaging and movies to watch for a short one and half hours. Seat had average leg and was very comfortable for a full flight"
Date of travel: November 2019,30,"Round trip to Appleton, WI and back to GSP","As everyone knows, the regional flights with Delta or American have no leg space, and no where except under the seat in front of you if you are bringing your laptop and files with you. That combination will ruin any flight, but I was pleasantly surprised that one leg of my journey was on a newer jet with great room for overhead luggage, and more leg room. That made that part of my day much more relaxing. Thank you Delta."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Perfect score 5 for 5. Very pleased.,"I have flown American, United and Delta in the last 60 days. Delta far exceeded my expectations by simply doing the basic things you would expect from an airline flight experience. #1) All the flights and connections were on time with no delays. I don’t remember the last time I flew and didn’t have any delays. #2) They didn’t lose Or Damage my bag. Both have happened to me before and it sucks. #3) The flight was very cost efficient, saving money is always a good thing. #4) All staff from check in to the flight attendants actually acted like they cared, were very friendly. #5) Seat placements. Delta actually tries to seat you with your wife. Why does this have to be so difficult? American actually charges you extra for requesting a seat together, I realized I have succumbed to mediocrity when flying. 3 out of 4 American flights were delayed, United charges more than other airlines for bags and other requests. I plan to look for more Delta flights when booking in the future."
Date of travel: December 2019,20,Delta disappoints International services,"My concern was the food services by the crew, there is no Veg options for me and the crew provided very tiny quantity food for me which was very disappointed and I was half empty stomach until came to US, When am not going to meat option, they should provide me enough food because we cant buy anything and just an ice cream,oreo will not be great lunch. As a Delta traveler member am not expecting this and very much disappointed with Delta International services."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"Wonderful Service, It is my favorite airline","I was to fly on my TAP Ticket from Amsterdam to Lisbon to Boston but, because of the problems I had seen TAP having a week before, I decided to change airlines.  Since i only had 1 hour connection in Lisbon, I talked to the TAP Rep and she knew about the problems and said that I would miss the connection and be forced to overnight in Portugal. Rather that do that I cancelled Tap and booked Delta. Service was great both in the airport and onboard. You can not beat the service or food on a Delta flight"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,I only would use Delta,"Excellent flight and service.  The was a 2 hour ground delay to start but that was due to weather in Las Vegas and nothing to dowith Delta.  The service, staff, and flight were excellent."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Nice smooth flight from Salt Lake City to Amsterdam,Great flight. Comfortable seats and nice service. A long flight from SLC to AMS. The service was great as they offered two complete meals and quite a few snacks along with drink service throughout the flight. The entertainment screens offered a large variety of movies and other programs. Smooth flight.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Excellent experience,Everything went smoothly.  Flight took off on time and landed a little ahead of time.  Staff was friendly and went out of their way to see that my spouse and I sat together.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Please read,"At times, I swear I do not think this comapny has a clue what they are doing but I will say, due to family health issues, we had to cancel this flight. A family member passed away with cancer. I called them to tell them what was going on. They were able as nice as they get. They were like a round of golf. I hate it I hate it then on the 17th or 18th hole, I have a great shot and I am ready for the next round. Delta can be just a PAIN and then they do a GREAT thing and I can not wait till the next time I fly with them"
Date of travel: September 2019,30,Seats are getting tighter and leg room lessened; food quality is not there,I really don't mind the long flights but would like a little creature comfort.  Wrapped up like a pretzel is not one of them.  But enough about being twisted into a Gordian Knot.  What really irks me is the fact that the quality of the food served on international flights has dropped significantly.  I am truly surprised as one would think that American flag carriers would try to somewhat match the service provided by foreign flag carriers.  Sadly not.  You travel with us; you accept what we offer.  Que sera sera.
Date of travel: October 2019,10,Absolute shambols,"Booked business class flights for special trip to NY, flights on the way out were good.Concern was that, at time of booking, only one seat was allocated with the other to be allocated at gate.This turned out to be because three seats were blocked off for use by the pilots who, in the end, only used one.Seats were allocated at the gate but there were three different couples allocated seats that were not together when it could easily have been done properly.Caused a bit of chaos on the flight and managed to get seats sorted, but it simply should have been done correctly by Delta.Staff on flight were most apologetic and great but Delta simply couldn’t care and don’t see what they’ve done wrong.First time flying Delta, but obviously the last too."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Smooth Flight,"My first trans-Atlantic flight with Delta was generally a pleasant experience. The Comfort class cabin was not as comfortable as I expected and service was barely different from the main economy cabin. The flight itself passed as a breeze, all 11 hours from Lagos to Atlanta. Kudos to the Captain and Cabin staff were professional and very friendly."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Awful fees. $400 for my wife and I to switch our honeymoon flight.,"My wife and I had to pay $830 total ($400 in fees and $430 in fare changes) to change our flight. Not to mention that travel insurance was purchased and the original flight was swapped with a lengthy layover. We understand that fares change, but this was a large expense to start our marriage and soured a generous honeymoon gift. Customer service was apathetic as could be. Cookies and entertainment in flight don't warrant the difference in flight."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Will  is horrible,"Will  on flight DL 1224 was so disrespectful and rude to the first class customers that everyone in first class was talking about it....... when someone asked for something he always replied with a negative statement such as hurry up and drink that or I can’t serve you until we’re in the air, then once we’re in the air and same item requested he wouldn’t serve because we were in air ..... Made absolutely no sense"
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Js,"Service desk very competent and friendly, boarding seamless and well organized. Flight staff helpful and friendly"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Delta keeps impressing,"Delta keeps impressing with their clean flights, great person entertainment centers and amazing service. I love flying delta."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Surprisingly excellent,"I usually fly Alitalia on this route and usually avoid US carriers on international flights because most foreign carriers offer better service.  The last time I flew Delta business class my feet were in a small box-like area, which made it impossible to move - or sleep.  However, I was extremely happy with this flight and will start flying Delta on this route, which I think has now outperformed Alitalia, particularly since Alitalia is having problems and has cut back services.The seat is very comfortable and the lay out is great - 1-2-1.  The pillow is a real pillow which also makes sleep better.  The food was excellent.  And unlike in the past, the champagne was real and the wine was very good.  Service was also excellent - with several Italian speaking attendants on board. I was really impressed and as a very frequent long distance flyer, I'll start flying Delta when possible."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Awesome,"We traveled from Manchester airport to jfk by delta airline what a fabulous service, Considering We was in economy we was treated very well indeed the staff were amazing and the flight was smooth and perfect best air line I’ve ever travelled with 10/10"
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Flying isn't fun,"seats too small, and I am  small myself.boarding too slow. Too many different groupsfood service sub standard.need I say more?"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great Nonstop service,"Excellent service in F/C. Seats comfortable and the food was good. The Flight attendant was courteous, friendly and attentive.  The 737-900 inflight entertainment was good. Look forward to flying F/C with Delta again."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Delta Airlines ,The flight went very smooth and even arrived at our destination a little sooner than expected. Security at the airport also goes pretty smoothly. I would recommend this airline.
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Beyond awful ,Going to Jamaica. The ground crew forgot to close the water line so no coffee and hand sanitizer in the bathroom. Crew did their best coming back there were 2 couples not seated together I asked Asif the head steward about playing what I called music seats. He said once we take off then at that point he can’t do that. Plus my seat was broad was my tray. I still JSU’s one miles. Will never travel delta again gave my miles to make a wish. Years ago they left me at the gate because pilot pulled back early. Easily the worst airline
n/a,50,Getting It Right,"Flew American airlines two weeks ago from San Juan to Buffalo... between cancellations and standby, it took two days to get home from San Juan...took a Delta flight round trip from Buffalo to Salt Lake City, and I must say, Delta gets it right.  Every 30 minutes, a Steward comes around with complimentary water or coffee, which is so comforting...plus, my wife and I purchased food, which was quite good....we will try to fly only Delta airlines going forward."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Flight to Antigua,"Delta was on-time for all legs of the trip and the jet legs  to and from were great. The only complaint is the tier system for passengers as we were basic. The seats were in the aft portion of the plane; yet, the big benefit was the ATL to ANU it was not a full so the middle seat was empty. I am used to having seats assigned prior when I make reservations on other airlines."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Holiday with family using Delta connecting flights,Should have been Virgin Atlantic but was changed to their partner airline 24 hours before flight time due to aircraft problems.This is the first time I have used this Airline. I found the flight attendants slightly less friendly but were helpful. The aircraft was a 777 and although spacious the seat were not as comfortable as the comparative Virgin Premium Economy. Ithought the food offerings were good but timings strange.Not sure their ground staff were helpful as Virgin.
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Short-hop flight!,"Not much to praise or complain about with a 35-minute flight.  But, can say that boarding was smooth and orderly.  Plane (717-200) was clean and comfortable.  Staff were professional and efficient.  Flight was smooth and comfortable."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Delta Flights were Good except...,"My wife & I travelled with another couple. We were flying in Comfort Plus section. For some reason Delta switched our seats from Bulkheads to regular seats and when my wife asked the agent why, she said other people were traveling with ‘service animals’...after boarding the plane we noticed 4 middle aged persons in the bulkhead seats with No Service Animals!?!  Our friends who we were traveling with, were in a different row. This was not right... the flight was fine, but the explanation of why we were bumped out of our seats was not..."
Date of travel: November 2019,30,visiting family,Leg room shrinking and attendents work too hard.  Food was fair and service was exceptional.  Boarding and departure okay
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Back to MI for my sons wedding,Great service great flight and non stop Delta is awesome and the people at Delta checking in our bags were great and so is the folks running the Delta Sky Club in Memphis
Date of travel: December 2019,50,"Great flight, great flight attendants and service!","We were so happy with the service we received with Delta Airlines from Beginning to end. I was additionally impressed with 1 flight attendant.  Her name is Dawn (according to her name tag) She had to deal with a difficult flier and she did an amazing job! I don't know how they can put up with so many different people and keep their composure! Why do fliers have to be so rude and ""entitled"" when we all are doing our best?!"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Fairly easy,Had a stopover in Salt Lake City with a short layover. Then on to Detroit. SLC was an easy airport to change in and the Delta agents were friendly enough at every turn. Would have been nice if in Detroit over Thanksgiving week they had all the counters open to assist. One would think so...but nope. Will fly Delta again as no major problems.
Date of travel: November 2019,20,Never Again!,"Our flight from LAX to Paris had been wonderful, and we expected the same going back. How wrong we were! The plane was old and dirty, especially the toilets. The crew spent their time gossiping -- very loudly-- and couldn't be bothered with the passengers. One passenger was yelled at because he didn't crush his small plastic water bottle to throw it out. The cabin attendant wouldn't take it until it was crushed. No please, no thank you, just an order or he wouldn't take it. Everything was a chore for the attendants and the food was terrible. And don't ask for water -- they'll only get upset. Delta is supposed to the best American transatlantic carrier. Wow, not this flight. Unfortunately you're better off with a foreign flagged carrier -- there is a better consistency of cleanliness and service, no matter where you sit on the airplane (British Airways, with all of its problems, and Alitalia are better than Delta). And we were in economy plus on Delta -- we couldn't find the plus. It was definitely a minus, and we won't fly them again."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great flight to Beijing,We enjoyed our flight to Beijing via Seattle and via Detroit. Although the flight was completely full it was quiet and on time.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,They really do love to fly,"From the moment we boarded, the flight attendants were providing A+ service to all passengers. One member of our party was not a frequent flier, and it showed all over her face. The flight attendant sitting next to her during takeoff and landing eased the fears and anxiety my friend was experiencing. She told her all about her job and the places she had visited, and inquired about my friend’s career and travel plans.  It was easy to see how she loved her job."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Best Service in Industry,No US carrier can compare to the exceptional service Delta provides. Traveling often I choose to fly Delta as often as destination allows
n/a,50,Early arrival,"I used Delta round trip to see family this year. Each of the four legs of my journey were on time or early arrivals. The flight attendants were all courteous and fun to engage with. One flight was a full plane and the staff were working hard to check extra bags so there was overhead space and that boarding went smoothly. I will definitely continue to used Delta, even signed up for their skymiles program to make it easier in the future."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Easy and On Time,"Delta was an easy choice, direct flight from Mexico City to Salt Lake. The flight was on time, the crew was professional, movies and food were good. I would fly Delta on this route again."
Date of travel: December 2019,40,Great service,"The incoming flight was delayed by 30 minutes - Delta kept us informed and we left approx. 30 minutes late but arrived early in Atl. The flight from ATL to RSW was on time and arrived a few minutes early. The service on the international flight was great, the food was much better than the ones we had on other airlines. The only negatives were that Delta is still flying the older planes with small screens and  no power on international flights and the TV screens and tray tables were really filthy. I had to ask the flight attendant for wipes and cleaned the tables myself. The seat belts on the older planes are also not as comfortable as the ones on the newer planes."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,excellent trip,excelent tripexcelent food and servicenothing to say flight on time will use again Delta on our next trip
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Review,Flight was uneventful. We left on time and got to our destination early. Stewardess were pleasant and accommodating.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,When things go wrong...,"I was on the 5:40 am flight out of Helena. We loaded onto the plane and taxied out to the runway. Then, we turned around and came back to the terminal. The plane was broken. There are only three flights a day out of Helena. I managed to get on the one pm flight to SLC then on to ATL. So many people missed their connections. Delta had to fly a part and a maintenance guy to Helena to fix the plane. He didn't arrive until after two pm. It was a long day for everyone. We got kicked out of the secure area between flights as they sent TSA home. 😐 This could happen to any airline. Delta was good about it."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Very Impressed,"I haven't used Delta in a long time. However, I flew them from Chicago/JFK/Dublin last month (November). The 1st leg was very good. The flight attendants were great. However, the 2nd leg from JFK to Dublin was phenomenal. The flight attendant Shiboan  was super. She was so funny and treated my wife and me, especially me, like we were old friends. I was completely surprised at how attentive all the flight attendants were. The food was exceptional.Kudos to Delta for great people and great service."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Retirement Adventure,"Flew out on a cold windy day to our Caribbean adventure to celebrate our retirements and 42nd anniversary.  Seamless trip on Delta, including the friendliest staff onboard the flights, and no unpleasant delays or cancellations.  All luggage came thru at the end of our day, which is always nice and have never had an issue with this with Delta.  On our way home, the ticket desk surprised us with Pre-check status - Very nice surprise!  All flights smooth, loved the Comfort + seating and extras and plan to fly it again.  Love Delta!  My only wish is that there was a bigger selection of snacks for the flights that don't offer meal service."
Date of travel: December 2019,20,Delta just flat out lies to their customers.,"After already getting off the plane at the gate once for a de-icing delay, we were brought back on as we were told we would get underway. Minutes prior to pulling away from the gate, a number of passengers began getting text messages that the flight was cancelled due to ""inclement weather."" It was brought to the attention of the flight attendant who immediately went to the pilot. Within minutes we were told indeed the flight is cancelled, with no further explanation. One does not need to be an expert in weather, but the snow that had stopped at least 3 hours prior to departure, the fact that the sun was beginning to show through overcast skies, and the fact that I personally witnessed and or heard announcements that many other Delta flights were departing from the same terminal, would lead one to believe they just lied to their passengers. If one plane at the same location as many other planes is cancelled due to ""inclement weather,"" then shouldn't all flights have been cancelled at that point? Must have been the ""inclement weather"" that we experienced just at gate A2!"
Date of travel: December 2019,10,DL2393 Almost Destroyed Mid Flight,"I don't want to say much about this out of respect for Delta but, their systems and processes give me no choice. In short, I helped the flight crew in handling a woman who was under extreme psychedelics and thought she was on the plane as a kidnapped sex trafficking victim. The woman was screaming for help and she leaped, grabbed, and attempted to open the rear emergency exit door mid flight. I forcefully removed her from the door, restrained her, reseated the passengers in the rear row, placed the woman in the window seat, and sat next to her the entire ride as she screamed for help and attempted to free herself. She also informed me and the flight crew that she had HIV. This was my mid-tour leave experience after spending 6 months in a restricted area in korea. I tried to contact delta executives and all of the public emails were incorrect. I tried to talk to delta staff at the airport and they told me to email corporate. I used Facebook messenger and was told that my case would need an internal review but, they will not give me updates ir a timeline on the status of my complaint. I did not post any photos or voice clips on social media out of respect for delta. This is only another attempt to reach a delta representative rust can relay my case. I will give more time to delta to reply, but sadly, it seems that everything had to be vital for an immediate response."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,They care,I am elderly traveling solo on Thanksgiving due to unexpected medical issue. Went to great lengths to reroute my trip from Phoenix. Everyone along the way helpful and caring. I can’t say enough about the people serving their clientele on this airline from the check in to the gate to Need help desk to flight attendants to Daniel in Tegucigalpa who assisted me in solving a luggage issue. They have gained a loyal customer for sure.
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Gets It Done,"Every seat was taken, but we got to Fort Lauderdale despite some people who refused to sit down as we taxied until the pilot threatened to have air marshals arrest them and remove them from the plane. This episode delayed us half an hour.Seats were tight, and legroom was limited."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Like spirit but three times as expensive,"*HOW CAN WE HELP? Very disappointed in delta. I thought they were higher end than other airlines but apparently paying $600+ one way isn’t enough to get a reclining seat, screen that works, or even a headrest. Of course, the seat in front of me reclined leaving 6 inches from their seat to my face. Had and neck pain long after the flight. My air was on full blast and I was still sweating in a tank top. Additionally when I had to change flights, I changed it online and the website told me the flight was changed but when I didn’t get a confirmation, I had to call and confirm. They told me that I had not changed the flight and took almost an hour by phone. Just another airline putting money ahead of customers."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Great disappointment,Additional charges for these crummy seats?? Never again. Exit seats and right outside a very busy toilet sold for premium comfort. How’s comfort defined by delta. The stench is horrendous and not once did any of the crew checked....
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Tendency to be late,"Its being a recent tendency to be late on the boarding time and this time we were late about 15 minutes to start boarding, fortunately we arrive on time , but is not pleasant be waiting on line to aboard. Check In kind of expensive in comparison to other airlines"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Minneapolis to Amsterdam and Basel to Amsterdam to Minneapolis,"Two flights, Minneapolis to Amsterdam and then a little over a week later Basel, Switzerland to Amsterdam to Minneapolis.  The flights were far better flying overseas than the last time I flew three years ago, I thought.  The food and extras were definitely better.  My wife's seat screen locked up just after takeoff from Amsterdam on our return and I thought it took a little long to reboot it, and the KLM flight from Basel had to reboot the plane before we could take off.  The boarding pass scanners in Basel would not recognize our passports, and the attending agent seemed to blame Delta for that, but I'm not sure if that is the case or just bad software.  Those were really the only bad things.  I was comfortable enough to fall dead asleep on our Amsterdam to Minneapolis leg, which virtually never happens."
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Comfort Plus is well worth the extra,"We did not want to pay the extra for Business Class for a short daytime flight, but thought Comfort Class a good compromise. Self-service check-in was Okay. Being on a through ticket with Virgin Atlantic, we didn’t have to pay a supplement for checked luggage. We went straight to the gate for a seat but the area soon became chaotic - lots of folks looking for a free upgrade or a change to their allocated seat; others desperate to board early to ensure they could store their hand luggage as they knew space would be tight. We found boarding very confrontational – when our slot was announced, we had to pretty much shove our way through to the front, as the economy crowd wasn’t for moving. Our seats (10 D & E in the first row behind Business Class) had plenty of space and was also a good spot for a quick disembark. Complimentary snacks (fresh fruit, crisps, pretzels, cereal bars, chocolate etc) were served pretty quickly, followed by a complimentary alcoholic, soft and hot drinks run. Other pros – friendly and helpful cabin crew and an early touch-down."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,What happens when you've  missed your flight!,"We were flying out on a direct flight from Seattle to Paris in September. Got to the airport to check in and the kiosk screen said something like “check in closed.” This has never happened to us in the 30 years of traveling. My husband had got it in his head a different departure time and I was busy from work and didn’t look at the flight times. We got there  an hour before the departure but not the recommended three hours for international flights. We were directed ta see a Special ServIces agent at the counter. Thankfully, we were helped by a very experienced friendly agent. I wish I could  remember her name so I can publicly thank her but we were in panic mode. She was training another agent and calmly navigated through the systems and finally found us a flight to Amsterdam, then a connected flight to Paris. We were originally supposed to arrive in Paris the next day in the morning but got there later in the late afternoon. We thought for sure we would be seating apart with these new arrangements but we got seats together. We were so grateful to Delta’s excellent customer service and this very experienced agent! Delta is our favorite airlines! We recently flew back From NYC in November. Love the free movies (screens on back of seats) bring your own earphones or pay $2 to purchase them and they served us a complimentary lunch which is pretty rare these days on most airlines,"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,"Ok flight, but economy is not enjoyable","No seats together again with my traveling companion on our boarding pass. At the airport we were able to have seats changed so we could sit together. Newer plane, so had the in-flight entertainment, which was ok, but all I wanted to do was sleep on this red-eye flight. attendants still came by with drinks and snacks and we had blankets on the seats. A bit of a bumpy flight so the seat-belt sign was on the whole time. It was ok, but I feel that economy payers are the last to board, last to get room for bags, and not treated very well by the airline."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Flight from Atlanta to Rome on Delta,"Delta seems to be upping their game - I was pleasantly impressed. The food service, in particular, reminded me of some of the civility of transatlantic flights long ago."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Absolutely Great Service!,"I had several flights in a span of a week. I went from Dallas, to Atlanta, to Baltimore, back to Atlanta, then to Raleigh, and then Atlanta. This was during the holiday season, so the flights were very full and I did not have a window seat on any of my tickets. Each time the customer service agent was able to get me one, for which I was very grateful. They were kind, courteous, and efficient in getting all passengers on, bags gate checked and flights out and arriving on time."
n/a,40,Cabin,The flight itself was uneventful but I must say the size of the seats compared to other airlines is too small. People end up sitting on top of each other which makes for an uncomfortable flight. The one good thing is the in-cabin entertainment
Date of travel: December 2019,10,How can this airline be competitive,Delta Airlines is terrible. The planes are too small. The delays are frequent. Every thing is an up charge. Sitting in a packed plane that’s is too small for an extra hour is no way to win customers.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Worst Airline In the World,"Hands down the worst airline I have ever flown on. I am a frequent traveler and yes I rank them FAR BELOW even Ryanair, Frontier and Spirit Airlines. After a wonderful 9 hour 20 minute flight from Milan to New York-JFK on Emirates, i expected my trip to continue smoothly on Delta. WRONG!! My short 41 minute flight from JFK to Washington Dulles was delayed from 9:29 PM to 1 AM. Then at 1 AM we boarded the aircraft and sat on the tarmac for three hours before we were offloaded because the crew had gone over their limits. This resulted with me, very tired from coming back from Milan, having to sleep on the floor in JFK. Delta offered us no coffee, no blankets, no hotel vouchers, or food, NOT EVEN SYMPATHY WAS OFFERED!!! We had to fight tooth and nail with delta over the phone and via customer service to rebook our flights and to find where our checked baggage went. The staff at the airport were disorganized, unprepared and completely incompetent. Staff lectured us ok how we should be grateful that they’re doing all they can to protect us in a wintry weather event. But let me be clear, this was not a wintry weather event. There were a few flakes. The real issue was that Delta did not have a back up plan due to holiday congestion at JFK and long taxi tarmac times which forced us to deplane due to the free overextending their hours. When we finally got on a new plane (SIXTEEN HOURS) since arriving at JFK our flight was needlessly delayed one hour before we boarded, than another 45 minutes because their driving truck had a malfunction. I am a very frequent traveler and travel often inn the winter. Other airlines prepare for this, Delta does not. This is not the first time I have had an extremely negative situation with Delta. But now I vow, so long as I live, I will never fly Delta Airlines ever again. You have lost my trust and my business."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great flight & nice staff,"Overall the flights were just fine.  I did book this trip through Orbitz originally and we did have a bit of a scare when we were informed initially that the 1st leg of the flight was overbooked as we could not finalize a seat # when checking in online almost 24 hours ahead of time and that we were #'s 2 & 3 on the standby list!  After calling Delta, everything was squared away and we got to our Honey Moon just fine.  Thanks Delta & All.  We are not sure what happened initially but it was corrected and for that we are thankful."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Ace pilot on JFK to IAD leg,"Flew Delta (Endeavor) from Washington to NYC and back in October- November 2019.  Flight out was quick, efficient, but nothing special.  Flight back into Washington was challenging because of ATC routing and some turbulence on final approach.  Loved the way the co-pilot greased it on! From one pilot to another, great job."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Delta.... Sucks...,As usual... Late.  Missed my connection... Again.  I wonder why i continue to punish myself by flying Delta. I guess i am a glutton for punishment.
Date of travel: December 2019,10,I’ll never know,"I may be old and demented, perhaps, but Delta must have have the worst website of any airline. I spent 15 minutes trying to book a flight, but without success. I gave ip. I booked the same flights with Qatar in five minutes, for virtually the same price."
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Mixed feelings. LONG DELAY.  KS BORING AIRPORT!,"Perfect flying out of Logan. Coming home was a different story. Four hour delay. The airport in Kansas  is very boring so there is nothing to do!! People are so very very nice though, but still, that delay messed everything up with my entire schedule for that night and the next day!   Added stress that I don’t care for."
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Dependable and Consistent,"The courteous, accommodating flight attendants and the pilots who keep us informed with details about our flight are a dependable piece of why we always fly Delta."
Date of travel: October 2019,10,Terrible flight in every way,"Rude gate agent in Atlanta told me I was stupid and too cheap to buy a more expensive ticket, then we boarded and sat in the plane for 2 hours on the tarmac because they had not loaded trash carts. By that time a storm had rolled in and closed down takeoffs for another hour and a half. By then we were short on fuel and had to pull back to the gate for another 45 minutes to add fuel. By the time we got back out and in line we were 18th in line, so another hour later we were finally in the air. Then came the food and I have to say no airline food in coach is good, but this was the worst ever. By the time we landed we were 4 hours late and had missed our connection. The return flight was somewhat better but still terrible food and they ran out of that! Never again on Delta."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Great Plane / Chaotic Check-In,Delta now flies new 737-900 on the Jamaica routes. This is a very nice plane. Upon departing Montego Bay there were 4 Delat flights departing within a 2 hour time frame if you check in around 12 Noon. During Thanksgiving week on 11/30 the check in was chaotic. Long lines even in Delta Priority Lane. Big issue was 2 large families had issues and held up the line for almost 30 minutes. Issues like this should have a supervisor brought in and the passengers should be taken to a side area to straighten out the issues instead of holding up the check in lines. It pays to sign up arriving and departing for the Mobay Club swerves as this expedites arrival and departure process. The selection of fast food restaurants in the departure area is very good.
Date of travel: December 2019,50,Excellence in Flying,"Delta surpasses every other airline on every level. Wish we tried Delta sooner, we will always choose Delta going forward. Excellent service, hassle free, accommodating and extremely comfortable and modern flying experience."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Always reliable,"Delta is always my first choice for airline.  They are always reliable, have great prices, and have friendly staff."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Delta all the way!!,"It’s been a while since i flew on Delta. I have had bad services in the past and preferred Alaska Airlines thereafter, but recently flew on Delta because it was the cheaper flight and has the hours I wanted. I am very impressed! Service from SEA to LAX was excellent, friendly and respectful. I also left my daughter’s tablet and the individual that found this had returned it to HQ and made its way back to me a week or so later. Their honesty had won me over, and their entertainment option helped keep my 4 year old occupied for the short trip and have me consider booking Delta again for longer flights."
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Mr title,"Horrible service, canceled my boarding because I was under 15 min board time.  I was their 45 min prior to confirm the gate that was marked wrong (Earlier flight).  I said no to a $400 rebook about a 1/2 earlier.  They got mad, no Sky Club, no voucher, no-sky miles, all attitude no altitude.  They rather save $1K in sales then lose a team of frequent flyers."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,travelin' upstaterz: NY to St. Lucia,"flights on schedule, good service, smooth ride.  Note: nominal snacks.  Friendly flight service team.  As usual, announcements from flight deck were very rush and almost unrecognizable.  Atlanta connections were as expected, smooth, not rushed, decent selection of eateries, friendly Delta staff available for assistance."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,"safe, on time and with assigned seat","A standard US airline flight with no let downs is great. Nothing eventful. Just on time, safe, assigned seat and professional crew. I wish lounges in Barajas and Atlanta would be better ( more than finger foods) but I like to go out to stretch my legs and get a full meal. The configuration of the seats (1-2-1) could be better. The middle seats are side by side with the neighbor. I wish they provided more privacy."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Perfect service,"Good services, when possible make use of Delta+ {economy plus]. When you can, try to sleep during the flight and as you have a short stay, try to stay in your own timezone to avoid two times a jetlag."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great changes,"Delta has stepped it up in the economy class. We started with a Bellini! And the food was better, with excellent presentation. The flight attendants were professional and present."
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Disappoitment,"We had visited Crystal Bridges and were returning home via Delta with a change of planes in Atlanta. There was NO snack service on a mid morning 2 hour flight...junk food offerred in First class plus a banana,,,that was good. Service from Atlanta was worse...longer flight, weather delays and not even a snack, No time to buy a bite at Atlanta nor were offerrings in Arkansas a tad healthy. Attendants in different."
Date of travel: November 2019,20,First class splurge felt like middle class herd,"If you are flying from LAX to OGG make sure you check the plane out.  The first class section was small, the seats only slightly reclined, and the area was DIRTY.  Also the service was not what you would expect from a first class seat.  I would never pay the extra $$ for first class service for this route.  I would Check the plane type first..."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Eaze in the Breeze,"I splurged on some accumulated miles to make getting back from a nine day cruise mroe relaxing. Glad I did. Delta whether flying in first or regular treats it's customers like all air lines used to treat us. I required assistance getting to and from gates, and it was always waiting for me, and not me waiting for them. A great experience . Meals were good, drinks were cold and service was hot."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Exceptional Service,"I was surprised by the welcome hot towel, the flight attendants were all very polite and looked like they really love what they do! Great food as well!"
Date of travel: December 2019,10,Terrible customer service,"Horrible service, agents rude and very unfriendly.  Would not let me pick my seat when I booked the flight.  They assigned my seat at the gate, when I request a window seat they said because I was economy I had to take what ever was left.  I will never fly delta again! Terrible customer service!!!!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Best Global Airline in the U.S.,"Delta just rocks. They really have become the clear leader among the big 3 airlines and are noticeably better than United and American. Good customer service, consistent on-time arrivals, and seat-back entertainment on most flights. This is the only airline I am willing to take a flight that requires a connection with and have never had a problem. I Really can't say enough good things about Delta - they're excellent!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Delta Made Our Trip a Joy,My wife and I were on our 30th wedding anniversary and took a flight to Rome on Delta. The flight was excellent and the service was acceptable. The main feature was taking the premium economy which gave us a little more room on the longer flight. Well worth the extra cost.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Really impressed ,"I was really impressed with Delta! It left on time , the seats were comfortable even in Economy Class, the service was great ( Patricia on flight from Detroit to Phoenix on the 30th of November) was just so welcoming and smiling. They served us snacks and beverages 2 times on a 4 hour flight ! You Go Delta ... keep doing what you are doing !"
Date of travel: December 2019,10,FATAL SERVICE!,"The fly attendant Kerman ValerioDelta497 Johnn f Kennedy to Santo Domingo on 1December totally disrespect me in front of everyone and DELTA did nothing, thatShame and shame they have a fatal service! I do not recommend it to anyone"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Another round trip flight to Phoenix and back,"We took these round trip flights to phoenix and back. We booked 1st class because it was only about $150 more this time a year. If I had to eat at the airport on either side, that would cost me a ridiculous amount, so it's suppose that having a meal on the flight takes the cost down a bit. We go down for my wife for medical reasons, so being first on and off the plane is a serious bonus so she is more comfortable. Seating in 1st is good, with 2 to an aisle on most planes we end up on. I have more than enough room, and my wife being 6'2"" tall feels there is more than enough leg space. Don't get the first row, unless you don't mind not being able to stow anything under a seat in front of you. The staff were super nice, and went out of thier way for my wife on both trips. We are both trans, and my wife is noticeably so at this point in her transition. Plane staff have literally been a god send with how they went out of their way to make my wife feel safe and welcomed. The plane was clean, and the back of seat monitors worked great. Each seat has a usb plug to charge devices, as well."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great Flight,"Very comfortable seating, attentive flight attendants, good special vegetarian meals.In flight entertainment was fine.  Nice magazine."
Date of travel: December 2019,20,They took my comfort seat & gave it to another customer!! ,I purchased a comfort seat to fly from Atlanta to Salt Lake City on December 12th of this year over two weeks ago. Today they called and said that they were double booked in that seat and gave my comfort seat to another customer. This is the second time this has happened this year. Since when does a company take a product or service from a customer who has already paid for the product or service?? This is a terrible way to do business!! I am not happy!!
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Improved,This flight was much better than the last one I took.  Check-in was a bit late in opening at the 4am time we were told to be at the airport but went quickly once started.  TSA was smooth as was gate loading.  The flight was full and many bags needed to be checked.  Even this was smoothly handled.  The inflight movie screen worked well and attendants were pleasant.
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Diverse and attentive flight crew -- Food was nice other than the celery.,Flight crew were a delightful mix of nationalities. They were all attentive and good-humored folks who catered to several hundred people for 12 hours. Kudos!
Date of travel: May 2019,50,A pleasant and on-time experience,"Flight attendants very accommodating. Flight crew very friendly. Any and all of our questions/requests were promptly answered/honored. We will fly Delta again, no doubt about it! You won't find a more professionally run airline anywhere! It is apparent customer service is of utmost importance to every Delta employee!!!"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Try the new Delta,"Try the new Delta. I have been critical of the airline in the past but they figured out customer service at every level. The best domestic product. Even superior to Jetblue mint. From gate agents to flight attendants to the cocktail crew, professional, informative and first class. If the planes are not new the interior is. My go to airline. I am planning a trip to Italy and was considering Emirates but now it is Delta all the way"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Excellent,"The flight was 1/3 full, which is rare (we often take this flight), so we both got our own row of seats.  The flight attendants were awesome.  Bringing water and snacks/meals at good intervals.  One flight attendant gave my husband extra cookies that he enjoyed very much.  In my experience this is the best airline out there.  Granted it is a hub in our city, so we often fly with Delta, but experiencing many other companies, we prefer to fly Delta if we can."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Uneventful flight,"It is always a good thing when we have an uneventful flight! No problems, no turbulence! My husband and I were able to sit together, which isn’t always possible. Flights were on time. All was good."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,The Only Airline,"Every trip on Delta has been top notch. After several other airlines, this is the only I'll fly. Flight crew is friendly, and on top of things."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,On Time Flight,It was nice to easily check both baggage and flight online. For a bonus I opened a Delta Amex and got my money back for not only my check in luggage but since my best friend of sixty years traveled with me she got back her money too.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great Airline,"If they have flights available on the days and times I need, I prefer to fly Delta.  Comfortable seats, even in Basic...movies and sports to watch...great snacks for free:)"
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Traveling Home From Texas,"Returned home after a business trip to Texas. Flew from Dallas to Minneapolis and then onto my final destination of Winnipeg. First flight was full and therefore very cramped(Boeing 717 aircraft I believe). I'm not a big person, nor were the people next to me and still didn't have enough shoulder or arm space. Had to put my back pack under the seat in front of me as all the overhead bins were full, older aircraft with smaller bins. Because of this I also didn't have enough leg room. Really wish they would stop letting people bring these big roller bag suitcases on the aircraft(especially the ones with less storage space), as they take up so much space and 90% of people don't need anything from them during the flight. $30 to check a bag is not unreasonable and would allow people with backpacks, laptop bags, etc. to actually have appropriate space to keep them during the flight. The second flight was much better, newer more modern aircraft with much more space, even with also being a relatively full flight. Overall a good experience with Delta and I would fly with them in the future."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Headed To Texas For Business,"I traveled on Delta to Texas to attend training for my field of work. Delta is always my airline of choice when I fly to the states, as they have always provided great service in the past and this time was no different. Check in at the Winnipeg airport was quick and easy with the use of their many electronic kiosks and then a quick visit with a Delta agent to get my bag weighed and tagged. I flew from Winnipeg to Minneapolis and then on to my final destination of Dallas, Texas. Both aircraft were clean and modern, staff was friendly as always. Another great experience with Delta."
Date of travel: August 2019,50,One of the best airlines,"I am a cheapskate person, usually taking budget airlines such as scoot, airasia and jetstar. Delta airlines, an American brand, is the best i ever had, and i rode Singapore Airlines, Silkair, British Airways and more.In my opinion, all airlines pale in comparison to Delta. The staffs are accomedating, professional, the aircraft is up to standards and they provide delicious meals with pillow and blankets. Something one must consider when taking a long flight of over 6hours from Singapore to Tokyo.The flight was really pleasant and there was plenty of rest on board.In comparison, i flew scoot from Singapore to Osaka; no ok board entertainment, no usb charge points, no pillows, no blankets. But the price is about 10% lower which wasnt worth it as it was a torturous flight of 6hours.Delta is one airline i would recommend over other airlines."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Pre-Thanksgiving Travel,Slight delay the Monday B4 Thanksgiving due to plane maintenance issue. Not a big deal. Delta extended excellent service to our family's soldier flying home the day B4 Thanksgiving (Atlanta to Minneapolis). Thanks Delta!
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Leah the Flight Leader was Great!!!,"I had an absolutely wonderful flight made very special by Leah, the Flight Leader.  She was incredibly attentive, friendly, and professionally, and ensured wonderful service throughout the flight."
Date of travel: November 2019,20,Sky Club,"To sum up Delta’s regard for their frequent flier/ Sky-Club members: I opted to sit at the gate waiting for my flight in the Philadelphia airport rather than in their Sky Club. The interior looks like a high school cafeteria and is extremely claustrophobic when populated, and the self serve cocktail area is laughable in size and selection. As a point of comparison, we stopped in to see what the similarly sized United Club looked like and it was infinitely better and they even had a bar with servers (it even was fully carpeted as opposed to mostly tile). The desk staff in the Delta Sky Club were accommodating and pleasant, but Delta’s corporate-level Sky-Club program attempts at accommodating their regular travelers is laughable when compared to other clubs. Unfortunately across the continental US there appears to be no signs of policy change or caring of how they present their appreciation toward their most loyal customers."
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Good flight from Atlanta to Cartagena Colombia,"What I liked:1. Good snack and service from Atlanta to Cartagena, Colombia 2. headphones were given for the movie3. Check-in when leaving Cartagena was easy and staff spoke English4. Decent prices for flights What could be improved:  1.	Extremely confusing departure from Toronto. The gate changed and staff were not very helpful2.	Boarding planes – seems to be inefficient3.	Flight from Toronto to Atlanta – the plane is old, there is no monitor for movies and if you sit at the back there is no place to store overhead luggage (taken up by safety equipment)"
Date of travel: November 2019,10,Fly Southwest!! Save your money!!!,I fly first class on Delta I get peanuts!!! I will never!! Never fly Delta again!!!!!! You got my $$ one time I am done!!!!!
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Flew from Montana to Utah then switched to K l M on to Munich,This flight was great . We were not a packed plan and it was comfortable size plan.  I had paid for a upgrade for my long hauls and I did not get it on either flight. Because the plan was not packed it made it more comfortable. Be sure and make sure if you paid for a upgrade that you get it.
Date of travel: January 2019,50,Skilled Airline,"Delta is very reliable and you definitely pay for the provided service.  The check in process was smooth, as long as you follow the luggage weight restrictions.  Having your ID and general flight information helps accelerate the process.  At the gate, they usually have an initial brief few minutes prior to boarding to explain the flight status and expectations.  The seats are previously assigned which allows the customers to move to their seats.  I think an opportunity for the airline is to enhance the cabin filling operation which should flow the customers and fill from back to front.  During the flight, you can certainly experience that flight attendants usually care about their passengers.  Try the biscoff cookies because you will like them.  After the flight, the airline has figured out how to get the luggage from the airplane to the carousel, waiting time is almost none.  Overall, the experience was pleasant and I felt safe.  I would recommend this airline."
Date of travel: November 2019,10,Chaotic Boarding at every location!,"I routinely fly from NY LaGuardia, where the Delta terminal experience is terrible, with  inadequate seating, cramped, and chaotic boarding.  I have recently also flown Delta through Orlando and Ft. Lauderdale.  Ft. Lauderdale is a terrible terminal experience like LGA. While Orlando is a better terminal experience, the boarding process is truly chaotic there.And, by the way, if you are on one of Delta's new A321 aircraft, don't even think of turning around in the restrooms.  Think ""smaller than a phone booth!""Delta is bad in, oh, so many ways."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Delta Did Not Disappoint!  Delta is King Kong of the Air Lines!!,The flight was smooth. We landed in one piece which to me makes for a wonderful flight. The flight attendants were friendly and super helpful. I had a tasty hot coffee so no complaints here.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,More than expexted,"Got a good deal for round trip. Connections made flight longer with layovers. Just had ore time to people watch. The delta app was good for most stuff, needs tweaking for airport locations from on area to another. Overseas flights are inclusive of food, beverage, snacks and other amenities. Flight crews and personnel were all professional and friendly.  Newark airport seriously needs a update. Other airports we were in Boston, Detriot, Paris, Barcelona and Amsterdam are levels ahead."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Premium service ,"Flew from Detroit to Beijing in the A350 premium select class. The price was about three thousand dollars less than Delta one cabin but the service was fantastic. I have flown Delta one several times and while it is the top of the line, this was a very good service. The flight attendants paid close attention to the passengers and their needs. Food and drinks were ample. I strongly recommend it."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Delta 109 October 15,"Very nice flight.  On time departure and arrival.  Sufficient space, particularly for this day and age.  Older B767 but had seatback video screen with options, including a moving map, a feature which I have come to very much enjoy.  Plenty of food, complimentary wine, a snack service in the galley throughout the flight, and attentive flight attendants."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Delta 108 September 25,"Very nice flight.  Sufficient space, particularly for this day and age.  Older B767 but had seatback video screen with options, including a moving map, a feature which I have come to very much enjoy.  Plenty of food, complimentary wine, a snack service in the galley throughout the flight, and attentive flight attendants."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Great special service,"I had requested gluten free meals. As a general rule on most airlines I may get one gf meal on a 10 hour flight and the other food regular. However, I received total gf service two meals, snacks and even the warm cookie snack which I had already gotten ready to say no to a regular cookie. Sure made my flight much more enjoyable."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,no room,I found that there is limited room for me even I reclined the seat.no limit on carry on weight is plus.most other airline limited to 15 lbs. which cant carry anything
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Not as usual,"Astounding but this was a totally differerent experience as I expected.  The flight attendants were not friendly but rather rude.  There were no snacks do to the weather, however, business class recieved them?????  I am not sure if their weather was different than mine??  I was traveling with an elderly person and expected a wheel chair to be available to make it easier between flights but there was none, we would have had to wait which would have cut it really close to get to our conecting flight."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Roundtrip to Manchester NH,One of the more enjoyable flights I have had.  The flight attendants were helpful.  The flight was pleasant and the seating more than adequit.
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Decline,"I can definitely see a decline in Delta airline services! For the price they charge you, the service is simply average. To stay loyal, I need something to be happy about, a more than average service!On our way to DC., they did not provide us with free earphones as it had always been the case! They sold earphones to anybody interested. On my flight back home, though, they provided passengers with free earphones! For cleanliness, I give them a 3, for ease of checking in a five, and for ease of boarding the plane, I give them a two. The flight attendants on my back home flight were amazing, the ones on the DC flight were few, exhausted and at times touchy. The only solid plus is that both flights were on time. Am I going to try a different airline next time? Yes!"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Jam pack plane but good flight,"This was a jam packed flight but a good one the service was good the flight left on time and arrived on time, very much as Delta always does."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,A good flight on time,"A good flight back to LGA, the weather was nasty so we had no service on the flight but the crew made it as smooth as possible."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Very good flight,"The flight left on time very good flight we arrived a bit early, that was very nice. What a surprise when we went to claim our bags they we already in the baggage claim area, fastest I've ever seen."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great flight!,"Everything ran on time. Very efficient boarding. The flight attendants were fabulous! I sat in the comfort plus and it was worth the little extra $. 1st class looked amazing, wish I could have afforded it."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,The flight and Flight Attendants GREAT,"We left on time and arrived a little early. Smooth flight and the service form the flight attendants was very good,they took good care of everybody and came around several times to see if anybody needed anything else."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,GREAT FLIGHT,"The plane was clean, the flight attendants were excellent, the food was good as well as the in-flight entertainment ----all in all a great flight."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Comfortable flight,"It had been a while since i flew Delta, reason being because i always found better fares with other carriers and this particular time i was able to fly free using points from my AMEX. but overall the flight was good and comfortable.I would fly with them again. I will check into their fares from now on but the better fare will always win since i travel a lot"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Amazing Service,"I had the pleasure of flying 7.5 hours with Delta last week. The flight crew was amazing. Besides the normal service of food and beverages, I received a recommendation for a great movie to watch. Thankfully, the seat next to mine was empty which allowed me to room for some of my belongings. The flight attendant even raised the empty seat’s tray to allow me more room when dining. They were pleasant without being intrusive. Great flight!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Gainesville to Hartford via Atlanta,"Awesome flight, Delta never disappoints me.  I particularly liked the new rule allowing portable electronics to be left on the entire time during the flight.  I was able to catch up on some movies I wanted to see and tune everyone else out with my new noise cancelling headphones."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Delta's Professional Service,Delta is always very professional with their service from the time you check your bag till the moment you deplane. Every Delta employee does their part to make your flying experence a plesant one. It's always very meaningful when the pilot greets you after the flight has ended.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Flight Attendants were really nice.,"I hate flying but had no choice. Had a sinus issue which gave me a dry cough I was controlling w/ constant lozenges and presc. Sudafed. Very frustrating in a small space like a plane and it makes others uncomfortable. Even with all that, the dry air got to me soon after I sat down. I covered my face. W/out my having to ask, and FA brought me water and gave me some mints from her pocket. Things went fine the rest of the flight. Other FA's were really accommodating to my 15 yr/old son who couldn't decide which snack - LOL so they gave him the variety just for grins. Just simple little things go a long way. Please and thank you mean a lot to FA's. It was refreshing to be treated more like a passenger in the front of the plane!"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Basic Economy = No Problems,"No problems flying ""basic economy"" again on Delta.  Great value.  Did not get seat assignment until going to the gate after arriving in Atlanta.  Got a window seat in the very back, but I brought ear plugs.  Airplane was an MD 88, which is one of the oldest type of jets still flying in the U.S. for major airlines.  Good boarding, good service, on-time routine flight."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Thanksgiving Trip,"First-time International Premium Select passenger on Delta Airlines.  From start to finish the entire trip was simply amazing.  The welcome amenities are from Tumi, high-end speakers, and a delightful dining experience with premium snacks and custom crafted cocktails.  This international flight was long, but well planned.  I enjoyed the staff and entertainment.  The upgraded services between economy and Premium Select was well worth the world class experience."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"""Great Crew and smooth flight!""","The weather was quite windy in one city to rain in another. Our flight was delayed for over an hour but the crew was nice and updated us throughout the delay what was happening every 15 minutes and gave us directions as to what we could do.Take off and landing was choppy due to weather but all in all, a great flight."
Date of travel: October 2019,20,Most Uncomfortable Flight I've Taken!  KLM: Excellent,"I had the middle seat in Economy and it was the most uncomfortable flight I've every taken on Delta.   I've flown to Europe, South America and Asia and never have experienced such cramped seating.   The head rest for short women is also unacceptable as your neck and back are at such an angle that nothing seems to relieve the discomfort.  The food was also so mediocre that it would have been denied or left uneaten had it not been an 8 hour flight.  KLM was excellent in comparison and I will book my flights on that airline whenever possible."
Date of travel: November 2019,10,Flight delayed on Thanksgiving b/c of unnecessary inspections- even though the pilot clearly stated it was fine.,We missed Thanksgiving with our family because the flight was delayed while grounds crew were late to de-icing was the plane. With the rushed de-icing they slightly tapped the tail of the plane - no dent made and inspection completed by maintenance and pilot saying it was fine. To cover their behinds Delta made us all deplane to do an unnecessary “certified inspection” by another official crew to cover their asses-3 hours since we were first supposed to leave. I understand safety but come on it was already inspected and it’s Thanksgiving with tons of people wanting to see their families. Of course there aren’t any other flights out until the next day. I call customer care for assistance with a refund or reimbursement and of course no one is there because it’s Thanksgiving- must be nice to get family time on the holiday. So basically my husband and I’s first Thanksgiving together as a married couple and also the plans to make a pregnancy announcement to my family when we would have all been together today is ruined. I haven’t seen my family already in 3 months because I’m a travel nurse and don’t have a lot of days off. The first time in awhile I’ve flown Delta and the last. I feel so unsupported by them to have to spend Thanksgiving in a cold airport in Utah. So so sad today.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Went out of their way to make me feel bettter,"I broke my foot while in a conference in San Diego. I seldom flight Delta and have no status at all. Nonetheless, the staff at Delta went out of their way to make my trip easier. The wheelchair was waiting for me when I arrived to the airport, they changed me to a seat in the front in order to minimize my movement and all the flight attendants were attentive and caring while on the flight. They made a difficult situation much easier"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Travelling to Detroit,"A timely service, a shorter flight so not as much by way of cabin service. Still very courteous crew and attentive during a busy holiday season"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Delta 698 Grand Cayman to Atlanta,"What a great experience, compared to the recently flown routes of Cayman Miami and Cayman Dallas, this was easy, simple, on time and great cabin crew with in flight service. You guys just keep this up..."
Date of travel: November 2019,10,Mr,"Wow! Delta flight nearly two hours late. No communication. No clear explanation. Delta started out well on the West Coast, but is now floundering with late and delayed flights."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Flying with Delta is like and Old Friend,We started flying Delta years ago for trips to the Caribbean and Jamaica. Friendly and no shaky landings or take-offs.
Date of travel: November 2019,10,always delay with no conpensation,"always delayed for 2,3 hrs, plans for trip is destroyed because of this, we plan to drive to LA from 6 pm, and arrive before mid night, but now, i may be there at 2 am, it destroy my holiday trip."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"Long Flight, Done Right","Long flights aren't exactly what people look forward to, however, with Delta airlines, you might be in for an unexpected surprise. If you are sitting in the main cabin, and you haven't paid for 1st class or the upgrades, I'll give you a heads-up on what to expect. All passengers are given a small blanket and pillow (I do recommend bringing an additional neck pillow). After everyone is seated, they will pass out eye masks and earbuds just in case you forgot yours Each seatback has a LCD screen that you can listen to music, watch a movie or play games on. Food is also provided during the flight. Either way, whether you sleep or choose entertainment, the flight is made enjoyable with all the extras included. I personally found that the aisle seats have slightly more leg room than the window seats, however, if you are wanting to have a view, go for it. If you pack light, you can put your carry on above you and save what little space under the seat in front of you for extra leg room. Delta makes for an enjoyable flight experience, and I'll definitely be flying with them again. Thank you Delta!"
Date of travel: November 2019,10,"horrible, terrible, overall disgusted",they wouldnt let me switch my flight after my sister changed hers 4 times with not a single dollar in fees paid. im mortified at the inconsistency in policy. either do it or dont. dont tell one person they can switch but not the other when its for the exact same reason. only flying united and southwest til i die.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Delta deserves credit for properly handling delay,"For the second time this year, I had the misfortune of being on a flight that was delayed significantly by mechanical issues. The first time it was a United Airlines flight, the second time, Delta. Although it would be much better if both of the airlines did a better job of preventing such delays by keeping up with maintenance, I was struck by the dramatic difference in the way they handled the inconvenience. United gave us little information on the cause of the delay, and what they did say turned out to be misinformation. They made no attempt to help us make alternate arrangements, resulting in us having to spend the night sleeping on the floor in the airport, with no food or water. Frustration and anger don’t even begin to describe the experience. On the other hand, Delta updated us on the situation every 30 minutes or so, with apologies, and the flight attendants gave us water and snacks, and opened a rear door to get us some fresh air when it became uncomfortably hot in the plane. When we finally arrived at our destination, we found out that Delta had already made arrangements for alternate flights for those who had missed their connection. They had agents available to answer questions, and arranged for people with tight timelines to get through immigration and customs more quickly to ensure that they were able to get on their new flights. They set up a system to quickly move checked luggage to the new flights after customs and seemed genuinely sorry about the inconvenience. Bravo, Delta!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Great with ADA passengers,I'm in a wheelchair but they were amazing with getting me on the plane and in my chair in good time. Also took me to the bathroom very quickly. I was worried about that because i do have a weak bladder. They did awesome.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Wonderful flight from Heathrow to Detroit,"This mid-week flight from Heathrow to Detroit was superb in every way.  The flight crew was attentive. The aircraft was clean.  The pilots kept us informed.   Departed on time and arrived early.  Added to these, and perhaps contributing greatly, the plane was about half empty so no one in economy was forced to sit next to another person.   Thanks Delta for not switching us to a smaller plane.  Space is nice.  Flight on 20 November 2019."
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Poking the Seat in Front of Me,"I found the timing to right on schedule.  The entry into the gates was a little lengthy.  They had WAY many TSA agents and other people milling around.  After the shoe search/x-ray machine you are introduced into a very small area to collect your things and put yourself back in order.The flight was a little late and the pilot said he would try to catch up.  We actually arrived 15 minutes early - so - good in one way and strange in the other because I am not used to a jet rushing.  The seat I had would have been a window seat but there was no window.  I don't need entertainment on a flight but between reflective thought and peeking out of the window of the person in front of my I turned on the monitor screen installed in the back of the seat in front of me.  (Talk about fuel economy - with wires, monitors and other controls those contraptions must add at least a couple of thousand pounds to the aircraft).  The games were mostly for children and required lots of poking at the screen."
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Delta Comfort...No Upgraded Snacks or Premium Beverages,"I am used to flying first class, and I booked an international flight with a layover in Atlanta.  The only option I was given was Delta Comfort for the Domestic portion of my Flight. I know Delta Comfort has some benefits like upgraded snacks, wine, beer and spirits.  This flight only offered non bottled water and a cookie or cheese crackers.  Delta Comfort offered no other options.  I will have to compare my next Delta Comfort Flight.  I hope I get options besides water.  The best part of the flight was the complimentary ear plugs."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,767 Delta One Tired,"With a long 10 hr non-stop flight, flying Delta One seemed the perfect choice. The Delta team worked very hard to provide excellent service both on the ground and in the air!!  The only so so experience was with the aging 767 aircraft.  Age and use are showing with the old girl. Delta One seats do recline completely horizontal but being narrow doesn’t allow one to shift positions. So, there you have it.   Recommend heavy ‘medication’ so the coffin effect will seem ‘perfect’. Hurry Delta with the replacement Airbus please."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great Service on Delta Flight,"Its been awhile since I traveled on Delta and I was quite surprised.  From the check-in to the final arrival everything was great.  I opted in for text updates which were very informative including letting me know when my bag was loaded on board.  I've never seen that before.  On the flight I was offered ""my choice"" of 3 different snacks.  That's was very nice instead of the usual mystery bag thrown to you.  I had a short transfer time in Atlanta and Delta took care of it including making sure my bag got transferred. Overall I was extremely satisfied with my trip."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Visit to Family,Delta flies the only non-stop from Hartford to Minneapolis.  We fly Delta whenever we go to visit our family there.  The flight is always on time.  This time it arrived 15 minutes early.  We have a Delta credit card so one checked bag per person is free.  We also get a free companion ticket each year.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"Quality air service, budget friendly","Delta airlines staff have always been very friendly on this long voyage. Attentive, willing to assist, and efficient. They go above and beyond to ensure even the main cabin passengers feel comfortable and well taken care of."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,It's the little things,The snack is not necessary but still nice to pass time.  The coffee is great.  I'm always cold on a plane.  Best of all is the TV!  To watch a movie or anything that can distract me from flying is incredible.  It makes the slightest turbulence unnoticeable.  The experience is so much more relaxing that way.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Good handling of passengers and luggage,"My wife was upgraded to comfort plus due to her elite status, and the cabin crew fixed it so that I could join her. The handling av carry on luggage is excellent. You leave it in the corridor before entering the plane and get it back by the gate after landing at no extra cost."
Date of travel: November 2019,10,Horrible.,"worst airline ever. delayed hours then put on another flight with the worst seats, wasted time and money. after we booked way in advance with seats chosen. absolute worst, got nothing back in return. any other airline then delta is better."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great fight experience!,"This was a lovely trip! I really enjoyed the in-flight entertainment. I always think I'm going to do something productive on the flight, but the huge selection of movies and podcasts always reel me in. The flight attendants are always courteous, pleasant, and helpful. Thank you for an excellent experience! I ordered coffee and Baileys, and the flight attendant offered me a second cup of coffee for a better ratio. How thoughtful!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Delta Air - My Hometown Airline,"We were able to board in advance as my husband has some walking disabilities.  The flight left on time and got into Atlanta on time.  They were trying out a new type of food service that gave us ""placemats"" and more options for meal service.   Still didn't get the food we wanted because it was gone by the time they got to the back of the plane, but it was a good effort.  Plenty of movie choices.  Non stop, 9 1/2 hour flight was exhausting, especially since my husband was sick on top of everything else.  However, I can't complain about the flight.  The staff was great and Delta always comes through for us.  There was a wheelchair as soon as we got off the plane and we were escorted through customs and baggage claim very quickly.   Thanks Delta!"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,It got me there in one piece,Typical economy squeeze but they had the tiniest bathroom I have ever encountered on an airline. Barely had room to maneuver.
Date of travel: November 2019,20,Drive instead,"5 hour delay due to airplane issues in LA. Gate attendant was honest about what was going on, if not for her they wouldn't even get a 1. There was 5 delays before finally leaving. Had to pay for extra day on my car storage due to the delay, and I got a $100 voucher, a three inch sub  and mini crackers for this nightmare."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,great value,good overall flight. good value for economy. the airline assigned the seats and wee able to accommodate a change for us before we boarded to seat us together
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great flight,"Both flights on time, great service, friendly flight attendants, good video choices.  The employees make you feel like you are a preferred client."
Date of travel: November 2019,20,Poor customer service,"a. Poor facilities at terminal - 3.5 hours transfer time!!b. Rude, terse attitude from male flight attendantc. No inclusive food on 4 hour flight"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,good way to travel,excellent service from terminal to flight and onboard services a bit cramped even although i paid extra for my seats food was very reasonable the staff could not do enough to help you a bit sore for a long haul flight but managable thank you for your politness and service
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Boarding seat changing,Flights to Punta Cana went fine the return was something else. Atlanta we had seats in row 21 when we boarded got new assigment to row 39 when boarding they paid no attention to the area to be boarded and how we got reassigned to row 39 I do not know. The plane was noisy and uncomforable.
Date of travel: November 2019,30,"Typical Delta flight, old equipment and filthy interior.","The boarding process is so slow and only second to the deplaning of passengers.  No smiles like Southwest provides, just employees going through their paces doing a job they do not like."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Still tops,"I'm just read my review from 2016, and I still think Delta is number 1.  I'm fortunate to fly first class these days, which means that for overseas flights I can lie down.  I'm also a Delta million miler so I can remember only one overseas flight that was on another top rated airline.  It didn't compare.  Delta has more former military pilots than any other airline which is a huge benefit.  we'll  be flying to Richmond for Christmas on......Delta!"
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Comfort Plus-save your money,"What Delta calls “comfort plus” - just not worth the money.  Seats have a bit more leg room, food may be slightly better but I’d rather have saved the money.  The trip was as usual otherwise.  No complaints except feeling very ripped off."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Delta Wins...as always,"On time, hassle free. Friendly. The free drinks and snacks are a bonus. Never have any problems with Delta. I am happy to fly them exclusively and being a Skymiles members is definitely beneficial. Miles never expire! And we earn points through their partners, Lyft, Hertz Car Rental just to name a couple. In flight entertainment, WiFi all great benefits."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Efficient and painless travel,My flight from Binghamton to Detroit was on time and uneventful. My flight from Detroit to San Francisco actually left the gate a few minutes early and got to San Francisco about 20 minutes early. The flight was smooth and my seat was almost comfortable. The flight attendants were very nice. Overall a nice trip.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Problem free! Easy flight,"The flight was smooth. Plenty of room. Great movies! Everything as it should be! Delta is my preferred airline. Always on time, smooth flights."
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Leg room was not great,"We were flying from Chicago to Oklahoma City and we had to take a connecting flight through Atlanta.  A bit out of the way.  Our flight from Chicago was fine and we had about a 2 hour layover before we bordered.  The flight from Atlanta to Oklahoma City board about five minutes early and we arrived on time.  There was one bumpy stretch, but mostly it was a good flight.  However, we were on a McDonnell Douglas MD-88 (twin-jet) (MD88) for this second leg and believe me, there is a significant difference between the legroom in an MD88 and an MD90.  The crew was friendly and efficient and we did have beverage & snack service.  Though it was a bit of a walk, the gates were both on the ""B"" concourse."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,"Can you say, early flight","We arrived at O'Hare Airport at about 0430 hrs.  We were already checked-in and we both had TSA pre-check.  We were through the security checkpoint relatively quickly.  The plane was a McDonnell Douglas MD-90 (twin-jet) (MD90).  I'm about 6'1, but there was enough room for my legs.  The crew was quite friendly and efficient.  There was drink and snack service.  We left O'Hare two minutes early and arrived in Atlanta about 23 minutes early.  The flight was very smooth.  It was the first flight that I have flown one-way and we each had a small carry-on bag, so we avoided going through baggage when we arrived.  We had a short layover until our next flight to Oklahoma City.."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,SMOOTH   FLYING,This was an awesome flight!  It was so smooth both taking off and landing. The stewardesses were happy and helpful. Checkin and baggage pickup were also so smooth. I literally thanked the pilot for the great flight. Enjoy Delta.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great airline,"Took two recent trips to MKE, both 1st class on Delta and we enjoyed all four flights. They departed either early or on time and arrived early on each trip. The attendants were courteous and professional. Great flight crews"
Date of travel: November 2019,10,Very disappointed with the attitude of the flight attendant,We always flew in the Delta and we were always pleased until the last flight. Our luggages arrived in a day late. And the attitude we received from the flight attendant was very dismissive and offensive. She ignored us throughout the flight and even scolded us .. One thing I'm sure is that we won't fly in Delta anymore ..
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Great cabibn service!,My wife and I tarveled to Paris for a long awaited adventure.  I booked tickets through Delta Airlines.  The flight to France was provided by partner Air France nad service on that flight was lacking.  I wrote a review about that flight also.The return flight with Delta was hands down the best of the two.  Service was outstanding throughout the 9.5 hour flight.  Food choices were good and plentiful.  The attendeants came by at least once per hour to offer water or other drink options. This is very important to help avoid dehydration on a long flight like this.Boarding was organized and timely.  The flight departed and arrived within minutes of the published times. It was an overall good experience.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Smooth Flight,All airlines are becoming the same with more ways to squeeze more money out of you.How many different can you book a seat and and pay for it.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,On time and as comfortable as you get these days.  Nice that they board retired military first.,"Most airlines give priority boarding to active-duty military, but Delta includes retired military, which is very nice.  After all, many of us retired military types are at least partly disabled and appreciate boarding ahead of the crowd."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,"Good value, good service","Very nice staff, boarding isn't organized all that great!! Duty free purchases came on time. Seating is comfortable for a 6'2"" person as I am!! Purchasing beverages was a breeze and free snakes, purchase food were good!!"
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Pretty nice,"I don't believe I ever flown with Delta. It was very enjoyable. The staff was very cordial and polite. I was nice to have an option of lots of things to watch or even play games. I was a little cramped with the leg room, but I get it, you get what you pay for!"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,"Very accommodating, supportive staff","Seats are getting tighter as are bathrooms but staff, particularly flight crew, are very friendly and accommodating. I had a need to use the restroom while we were being ""deiced"" and told I would have to wait. I simply agreed but a few minutes later the flight attendant returned to me and told me I could use the restroom. What a relief for a senior with IBS. I am vey appreciative of such empathy."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Love the flights to/from ATL-SRQ,"As always, Delta delivers with timely flights, professional and personable staff, and overall courteous service from check-in to deplaning."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Diving trip,Was on our way back from Fiji. Sat in the economy plus seats right next to where the stewardesses sit for takeoff and landing. The crew was very nice very helpful The economy plus seats gave lots of extra leg room which was great
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Reliable But Not Special,"If you expect first class service when you fly first class, you know that the experience is likely going to be good but not worthy of being called first class, at least for these prices.  So if your expectations are low, this will be a pleasant experience.  Boarding is always a cumbersome process with everyone crowding around the gate. But Delta has been better about enforcing its boarding discipline process.  On board, the service is attentive and the food is, well, airline food.  The cabin configuration and sleeper accommodations are ok unless you are tall and/or like to keep your personal items close by as opposed to the overhead. Importantly from a competition perspective, at the moment, there is no other non-stop option from NYC to Venice."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,timely flights with one tight connection but less legroom than expected in delta comfort +,"the flight from SAT to ATL landed early which was good because we had a tight connection and my wife was a little slow due to a surgical procedure on her hand she had a week prior to this flight. But the leg room on this flight, I think it was an MD80 was no better than the regular seating in coach which i found annoying. When we boarded the flight from ATL to FNT the seating room was what i had experienced previously in comfort +. The complimentary adult beverages almost made up for the lack of leg room on the first flght."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,"All flights on time, again!","both flights on time, good service for comfort +. Friendly cabin attendants. My spouse had just had a surgical procedure on her thumb, the staff made every effort to let her board early, get comfortable, additional support for her hand etc."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Delta Airlines - Top Notch,"Delta Airlines has treated me extremely well over the past 8 years.  Over this time, I have traveled domestically and internationally and have seen their level of customer service increase tremendously over the past 5 years.  In fact it is normal to see Flight Attendants who truly enjoy their job and it shows.  Thanks to Delta for their commitment to customer satisfaction."
Date of travel: November 2019,30,"The flight was very good, but I was disappointed that the airline made no effort to seat people together","The flight was good, but their was no effort made to seat my wife and I together even though we booked the flight far in advance together, and my wife is a "" Sky Miles "" member. They had put her in between another married couple that they could have easily seated together."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Spectacular,"Spectacular, direct flight without problems. seats much more comfortable than Latam. I guess the plane was better and newer. Very good food. perfect schedule, until the counter service at the airport"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Delta to Italy,"Delta has always been my ""go to"" airline of choice.  I recently flew to Rome and it was an enjoyable experience from start to finish!  Premium Economy is well worth it if you cannot, or will not, pay for Business Class."
n/a,50,Excellent Airline,"Flew DL16 from DTW to LHR on 11Nov19. Flight was smooth and very comfortable. Bad weather in DTW delayed our departure, but the Captain kept the passengers apprised at every opportunity. It was my birthday, so the captain allowed me to see the cockpit when parked at gate. Would definitely book Delta again"
Date of travel: November 2019,30,The Usual Delta,"While I do acknowledge Delta as being on the forefront of safety and reliability, they, like many airlines are asking for more $$$ and providing less. Cramming someone into any 17inch wide seat with little or no room to move your legs is just unacceptable, regardless of the class of seat. (I'm 6'2"", 190)"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,"Headed to Bogota, Colombia","There’s no substitute for 1st class. I’m not sure it’s worth the extra coin sometimes, but Delta does put their best people, gives you the best service and it’s so damn comfortable! They still feed you and the meals are pretty good too, for airplane food. We were fortunate to get upgraded and I loved the experience!!!"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Good flight good service,Flight was slightly delayed but wait was tolerable. Service by staff was great and journey was smooth. Only complaint is if it true that The delta hit will transfer to Incheon from Narita. This will prolong our flight to Manila to additional 2 hours. Sad. But incheon airport has newer airport and nicer facilities.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Detroit Trip,"Great flight to and from Detroit.  Everyone on this trip seem to provide great customer service.  Got a lot of fun loving hate from one of the flight attendants due to me wearing my Dallas Cowboy gear. Great group of people on every leg of my trip.  Comfort + is the way to go, but it is always good to be upgraded to 1st class. I highly recommend Delta Airline."
Date of travel: November 2019,20,Just NO,"Never good service at the gate, rude and incompetent, did I mention rude? Maybe it’s a Hawaii thing, i lived  in Hawaii and never met such lame attitudes. So not sure. Delta is ok in other areas... flying/ pilots are good. Cabin service is meh.I never choose this airline on purpose.It’s really not consistent either."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,flying delta bk to ny thru atl,"flew home early today. bhm to atl was easy and nice.however, once in atl i tried to get an earlier flight and thanks to gate agent beverly, mission accomplished and bonus an aisle seat!!great flight home and flight crew, especially adrian, lindsay and omar were all first rate."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Excellant Service,An actual menu for dinner and drinks with a cocktail aperitif. Excellant service and attention.Comfortable seats with sufficient legroom.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,My favorite airline,I have traveled through Delta both nationally and internationally.  The planes are on-time and the plane seats are comfortable and the service is excellent.  It is my go-to airline.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Only way to fly,Free inflight movies the whole trip.  Free drinks on overseas leg with decent meals.  One of the stewardess was very helpful giving me updates on connecting flights
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Customer service,"Kent is amazing. He genuinely cares and really help me when I missed a flight with another airlines. He related to me and felt like my needs were important. Thank you so much. Alvaro, Susan, and Linay are wonderfully nice and helpful. These people are a good fit for Delta!!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great Flight,Short flight with great service. The flight was on time and was very smooth. Everyone was friendly with no issues.
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Delta's Loyalty Program benefits are confusing,"The higher the status level, the worst seating I get. Immediately after becoming a Gold Medallion, I was seated next to the toilet on three consecutive flights. I am afraid I will be seated in the toilet once I become Platinum..."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,"Safe, pleasant flights with great staff","Having a row of 2 seats is great when travelling as a pair. The food was decent, entertainment choice was satisfactory but most importantly I felt safe. They warned us a few times it was going to be a windy/turbulent landing and as a nervous flyer I was concerned, but the women were so kind and encouraged me it was going to be fine. the pilot eventually landed through fog so smoothly I didn't realise we were near the ground! One of the best flights I've been on, thank you."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Wonderful,"A very comfortable flight in spite of a long journey. I had one stopover each flight was of ten hours. Even in economy class the seats are comfortable, the inflight staff was friendly and helpful. Food was fresh. Flights were on time. The only issue I had was that they didn’t have a good collection of films so I opted to reading my book. Overall it was a pleasant experience."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Safe a d smooth flight,The flight and flight crew were great! The flight crew enjoyed their job and it was apparent on how they communicated with the travels.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Best flight to Liberia,Delta has one of the best and consistent flights going to Costa Rica from Atlanta of all the airlines. It has you on the ground by 1:00 and enjoying the beach and hour later. The same plane then flys out by 2:30 which gives you plenty of time to get to the airport in the morning without rushing.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Amweican v Delta,"Travelled American from AGS to STL and flew Delta on the return. No comparison Delta was far superior. The aircraft was clean, the gate and cabin crew were well groomed and polite. The flights were on time."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Good as it gets....,"Recently flew Delta for a 5 day vacation in New York. We flew out Economy Plus and was very surprised by the quality of the food and service from the cabin crew. Cocktails after take off with hot towels thereafter served a really tasty hot meal with wine. We were offered a selection of wine and spirits during the flight and there was a little snack bar where you could help yourself. Our return flight to Edinburgh was in business class and was excellent. Only a small cabin of 16 seats made it feel quite intimate. Attentive cabin crew, very substantial dinner and breakfast with a great selection of drinks. A fully flat bed definitely makes a difference on a night flight. Wish British Airways would take note of the Delta standard of service. There business class bares no comparison. Would definitely fly Delta on this route again."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Excellent,"Our first trip overseas.  I splurged and got first class.  The only way to go.  Top notch service combined with a comfortable, private seating area where the seat actually lays down.  In flight entertainment was great, and I opted for the global internet pass.  Everything was great and made the 7 hour flight very enjoyable."
Date of travel: November 2019,20,Delayed yet again.,I have been utterly screwed by every airline operating out of Eugene except for Alaska Airlines.  Everything else gets delayed last minute for anywhere from 30 minutes to 10 hours.  Missed a connecting flight today because of a delay and now have to wait FIVE MORE HOURS.  This has happened before.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Delta Nonstop to Detroit,Delta has an excellent nonstop flight from Jacksonville to Detroit. The flight is a pleasant 2-hour flight. The best part of the flight is no stop in Atlanta.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Best trip we have ever had with Delta,"Best attendants we have ever had on Delta, friendly, helpful, concerned.  The seats were decent and the bathrooms were not trashed."
Date of travel: August 2019,30,Delta Flight Atlanta - Manchester NH 11/2019,"flight was full and left on time, was an old updated Douglas MD-80, had not such a good feeling, flight was ok and pleasant, crew was helpful and provided good service, was already late in the evening, the leaving of the plane took a long time, since people had to remove their carry on suit cases from the overhead compartmentsd. Airlines should bann the carry ons to make the disembarking 3-4 times faster, was in row 30, took more than 20 minutes to deplane"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Delta Flight Mexico City - Atlanta 11/2019,"was a very pleasant flight, got an isle seat upgrade for 19,99 $. crew was very funny and supplied a great service, enjoyed the flight very much, had free headset and inflight entertainment on the Boeing 737-800, was a really enjoyable flight"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Excellent direct flight,"Delta was on time, staff was polite and the plane was comfortable. I also used the Delta lounge at RDU and it’s perfect: clean, comfortable and good selections. I was happy lounge was opened early for this flight which departs at 6:15 and arrives in LA at 9:17 so that you have the full day there to get started on business."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"Nice flight, upgraded service","Apparently Delta has recently upgraded service in the Main Cabin on its transatlantic flights, and I was pleasantly surprised by the changes.  Immediately after take-off we were served Bellini cocktails and handed hot towels to refresh ourselves before dinner.  The dinner was the usual pre-packaged/re-heated meal served on an airplane, but was perfectly palatable.  Later in the flight we were offered a warm chocolate chip cookie, then about an hour before landing we got another hot towel service before being served a light meal. In my Comfort Plus seat (only about a $300 upgrade and worth it), I had more than enough room to stretch my legs and be fairly comfortable for the nearly 10 hour flight.  The flight was on time, smooth as silk, as comfortable as possible to be in the Main Cabin, with decent food, and good service.  No complaints at all, the flight was very pleasant in every way."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Good flight...good crew...only one hiccup...,"Had a little trouble with my other airline, so I flew Delta...my second choice. They are now first choice because I'm still sore about a flight/trip experience with the other company.  Anyways...boarded quickly, friendly crew...going smooth. Smooth flight, pretty much all good. The male attendant seemed angry and inconvenienced with us. Don't get me wrong...he was attentive, but he seemed mad at our whole seating area. He didn't hurt my ""feelings""...nothing like that...I just wanted to ask him what the h×<> is your problem, because he made us feel like we were bothering him. Maybe he had a bad day...you never know what people are going through...but he had me slightly PO'ed by the time I got off the plane. NOT a big deal...but just enough to not earn a five that day...that's all.  BY THE SAME TOKEN...we got into rough air right at the end of beverage service and him and the other attendant busted their butts to get to us all...they were an awesome team. I'd rate it a 4.5 or a 4.4 if I could."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Delta Airlines Bigness is in its People's Hearts,"Flying domestically in the US seldom provides much other choice than Delta. Yet it is NEVER regretful to Fly Delta.Ground crew are pleasant and friendly. This alone is enough to make an impression for a traveler. Yet each flight ends with an email from the CEO asking How the Flight Can Always Be Better. Way-to-Go, Delta. You're showing the way how to reach far, big & wide."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Veteran’s Day weekend to Charleston,Our flight to Charleston went as plan. The staff was friendly and attentive on both “legs” of the journey to Charleston.  The flights left on time and both arrived early(Atlanta and Charleston).  On our way back we flew standby because there was snow coming into Cincinnati.  We had reservations for later in the day when snow was supposed to already be on the ground.  We were fortunate and able to get the first flight out on 11/11/19 from Charleston.  Then when we arrived in Atlanta we were on the standby list as well.  We were able to get onto the next flight out in Atlanta as well.  Everyone was very helpful with this process.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Delta is always my preferred airline of choice.,"Delta is my #1 choice of all airlines. I love being able to book my flights on the app, select my own seat, and check in and get my boarding pass. Their app is easy to use. Delta service is wonderful. Flight attendants are happy and helpful. Pilots are informative. Seats are comfortable."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Another Good Flight,"A good flight.On time for the most part, no problems. Friendly  people. Need more leg room, even for shorter people."
Date of travel: October 2019,20,Cheap Tickets,I decided to purchase a round trip cheap ticket down to ATL from LGA.  Each flight was jammed pack and the boarding process was LONG.  So I never knew that there was a boarding class Main Cabin 3; which is last to board.  Imagine boarding last and attempting to get to your window seat. Boarding back to front window to aisle would make better use of time and convenience.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,No issues - went very smoothly!,"From start to finish, the round trip with Delta went very smoothly. I received alerts on my phone and reminders to check in. The process was very easy, no hassles. We were assigned seats at the gate due to the type of ticket we purchased but for the savings, I didn't mind. We were able to sit together even on a full flight. The agents were very friendly as were the flight attendants. We missed out on the beverage service on one leg but the flight was very short and simply ran out of time. Pleasant trip!"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,"Flight from La Crosse to Maui, stops in Vegas and LAX","Delta continues to be a great airline. People are always professional and helpful. We traveled with two octogenarians, one needed wheel chair service. Thanks to the great Delta employees for their help. Only a couple of glitches on our trip. Flight from Las Vegas to Seattle got cancelled resulting in a very long travel day to Maui."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,On time and safe,Everything was smooth from start to finish. There were no issues. The attendants seemed nice. I didn't have a need to specifically call on them for a reason
n/a,50,Chantela,"Chantela was the flight attendant for my Delta flight  (#DL5270). She was so friendly and fun. She actually made the safety directions fun with her mannerisms. She knew I hurt my back and wasn't feeling so well. She bought me blankets, pop, snacks, non aspirin, hand wipes, AND kept checking in on ne. I can tell that she loves people and loves what she does. I left an envelope on my flight full of receipts. I'm hoping the crew finds and contacts me."
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Good Experience,"The flight and crew members were great! My only complaint would be that when they hand out snacks there's either 1 or none gluten-free options. The only options available are for purchase. Other than not having many options, the flight and experience were great!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Excellent experience in my trip to Italy,"It was excellent experience. Easy check in, on time departures and excellent services onboard !!! I recommend this Airline."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Nice and efficient,Staff courteous flight very smooth pilot did excellent job with time management arrived early both going and coming back
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Excellent,A very nice flight. The solo flight attendant did a wonderful job and she had a nice personality. Our flight was on time and it was pleasant.
Date of travel: July 2019,30,Not a choice I will make in the future,"This was the worse flight I have been on. Flight attendants were rarely seen. Other travelers were very rude, noisy and rarely seated but were not corrected even though the fasten seatbelt lights were on. Food not very good and entertainment movies were old."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Another great flight,Great service.  Quick flight.  We were ahead of schedule.  Non stop.  What else could you ask for.  Reasonable price.  Very courteous.   Good snacks. Thanks Delta for always getting me a perfect flight.
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Expected more,"My total flight time in First class was around 3h over 2 domestic flights, and I was not fully satisfied after I disembarked.Granted, the seats were quite wide and comfortable. However, I was unable to recline my seat one of the flights so I was rather uncomfortable.The screens are big and HD and I was pleasantly surprised when I saw the selection of TV series, which included some award-winning HBO-exclusive ones like Game of Thrones and Chernobyl.The staff are quite ""chill"" but sometimes they talk loudly among themselves, which is quite annoying. As for the meal service, some of my dishes were served cold and on one flight, the ""meal"" was simply a choice of tidbits, which was quite dismaying as we paid extra for the meal.My biggest gripe is the boarding. While I was in First class and got to board first, it took around 30min to fill the rest of the jet, indicating a rather inefficient boarding system. On another note, 2 of my suitcases were returned to me damaged (one of them was missing a wheel, the other had a broken zipper tag). I wish the baggage handlers could take more care. Finally, despite having the Sky Priority tag on our luggage, we still had to wait for around 20min or more to collect our bags, while others without the Sky Priority tag were able to collect their bags much earlier.Overall, I expected more from the airline and I am not very satisfied with their service."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Vacation 2019,"After flying the no frills airlines of Frontier for the first and last time, I flew home by way of Delta through ATL.  I have always loved Delta, and except for the lack of seat space like every other airline, the service was great.  This airline still knows how to provide excellence in service while in flight.  ."
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Late flight 6 hour  very long day,"flight was to leave at 7:15am finally took off at 2 pm We were notified at 6:45 whenwe were scheduled to board that needed a part  got there at 11:00  we were boarded at 12:00 but part failed  we sat on board just over an hour while they tried to fix it We were told to get off plane and whenwe got off all the seats were full for the next scheduled flight for Detroit They finally got the part to work and we boarded at 2pm  got in Detroit after 5:30 and finally made it home at 7pm  very longday  Delta did compensate us with 20,000 miles after calling"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,"Good airline, but review has a warning for transatlantic trips on the Airbus 330-200!",I fly Delta regularly. It's a fine airline. But this flight was not a good one. The Airbus 330-200 seems too small a plane for such a long haul. Nearly 10 hours cramped up in such a tight space. But the worst thing was the bathrooms. I've seen/experienced better in inner city bus stations. Really bad. Are there not enough restrooms on these planes for the number of passengers or was I just flying with a bunch of slobs? I won't take a transatlantic flight on one of this aircraft again.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Delta 1 aka First Class,"Delta has become a home in the air, simply superb service, the meals most always excellent. After spending time in some of the more rustic parts of the world and perhaps flying on some iffy airplanes boarding that Delta flight home is can be sigh of relief. Having sleeper seats on the 15 hours of total flight time is well worth the extra cost."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Fly Delta,"Delta is famous for on time performance and reliability. That's the main reason to fly Delta,In flight entertainment is good and the staff is courteous and friendly."
Date of travel: November 2019,10,Traveling With My Family,"The airline lost my kid's car seat.  When we reported it to the gate they gave us a reference number and told us to call back later, expecting us to drive our kid out without a carseat.  Then when we called the number they gave us the next day it tells us there is no way to tell to a representative and to use its automated system.  WORTHLESS.  Absolutely shameful customer service.  We pay a lot to travel and have them check our bag8and they lose it and don't care.  Unacceptable."
Date of travel: June 2019,40,nice,"it is not the first time i fly with Delta. every time i enjoy the trip, the taem are very nice, smily people. i believe i will do it again"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Flight was on time. Flight attendants and crew were outstanding,"I always love getting a flight that is on time. The only downfall on both flights was being made to check my bag. Had small carry on that would have fit under the seat, but they made everyone check their bags. The first time when I checked it at the gate, I got it with the tag off. Small inconvenience, but tolerable"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Delta One,Flying to Europe is never fun. This time we choose to fly Delta One. What excellent service they provided. The food to drink service was awesome. From the time you board the plane until leaving the flight attendants are so attentive. But of course the best part was lying flat to sleep the night away.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Pleasantly surprised,I was very happy with my flying experience with Delta airlines from the beginning of my trip to reaching my destination
Date of travel: May 2019,50,Worth it for a trans-Atlantic flight,"Flew Delta One. Security, check-in, boarding, and clearing customs in Germany were smooth with Delta's Sky Priority. Delta Lounge experience was a relaxing way to start the journey. On-board food and drink were very good compared to other flights. Dedicated business class staff were professional and attentive. I tried to sleep as much as possible outside of food service times, so I did not make much use of the in-flight entertainment. Seat was comfortable and had plenty of storage."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,flying delta to birmingham,"flew to bham yday. 2412 to atl. easy flight.at atl the gate agent, sherronda was awesome!! i was in 30a, she put me in 24bthe middle-yuck.next thing i knew the screnn showed me in 15c-the aisle, yippee!!she was the best!!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"As a Diamond level frequent flyer, I am spoiled","Upgraded to first at least 45 mins prior to flight.  Was waiting in Concourse B SkyClub.  Had guaranteed Comfort+ seat in row immediately behind first which would have been acceptable, but first is best. :-)On time departure and arrival.  First trip into MLB and was pleasantly surprised by the airport facilities.  Very nice and easy to pick up luggage and get rental car right outside."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Comfort+ = Perfection,"I flew in Comfort+ for the first time and I absolutely loved it! I had not flown Delta in a very long time and I was very impressed with not only the plane, but with the flight attendants as well! Everyone was very nice and accommodating."
Date of travel: November 2019,30,In the shadow of KLM and AirFrance.,"Delta, KLM and Air France are in the same SKY TEAM group. Out of those three airlines I am placing Delta as the last one. On the flight from MIami to Minneapolis (almost 4 hours flight) we had to pay for a head phones to enjoy in-flight entertainment and had to pay for any alcohol beverages. On intercontinentat flight from Minneapolis to Amsterdam, served by quite old plane service was far way from that one which we had on the way from Europe to US (KLM). Eventhow the plane was not full there was not enough menus for all passengers. Food? Bread roll almmost frozen, chicken very poor and tasteless, service staff in rush almost pushing to collecting the trays. One and only good thing it was landing before schedule. Next time we will try to choose other airline."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Indianapolis to belize,"Great flights, accommodating service, took entire family this year and upon request they made sure we could all sit together which helped calm the nerves of our children who had never flown before"
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Not great,"I flew  I Delta from MSP to San Jose CA.  The plane was full.  The staff were courteous, efficient, and professional. I was unhappy with a few things. The plane was very loud. Painfully loud. I struggled to hear the guy next to me and the movie.  My movie monitor wasn’t calibrated right and it was frustrating to find a movie to watch. The movie selection was reasonable... just hard to hear without putting earphone volume up high. Check in went pretty well except there was a backup that took  pretty long for some, including me. I will take Delta again if they have the best price."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,17 hrs was not too painful...,"An older 777-200ER plane like the one we flew to JNB from ATL, but this one had been re-furbished to add leg/foot support in our seats (24F, 24G).  This more comfortable seat made the trip home much more pleasant than going to Africa, even though the flight was ~1hr longer due to prevailing winds.  I normally rate Delta ""excellent"", at least on all their domestic flights.  Not quite as good on the long-haul flights...."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,"Delta comfort down, First Class Back!","For being a coast to coast flight with 3 stops, it was not that bad. Upgrading to comfort on Delta was totally worth it. I used miles to upgrade so nothing out of pocket on either departure or return. Flight attendants on the flight to Long beach were fantastic. No pushy attitudes, just doing their jobs with patience and smiles.The way back however was a different story. I would have given 5 rating had the first leg in First Class been better without snobby attendants. You would think that after people still pay lots of money to be catered to, they flight attendants would have better grace and poise. Not mine. Total grump-face the whole time, whacked my elbows on the way up and down the aisle (plenty of room to tuck in too). Snubbed me for drinks a few times until I made my obvious annoyance known. Second and third legs of the trip were fantastic. Had leg room, plenty of videos, drinks, and good chats with the attendants on both sections. I don't know what happened on the first leg but it did not make me feel like the lack of service was warranted, or maybe she should have just called in sick that day."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Great experience EXCEPT FROM ALT TO PHILLY,"Delta was great flying comfort class EXCEPT from Atlanta to Philadelphia. The plane i think was from WW2 and the crew showed no motivation or really poor customer service.  I paid for extra comfort but was not there. No monitor to view movies and no movie at all on flight. Crew had to do safety briefing the old way, and you could see they really did not care.  Contact Delta customer service but have still YET to hear back from them over me spending money to upgrade our flight, but was truly disappointed"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,A Fine Way to Fly,"We had to change planes in Seattle.  Our flights went smoothly, and the seats and service were fine.  Check-in was orderly.  We only brought carry-on luggage.  Opportunity was given to check luggage for free, but we preferred to keep ours with us.  The overhead storage got a bit crowded but the flight attendants helped arrange it.  Even though my adult son is fairly large (5'10"" and 260 lbs) he didn't complain about feeling crowded.  His seat was next to the aisle which helped.  All but one flight had TV screens with quite a few choices of movies and other things to watch on the back of the seat in front of us."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Splurged on Delta Comfort,"At 78 and 84 legroom is important to us.......and long flights make it even more necessary.SO we flew DELTA COMFORT DEN to ATL....then ATL to JNB on Sept.9,2019 and back on Oct.8, 2019.  i do not know if dDelta Comfort is premium economy.Obviously, the flights were MORE expensive than economy.While we did get the legroom.................the seats themselves were NOT comfortable.  never felt this way on a flight before....and don't know why.On the way home, with a few empty seats in economy.......I tried those.  Had great legroom...Delta Comfort probably wasn't necessary!!!!i will say that the attendants were fab.......the food OK......and the restrooms cleaned periodically.  That was wonderful!YES.....I would fly Delta again......but Delta Comfort?  Just don't know."
Date of travel: October 2019,10,First Class or Worst Class?,"We decided to use many, many thousands of miles for a first class trip across the USA. we flew a 737-800 on the non-stop flight.  I had been fortunate to have flown Business Class in past years with several carriers including Delta.  I am sorry to say that the seats on this flight were nowhere near those flights and didn't even measure up to Premium Economy.  I have provided photos of the seating arrangements that attest to the miserable conditions and the total waste of Delta Sky Miles.  You can decide for yourself.  For me, I will say goodbye to my 21 years in the AMEX Sky Miles program and give my remaining 7,000 miles to charity and vow never to waste my $$$ on Delta again."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Flight Attendants Very Good,"I used to fly Delta all the time during my working days then stopped when they drastically reduced their perks.  I used them recently on my RT from Atlanta to Phoenix.One big improvement I have noticed is their flight attendants are much better.  Very attentive and friendly.  Also they were on time for both flights.  Only negative is the quality of food and wine in business class.  A ""good ole"" hamburger....ugh.The good old days are over but it is what it is.  All airlines do it.  Squeezing the dollar at the expense of the customer.   Sure am glad that I retired and travel less."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Our first time flying first class,"When my husband said that he booked our first first-class flight I asked why he would spend the extra money. Let me tell you we flew first class. Just after we got seated we were offered a drink and we weren't even in the air. Plenty of legroom and the service and food were wonderful. Given the chance, we will fly with Delta again and first class all the way."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,An eye opener,"My Virgin flight was cancelled but they arranged a seat on a substitute Delta flight leaving and arriving at the original scheduled times. What an eye opener! The check in staff were so pleasant and efficient it only took seconds. The flight attendants were welcoming and super in all their efforts. The plane was clean and the flight comfortable. Having been disillusioned with our own flag carriers, who have lost the plot, I shall certainly choose Delta the next time I visit the USA. Thanks Delta."
Date of travel: November 2019,30,On time but food needs to be “First class”,"Flew 3 sectors on delta /delta connection 1st sector 757/200 Tampa /Atlanta  food was pathetic for 1st class nuts and nibbles2nd Atlanta/salt lake city 757/300 served lunch which you only had 2 choices/ no menus in first class just told what you could have ?????? Very poor for 1st class3 sector EBR175 ,was just nuts and nibbles and No TV in first class ( this was a delta connection plane) when you pay triple the price for up front then you expect a very high standard,even premium economy on Singapore airlines is better value /service and food"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Fine,"Delta Airline did not give us seat assignments originally but assigned us seats soon enough. The attendant at the terminal moved us at her own liberty off to some other seats after being assigned seats and having given us the boarding passes. That was not a request from us so i do not appreciate it. The in-flight service is excellent. The entertainment is excellent. The leg room is great. The flights are upgraded, beautifully done and clean."
Date of travel: November 2019,10,Delta Baggage check,Upon arriving to gate early and waiting 45 min to board an on time flight crew kept announcing for passengers to check bags if possible. I didn't have extra baggage or a coat as I was carrying on an acceptably sized bag.  I did not want to check my bag as timely medication and basically my on board luxuries were in carry on. I was told by gate staff to check with on board flight attendant to see if it was possible but they recommended I started unpacking what was needed and check it. Before I could speak to a flight attendant baggage crew threatened that I've already missed the opportunity for my bag to make this flight due to my lack of cooperation. This was not true but added anxiety to my trip for which my medication was given to me for help.  As I checked my bag and entered plane I noticed several spaces where my could have been placed including the empty spot above my seat.  I can't stress enough how upset the scenario made me and how it created a terrible fight between my husband and me. I will not fly Delta again.  They didn't treat me as a person or a person with sensitive issues.  I would be afraid to ever trust them again. Needless to say they checked my bag as I didn't have a choice and it did makeNewark.  Not that it made it any better but I was right to be mistrustful as upon picking it from the carousel Newark staff never checked my tag. No one questioned if it was my bag.  I was able to leave the airport with my bag and no verification it was my bag.  Horrible to think what would have happened had my medicine been taken by another person.  I'm a person and wish to be treated fairly which Delta could not do.  I was just a boarding pass to them and my feelings did not matter.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Small and Cramped but you can survive,"It is a very cramped flight.  No room for any carry ons.  Very tight.  Flight is about an hour.  Just hunker down and meditate, it will be over before you know it.  go to the bathroom before you board"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,I was very pleased with Delta,"I haven't flown Delta in a long time and I was very pleased on this flight.1.  The plane looked new, clean and in great shape.2.  The electronic features worked perfectly3. Free snacks were fine4.  The flight attendants were the most professional looking and acting attendants I have seen in many years.   5.My seat was comfortable.6.  They did not lose my luggage."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Flight,The entire round trip on Delta Airlines went very smooth with no problems whatsoever. The service throughout from their employees was excellent.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great flight experience,The Comfort plus class on this plane is right after coach and has slightly extra leg room and a little bit more pampering.The extra space made it more comfortable. Built in video screens with a nice movie selection was in every seat. Bathrooms are larger and more comfortable than domestic flights. All food items served tasted great and fresh. Fresh warm cookies were served as well. Staff were wonderful too. Seat and bathroom were clean. Check in was quick and smooth. Will certainly pick delta again for international flights
Date of travel: November 2019,50,CLE to SLC to PHX,"Delta was on time and while there was a 43 minute layover, which concerned me, it was no problem to catch the connecting flight.  All flights left on time and arrived on time.  Great service and seats were decently comfortable."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,I prefer flying on Delta,This was a vacation trip to Disney World.  Unfortunately Delta no longer has flights from LEX to CVG which now  makes traveling on Delta a little inconvenient.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,smooth flight to punta cana,"stress free flight as i had pleasure to visit delta sky lounge rather when wait by gate, delta was on time and beyond professional and would do this flight again."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Uneventful flights,"My wife and I always try to fly with Delta due to two things. Number 1, we have Delta Amex cards that allow us to fly with a discount cost due to the miles we have built up, plus we get one piece of luggage checked for free. And number 2, but more importantly, we always have a pleasant experience flying with Delta. The flights leave on time, the people who work for the airline are friendly, and the airline never has a issue with our luggage being misplaced or damaged!As we fly in the future, we will always choose Delta over the others airlines."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great service,"Delta has really upper their game in the past years. Flight attendants are always courteous and friendly, aircraft entertainment systems are a really nice touch with plenty to choose from and the boarding process has been streamlined."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,FIRST CLASS IN ECONOMY,"I've flown long haul flights before and they were no fun. they gave you a cookie and turned out the lights and said go to sleep.  Delta has raised the bar big time.  the word of the day is SERVICE.  they start with hot towels, ear jacks and a sleep mask.  After that is food, food and more food.  I've never had such good service. My wife and I enjoyed the entertainment system on the back of the seat.  The movies were up to date. I did not sleep too much, but it was deep enough to relax. this allowed us to enjoy our first day in Athens without wasting it by sleeping at the hotel."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Flight ti USA to catch cruise,Most surprised to see that the flight attendants were not young. This did not inhibit their great service and friendliness. Apart from the long flight this flight was acceptable. Wheelchair assistance at both Los Angeles and San Francisco was a godsend.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Fly Delta - Great Service - On time,Great service - Flight was ahead of time - Crew was prompt and friendly - I had an early flight and the crew spot on - Very polite- Uniforms were clean and crew looked presentable
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Tiny TV screens with videos that don’t play and a busted armrest.,We were taking a special birthday trip to New York City for the weekend and wanted to make it special and use our miles to fly first class to Newark. They use old planes to fly back-and-forth between Atlanta and New York and Boston. There was no tray table in my armrest it looked like someone had pulled it off bending the support piece so that they armrest would not close. The stewardess asked me where I planned  to eat my meal. I said I suppose I will eat it in my lap like a picnic since I have no tray. She said that’s weird but OK. Let’s just say it is not worth using your points to go first class!!! I should’ve known and stayed in the back where I belong. If you’re flying to New York or Boston save your money save your points and buy a nice snack at the airport and maybe even a drink to take on with you. Have a party in the back of the bus.
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Three Cheers For the Flight Attendants,"I had a bad experience flying Delta 15 years ago so I was hesitant about flying again. Booking this trip was a last minute decision (3 weeks before travel) so I didn't get an optimal price. However, there is only one stop on the way to Calgary, Alberta, Canada from Albuquerque, and it's in Salt Lake City. My only concern were the small seats with barely enough leg room. My knees were in the back of the seat ahead of me, so I had to be careful and not move (else the person in that seat would get my knees in their back).The layover time was great on the way and I stressed a bit with a shorter time returning home but the gate was close by. The attendants at the gate and on the plane were very friendly and helpful. They honored my request when I asked not to be disturbed because I needed to sleep on both flights. I love the uniform colors!"
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Business Trip,Flight was just ok.  Attendant was very unfriendly and somewhat rude when it came to luggage.  Did not like the fact I was singled out to have my carry-on (which was in compliance with the requirement size and I only had 1 carry on and my purse) moved to the cargo area when other people were allowed to bring two pieces of carry on that were much larger than mine.  My carry on would have very easily fit under a seat.  If I am supposed to be allowed to bring a carry-on I want it with me.  I had a computer in my carry-on that could have been damaged and there was no consideration given to that.  If you say you are allowed 1 carry on and 1 purse then let me bring it on the plan and make others who have two carry ons and larger luggage put their luggage in cargo and don't take away the one piece of luggage a person is allowed.  Bad compliance issues when dealing with carry-on's.  My seat was also very uncomfortable.  I felt like I was a board because I had to sit straight up with no give in the seat.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Flight from Atlanta to Venice,Delta flight from Atlanta to Paris was fine. 2 meals!! Note that the international terminal in Atlanta is NOT connected to the domestic terminals. You can get from one to the other via airport bus (free). We arrived in Paris and actually went through customs (quickly) there. We did not need to claim luggage there. Our flight to Venice was on Air Italia which code shares with Delta. We got our luggage in Venice and walked right out (no security checks) of the terminal.If you have alot of baggage I highly recommmend getting a private water taxi into town especially if the taxi can take you directly to your hotel. More expensive than the Vaporetto but quicker and more convenient in that you will not need to drag your bags up and down the bridges which have no ramps (steps only).
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Arrived early,Excellent flight. Left on time and arrived early. LGA has a ton of construction but does a nice job of commercial traffic management.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Great flights,"Never having travelled so far before, I was a bit worried but the flight was great.Comfortable seats with ample leg room, pleasant staff, plenty drinks, snacks and meals as well as a good variety to watch on TV.I wouldn't hesitate to fly Delta Airlines again 😁"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Surprised and Pleased,Our original carrier had cancelled our flight. We booked our new flight with Delta. Part of the trip was in comfort+ and part was in economy. The service and cleanliness was top notch. Love that you get a text letting you know where your luggage is.The staff was courteous and lovely.My only complaint is that in economy there is no leg room which makes it rather uncomfortable for a long flight. There was no comfort + available.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Love delta,"I’ve flown a couple different airlines but from now on will only choose delta. Great flight, great attendants, great in air amenities if your flight is longer than an hour. We weren’t delayed and easy check in which is the best you can expect flying. Baggage fees are always going to be apart of flying so I wasn’t worried about that. However, I had a carry on bag with rollers. They needed people to check them so I volunteered and for free baggage and hassle free boarding and off boarding."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Back to the Philippines,"Awesome flight... Again! This was my second trip to the Philippines and just like the first trip, Delta made the process easy and comfortable. The only incident I encountered was that my name was ""truncated"" on my ticket due to the number of characters allowed in the system, so I was informed on my first trip. What could have been a bigger problem was resolved by the Delta staff to ensure I did not miss my flight. Always make sure that your ticket matches your passport name, letter for letter or you will encounter problems upon arrival at another country..."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Never a Bad Experience,"I was not happy with the layover time between flights, but at least I got there. Friendly staff. In flight movies. Decent legroom. Free coffee, water, juice and snack. Everyone was helpful in getting from one flight to another."
Date of travel: November 2019,10,Did not help when the flight was delayed.,"When the flight was delayed due to Air Traffic Control, the gate agents in Salt Lake City (SLC) where I had a connection to KC (MCI) were extremely rude and belittling. They shifted all blame to ATC, but did so in a careless manner. Even though they can legally blame ATC, without giving hotel and meal vouchers to customers, they could have been at least somewhat kind about it."
Date of travel: June 2019,50,1st time using First Class,"Never felt more special in my entire life! Because of Delta, I can never NOT fly first class, again! True Story..-Delta Skycap: this service, ALONE, made me want to fly 1st class. I got to forego the 30+ minute long line full of agitated flyers and cranky children, and got to use Delta Skycap. They were friendly and smiling- not something I'm used to flying on a standard ticket. They may as well have offered free hugs- it wouldn't have suprised me one bit!-The flight: damn- I had an ice-cold bottle of water, a pillow and a neatly-folded blanket waiting for me in my seat (-THERE'S MY HUG!). When the flight attendant took my lunch order- how about this- she crouched down, put her hands on her knees and said (in the sweetest southern accent), ""what can I bring you for lunch, Sweetie? We have____, or ____...and how about a cocktail or some wine, to go with your lunch?"" -talk about raised eyebrows!! She was so genuinely sweet that I thought I was being punked! Forget about the heated nut dish, porcelain plates, glassware and silverware- forget about the ben & jerry's dessert and forget about the private bathroom area- separate from the rest of the plane- what got me was how genuinely friendly the flightcrew, was. I'm a horrible flyer and suffer from anxiety, claustrophobia and ptsd- I always upgrade my seats to keep my triggers in check. But the helpfulness of the Delta Airlines flightcrew made my first class experience was so worth the pricetag! -Will definitely fly with them, again!"
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Last resort airline b/c of price,"I flew from Toronto YYZ to Fort Lauderdale FLL with a stop in ATL.Leaving YYZ was fine, but then my connecting in ATL was late, AND they ran out of overhead space. I was traveling with only a carry-on so that I could leave quickly once I landed, but because of the delay and no overhead space, I was late. I do understand that when flying you should anticipate delays, but there always seems to be a Delay with Delta. It's decent airline in you are strapped for cash. Keeping in mind this is that infamous airline that gave a passenger a bloody nose, even after he had an assigned seat. On 3 of my flights, they didn't have a seat for me until I got to the gate. It made me worried that they may have overbooked seats and might bump me to another flight."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,"Trip to Houston for quilt show, not world series.","Flights were on time, changing planes in Detroit was easy with gates close together. Airline personnel at the gate and on the plane were pleasant and helpful."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,On time,Staff was very courteous and was there to help.  We have never traveled Delta but willin the future.
Date of travel: September 2019,40,LA to Atlanta,This was a good flight!!  The only thing that was dissapointing is that the wi-fi did not work the entire flight and they were having difficulties playing the movies.  It wasn’t a huge deal because the flight was only 4 hours and at night.  If it was day time and a longer flight this would have been a major problem.
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Very smooth flight,"Our flight was on time, boarding was easy. We had checked our bags so all we had was a personal bag. Seats were comfortable, the bathrooms were cleaned a few times during the flight.The meals were sufficient, nothing fancy, but the food and drink service was excellent"
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Delta to Nashville,"A group of six of us purchased airline tickets to go to Nashville for the Veterans Day weekend. The price was very good which helped make our decision to go. The check in process went smooth. We arrived early to make sure we got the seats that we purchased earlier. We’ve heard about airlines over booking seats. Well, when it came time to leave, the plane was delayed. Fortunately it was for only thirty or so minutes. The plane was very small. The over head luggage compartment was also very small so our bags had to be checked in because they would not fit. Delta provided this service free of charge. The flight was smooth. The plane had no inflight entertainment, but that was alright, because the flight was under two and half hours. The return flight was a different story. We followed the same procedure as before. This time however the delay was almost four hours. The plane had trouble leaving New York for some unknown reason. The Delta  price was very good, but delays on both ends would make me look more closely at other Airlines in the future."
Date of travel: November 2019,30,pushing an agenda,"several weather delays, the app was updated pretty well but while waiting at the airport there was not a gate agent until after the flight was supposed to have already taken off and now updates or announcements were made. Delta is also pushing a homosexual agenda in their advertising on plane and in the jetways. I hope they do some reseach to see the medical evidence for the medical and mental damage that homosexuality has on indivduals, children and society. Not to mention the immorral implications. I know we will not all agree, in such cases look at the objective data to inform your decisions."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Good surprise,"First time flying Delta Air Lines. It was very convenient and really a good experience, despite the stop in Atlanta airport, which by the way, is very interesting. The crew offer two types of snacks (savory or sweet),  both very good. We wil flight again with this company..."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,atlanta J fashion,"Have never flown Delta before and my ticket was the least expensive one I could get. Flight did not board on time but they hustled everyone on board and shut those doors super fast. The first thing i noticed when I sat down was the seat felt wider than the United seats I usually get.... are the Delta seats really wider...... or maybe I'm losing weight? naw... seat felt wider than the United planes.... free games and movies on the flight i was on... my 1.5 hours was the BEST FLIGHT ever........the games kept me entertained the entire flight. This is a SMART move to keep people entertained for free as it keeps people from thinking how their carry ons had to be checked and how cramped airplanes really are. Flying sucks. I can give up the bad food and snacks... but the tight seats keep me from flying more. I'm 5'10 and my knees are always touching the seat in from of me... my DELTA flight was short, sweet and entertaining. Not sure if i just got lucky but it was a great flight."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Seattle to Lihue in first,It was a full flight that got out of the gate on time. Greeted  with drink service before leaving the gate. We then sat on the Tar- mac for almost one hour due to dense fog and change in wind direction. Once in the air the flight attendant Samantha took good care of us with great service for drinks and meal. It was a smooth flight and very enjoyable due to the good service.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,On-time for every segment,We had a series of four flights as we travelied to and from Las Vegas. All four flights were on time and event free.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,First time flying to Bermuda,"We were worried about going economy, but it was a short flight and it was enjoyable. Comfortable, clean and the friendly staff made it seem like we were landing in no time. The choice of entertainment also helped the flight go quickly. Great variety."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Great flight,This was an Airbus and the flight could not have been smoother. Probably the nicest ride I have ever had. Of course the economy seats are not the roomiest but it was a non-stop flight and for 3.5 hr it was not bad. Our return flight was also a non-stop on another Airbus and we had the same experience. It was a red eye and I slept most of the 4 hr flight.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,A Step Above American Airlines,"I always fly American because my local airport PGV only has American.  This time there was a $500 difference to fly from RDU vs PGV so we did park and relax and flew out of RDU.  It was cheaper, the service was better, the snacks were better,  the cocktails were comp'd.  The plane was cleaner and the seats were more comfortable.  The staff was friendly and helpful."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Planes seemed like brand new!,"We were really pleased with our Delta flights. We fly delta frequently and are satisfied customers. Flights are on time, planes are very clean. Larger flights have in flight tv, movies, games. Be sure to bring headphones you can plug in for these."
Date of travel: November 2019,20,Delta Customer Service and Flights in General have really gone down.,"Delta's methodology for boarding the plane is poor.  There are literally seven or eight categories for boarding groups.  They have gates set up, but no one uses them.  Instead people bum rush the walk way door and generally block the pathway.  Our outgoing flights had only one Service Agent at the gate which also slowed the boarding process immensely.I used to fly Delta extensively and exclusively and accumulated 100's of thousands of travel miles.  They were great back then when I was in a different career (prior to 2010).  Now, not so much."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Surprisingly excellent,"My wife has been hesitant to fly with Delta due to complaints she has heard of, however we didn't have much of a choice for our recent trip. We flew out of Newark, NJ with a layover in Atlanta before getting to our destination in Cancun. I have to say, we were pleasantly surprised. The planes were roomy and the onboard services were on par with what we love about the other airline we fly. I especially loved the free television/movie access with the complimentary headphones (I usually only bring Apple lightning headphones that I can plug into my phone). The flight attendants were very accommodating and the flight crews did bang-up jobs getting us to our destinations ahead of schedule. Before these flights we would have never even considered Delta, but after this we certainly will not overlook them for any flight needs we may have in the future."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great service,Delta really knows their market. They provide great service even in their short commuter flights. I enjoy the extra seat room and free drinks with comfort class. It’s nice to use the inflight entertainment and the charger ports in the seats
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Do not buy trip cancellation insurance from Expedia [2019],"Cancellation insurance (AIG) doesn't cover you from the cancellation  ... made by the carrier! My flight home has been cancelled. It was the last flight that day. I had to buy a ticket from another carrier in order to be at home that day. Surprisingly, it is not covered by the  insurance."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Excellent Business Class Lounge and Flight Experience,"We recently flew Delta's Business Class from Huntsville, AL, to London, Heathrow.  Our first stop was in Detroit, where we had a 7-hour layover.  We spent that time in the Sky Club Lounge, which was delightful.  Not all Sky Clubs are equal: this one was huge, had a great food selection, and had an open - meaning serve yourself! - bar!  We found comfy seats near interesting passengers and settled in for the day.  Lunch was a smorgasbord of Asian and American dishes.  There was plenty from which to choose.  There were lots of USB charging ports available in the lounge, although we use secure dongles whenever we use those.  Mid-afternoon I went to see what the bar was like.  I was just hoping for a glass of wine.  To my surprise, there were many bottles of wine and all sorts of spirits, all in a self-service bar area!  I discovered a tasy red and enjoyed 2 glasses before we boarded our evening flight across the pond.We had the first 2 center BC seats.  Our lay-flat seats slid into a cubbyhole in front of us.  We had remote seat controls that let us control every imaginable angle of recline and another remote for the IFE screens.  We had pre-ordered our dinner selections, which were pretty good, and I managed to fall asleep after dinner until our approach to LHR.  I missed breakfast because I was sleeping but hubby enjoyed his eggs.The service in BC was impeccable."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,"Excellent service, good seats with legroom to spread out.","This was a long flight, but it was a good one! There were transfers, but the longest flight was very comfortable, with great service."
Date of travel: November 2019,30,What happened to in flight meals?,"Having enjoyed a breakfast on our flight from JFK, I was expecting a lunch and or dinner on the six hour flight to Honolulu.Wrong. A cranky window seat passenger in 15F who refused to turn out his overhead light or shut the window blind all flight added to the frustration of being offered water, coffee and cheesits. The cabin staff were great however some warning before the flight would have helped."
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Not too bad.,"First American Airline experience. Overall not too shabby.Food was a bit of a let down, for dietry food there's no choice, for me it was just a curry, with some other stuff I didn't enjoy. Possibly giving a choice beforehand would work as not everyone will like the one dish chosen for that dietry need. The snacks were also a let down.The seats got uncomfortable after a few hours, my hips ended up hurting. I get that airplane seats aren't the most comfortable thing in the world anyways but I was unable to get comfy for the whole 8 hours.However the ground staff and flight attendants were helpful and very friendly and helpful.Entertainment on board was also good, had a nice selection of movies and tv shows."
n/a,10,One our worst flights ever,"This was a nightmare. Our flight was supposed to leave at 11:53am, it did not leave until after 7:40pm. The delay was do to weather in the morning & a closed runway. I can not blame that on Delta. What I can blame on Delta is delaying the flight time 4 times & changing the departure gate 3 times. The gates were so full of people it was hard to find seats, so changing gates 3 times did not help because each time we had to search for seats. We were so uncomfortable the whole day & arrived at our home after midnight. All we got were sorries for the inconvenience."
n/a,40,Nice flight to Chicago,Our flight out of Atlanta to Chicago O'Hare went off without a hitch. The fly attendants were great. It was a pretty full flight. Left & arrived on time. The seats were okay for cramped airline seats today. No entertainment or place to charge your electronics.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Trip to aruba,Had a good flight. All 4 flights there and back left and arrived on schedule. Airline staff was polite and helpful
Date of travel: November 2019,50,as always,"It is always a pleasure to fly Delta, they take guest service very seriously. The flights, connections and on board assitance is by far the best in any of the airlines I fly."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Delta and Lounge Makes for enjoyable experience,"I take Delta to NYC often and I find it reliable and the enjoy the movies on board. In addition, I have access to the Delta lounges and I thoroughly enjoy that experience."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,First Class Business Trip,"I have never been to Kansas City airport, so I did not know what to expect.  This was a non-stop flight that was less than 2 hours.  Being in First Class, I expected premium snacks and beverages.  The flight was nice, and baggage claim was not too far from the gate.  I would recommend the Delta Airlines  direct flight from DTW to MCI."
n/a,50,Business  and pleasure  trip,Booked round trip lax to hnd and I must say the service  was more than expected. We were unable to check in online or on the app at the airport  the gate agents were very friendly and helpful  with checking in. In flight the crew did an excellent job ensuring we were comfortable and the flight was enjoyable. Overall  first  class service in economy class
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Best Flight attendant ever!,I was flying from Detroit to San Francisco and our flight attendant was very engaging and attentive.  She introduced herself to each passenger and said she wanted to make sure she met each person’s needs.  She was constantly in the aisle checking on passengers and was genuinely friendly and warm.  Best service ever!!
Date of travel: November 2019,50,flown a few times with Delta,"we have flown a few times with delta and have had a great service, meals drinks comfort, check in, we can not fault this airline"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,"Easy, Comfortable, Free Food !!",Airplane was clean and new.  Overhead bins were awfully small. Movie selection was extensive.  Flight was smooth and on time.  FREE MEAL.  Haven't had that for a LONG time in economy.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Long Haul without much pain,"For a nearly 16 hour flight, this Delta flight wasn't too bad!  Sat in the middle aisle and center seats, between the two aisles, which allowed for us to get up and move about the cabin without disturbing another passenger.  Had plenty of food and drink available, plus self serve snacks at the flight attendant's station when ever you wanted them.  Took the reverse flight from JNB to ATL 5 weeks later - a little longer due to head winds.  The Boeing 777 ER flights great.  Smoother flying than most of the roads we traveled on in Africa!  Go figure!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Elite Experience,"This airline maintains its elite service standard.  The flight attendants are friendly and very helpful.  On my return trip, a passenger had a health incident, and the flight attendant rearranged passenger seats to make her more comfortable, without making those around her uncomfortable or drama.  It was very profeesionally handled.  The food to purchase is pretty good. I had one seat in the back of the plane, but never felt squeezed in.  Checking in the day before is so very convenient.  I feel like this airline has been able to make the passenger feel as part of a herd."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,New transatlantic service,"I was pleasantly surprised by the new forms of service now offered by Delta in economy class...hot towels, ear phones, sleep masks, good wine, a salad entry for dinner...just 100% better than a similar flight on Delta in the past few years."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,This was an overnight flight.,"The plane was an Airbus A380 I believe. The legroom was very adequate, we did not feel cramped. The flight was 7 hours. The seats had tabs that supported you head if you wanted to sleep. The food was better than we expected. We were very pleased with delta and their service on this flight."
Date of travel: May 2019,10,NEVER AGAIN,"Welcome to the cattle market. Packem in and sell em cheap. Do not bother with your health, that you're adequately hydrated, and ensuring customers are comfortable. Boarding is a joke. The tannoy system is inaudible, the check in opens late. The phone app is just wrong. I got more accurate information looking at the boards. I spent most of my trip trying not to get into argument with travellers who thought my seat was theirs and no staff to discuss this with. Never ever again and will never recommend this service to my worst enemy."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Delta in a class of its own,"I fly a lot between work and my side gig and sometimes get pinned on United or American due to time restraints.  There is no comparison to what Delta provides. They friendliness, clean airplane and overall experience is next to none."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Bermuda,"Great flight, less than 3 hours. This flight is on a smaller plane, very comfortable seating, no real need to upgrade seating."
n/a,50,Delta flight from JFK to DAY,"Took the 6 AM flight from JFK to DAY last Nov. 1.  Had to wait about an hour at Terminal 4 after seeing my wife off, then transferred to Terminal 2 which is Delta's.  I had a couple hours to wait so  after the AirTrain dropped me off at Terminal 2 I looked around for a place to sit because I wanted to rest before going through TSA. There was none so I decided to check in using one of the kiosks.  Not very user-friendly but I got my boarding pass printed after a couple of tries. TSA was extra strict, even asking us to take shoes off. Anyway, the actual flight was uneventful. The cabin was very tight even for my 5 foot 2 Filipino frame, haha. I had the window seat and had a huge 300 lbs I guess, seatmate, who could barely fit in the seat. The takeoff and landing at DAY was very smooth.  All in all, thumbs up for Delta."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great flight,Great flight with wonderful attendants. Only wish seats were a tad bigger on Main cabin. Easy flight
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Niece Flight,"A  niece flight, flight crew was attentive and plesant, boarding was quick.  Flight was on time with no problems"
Date of travel: October 2019,10,Terrible Review of Delta Air lines  - Is this a common practice by delta,"I recently had a horrible experience and want to know if this happens a lot. I did not find much info about it in delta airline reviews so perhaps this is common from Toronto airport but not from elsewhere.Eeverything went smoothly at Pearson airport for my YYZ- South America flight via Atlanta with a 2 hour layover. However, as boarding started, I noticed that my zone was not being called despite having a seat at the back of the plane. One by one, all zones were called and almost every single passenger boarded the plane. Finally my zone was called, there were only 4-5 passengers in that zone and as soon as agent announced boarding for our zone, the front of the line was barricaded and I was told that all of us will have to forget about carry-on luggage (irrespective of the size) as there is no space left in the air craft. On top pf that they said that the carry on will only be given back to us at final destination and will be transported as checked luggage. I was totally shocked and protested that I need the carry on with me as I will be flying for next 15 hours. After all there is a reason why someone carries valuables in the carry on but as soon as I argued with their staff, they pulled me on one side and and said - Take his luggage off, he is not flying. I pleaded with them to keep carry on bag in aircraft & hand it over to me at Atlanta while exiting the aircraft so that I can carry it with me during next flight to South America but nope. The only reply i got was what is your number, you are being off loaded etc etc. Even telling them repeatedly that my final destination is next day away and in another continent made no difference at all.it goes without saying that airline staff had stared the boarding quite late so flight was already late by few minutes, everyone else had already boarded so it became a brain numbing situation. For once I thought about cancelling the flight but most of hotel reservations were non refundable. As I was still in a state of shock and trying to reason with extremely rude Delta staff at Pearson airport, they told me that they are closing the plane door so I will have to take the snap decision - fly without carry on till my final destination or not fly at all. Due to panic and threats I could not even think of taking out important items from carry on with the result that as soon as plane took off, I realized I had left my wallet with money and credit cards in the outer, unlocked pocket of carry on. The rest of the money, phones etc, were also in the carry on which of course was not locked. It was a nightmare to think what would happen if I land in a new country, a continent away, with no money or credit card or phone.This is how I traveled for almost 15 hours before reuniting with my carry on and its valuables. What a great start to a vacation.I travel frequently but this is first time in 30 years that this kind of terrible heavy handedness was belted out to me.So my question is - Is this common practice with Delta Airline and specially by their Toronto staff?"
Date of travel: November 2019,10,The worst experience I ever had,"At the beginning the flight was delayed for 2 hours. They informed us on a very short notice when we were already at the airport. Then they announced further delay for additional hour, then two more hours! eventually the flight was delayed 5 hours. No proper waiting area at the airport. no apology, they do not provide any extra service in case of delays nor even apology"
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Last leg of trip from Australia,"Leg room very tight, on board entertainment was disfunctional - streaming was extremely choppy and interrupted,seat-mate said it was due to my earphones which function fine for anything else. Snack was miniscule bag of cheezits and tiny cup of water on over a 3.5 hour flight. On short flights in Australia, snack was packet of veggies and dip with unlimited water available. Flight attendants were friendly, arrived on time, baggage sent through"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Best Airline,"I fly Delta a lot. I’ve diamond for years and I’m million miler, so I am biased due to better service I get due to my status. Still, delta suites is the best business class of any airline I’ve flown in business, at least 15, mostly Sky Team, but not only. I also used to think delta food was the best till the Alitalia flight I just completed.Big difference in seat comfort between standard delta one and delta suites."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Great Customer Service!,"I am an amputee, and need wheelchair assistance. Their skycap came curb side to assist me right to the gate. He was extremely accommodating and courteous. The entire flight crew was very helpful as well. I have food allergies and had ordered a special meal well prior to my flight. Sadly somewhere along the line, it was missed. They went out of their way to find me more than enough food to eat that was actually very good; it was over an 11 hour flight. Once I landed, I was greeted by wheelchair assistance to take me to my connecting flight. Even though in Beijing, they really do not speak English, they had me talk to their phone to have it translated. They were very accommodating with a few of my requests prior to my next flight. I was delighted with everything."
Date of travel: May 2019,40,"Atlanta to Johannesburg and back, May/June 2019","I am no stranger to long airplane flights but this one, clocking in at roughly 15 hours ATL-JNB, and roughly 16 hours JNB-ATL is one of the longest flights in the world so I boarded the aircraft wondering just how fifteen hours in a tube at 30,000 ft with a plane load of strangers was going to go. This was doubly true as I made the mistake of reading a whole bunch of reviews prior to boarding that made the trip sound epic, especially in coach. The truth is that it was a long, boring flight, but it was very doable, even with one’s spouse and 8 year old child in tow. Delta treats coach passengers pretty humanely on this flight. The seats were fairly comfortable, and by 2019 airplane standards also fairly wide; something more than 18 inches I believe. I’m 5’10 and burly at roughly 220 lbs, and except for my shoulders which are very wide,  I fit quite nicely into the seat. The one thing the seats didn’t do was recline adequately, and after a time in one position it became murderously hard on my tailbone. I rectified this on our return flight by purchasing a cheap but soft pillow at the JNB terminal. This made all the difference and I got a surprisingly good rest on the way home. Meals were also pretty humane; I had a gratis glass of red wine prior to and again after the evening meal which we ordered off a short menu which was presented at our seats about an hour into the flight. The selection of seatback entertainment was adequate for the length of the journey, both going and coming. I used the eyeshades Delta provided and my own noise canceling headphones to create a space quiet enough to doze through long stretches of the flight. For those times when one was awake and felt like moving about the cabin the Delta flight attendants thoughtfully left bottled water and snacks mid plane. When my body told me it was morning I spent some time talking to the flight attendants in the back of the aircraft with a gratis cup of coffee. Both boarding the plane and deplaning went smoothly and surprisingly quickly. We knew we were going to be quite wiped out on arrival in Johannesburg so we paid an escort from Bidvest to help us with our luggage and get us to and through customs. We repaired to the Intercontinental at JNB for a meal and a good nights rest before beginning our safari and tourist itinerary the following day."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Excellent crew,Excellent service. On time flight. Counter service in SLC was also excellent. Meal was actually quite good.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Amazing from start to finish,"Having flown with Delta once before and had a good experience I knew they would be a safe bet. We flew to New York on Delta's new upgraded economy service and it surpassed all expectations. We were greeted on board with a smile and shortly after take off we were handed bottles of water, warm towels to freshen up then peach bellinis to welcome us on board.We were then offered a menu and I chose the Gnocchi which was delicious. We had a choice of starter and a lovely pudding. Drinks were offered frequently and we also had a snack about an hour before landing, all of which was very tasty. The flight attendants were exceptional and couldn't do enough for you. One charming lady attendant even wished my daughter good luck with her future career. It was so amazing to be flying in economy with such wonderful staff. I really cannot recommend Delta highly enough and I do hope they continue with the upgraded economy service. The plane was clean and in flight wifi ( albeit £23 ) worked nearly the entire duration and I could keep in touch with family on the ground. All in all, an incredible flight - thanks Delta. You beat your codeshare counterpart ( VA )hands down on customer service."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Cross country flight,Nice large comfortable seat...good service...nice attentive staff. Great selection of movies and music
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Delta - America's best airline?,"We flew to France on a 10-day trip. The food on the plane going over was the usual main cabin so-so fare.  Coming back two days ago, everything had changed. Delta has ramped up its main cabin food offerings and it truly was a nice improvement."
Date of travel: November 2019,10,Rotten,"The only good thing about the flight was that the pilot got us there in Less time than advertised. Firstly I, and several others did not get the seats we booked as others were in them. We had to stand and wait until others had sat down to see what seats were left. Leg room was minimal. The stewardess came round and handed us all hot pieces of cloth...straight from roasting water into our hand...dinner was a choice of three frankly rotten ""meals"" I asked the stewardess what chicken marsala was..she yelled at me to look at the menu, that it was an Indian dish (it's actually American/Italian food) so we ordered a chicken salad...eh..4 tiny strips of chicken and some rocket leaves...yeah very nourishing.  Breakfast time promised cinnamon bun and a drink.... except we had to ask for ours as we were forgotten about.All in all it was a rotten experience and I hope never to have to experience it again"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Amazing!,"Wonderful crew, amazing flight, beautiful menu, and great destination... couldn't have asked for anything more!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,good flight / just long,"The flight was fine. It helps to have movies to watch and live tv by dish. Seats were okay but that is to be expected at the economy level. Way better than spirit airlines thoughStaff was good and flight was smooth. I just wish Delta would board differentAfter first class, people that need help, military, and delta members i wish they would load from back to front. just makes sense"
Date of travel: October 2019,30,First class in name only,"Airbus A319 DEN-SEA and B757 SEA-OGG and was truly surprised by how bad it was. First surprise: After paying for first class I would (to paraphrase Boris Johnson's hyperbole) rather be found dead in a ditch than pay another 40 bucks to use the lounge. I found the seats to be uncomfortable and cramped (particularly the B757), the food unappetizing, the B757dirty. Don't know about the IFE on the B757 because it was broken. The cabin crew were great, but I generally don't bother them for anything. On the return trip the food was much better, but still not what I would expect for the price.Part of this is my fault because I can't help comparing them with business class in Edelweiss (excellent!), JAL, Lufthansa, Air Canada and even a disappointing trip with United in what turned out to be Faux-laris. The Delta flight was much more comparable with recent flights with Easy Jet (Europe) and Southwest. How much was that we spent on Delta First? Won't make that mistake again.Delta, if you're listening, not allowing paid Z class into the lounge is an insult that ensures that I will never want to be one of your ""valued"" customers."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Return flight not as good,The flight out of JFK was very good in terms of service but from CUN back to JFK the was only one attendant running 1st class so the service was slow.  No beverages offered until we were at cruising altitude. Would have given 5 stars had it not been for that.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Consistently Good Service,Delta always provides the experience one expects.  Check-in lines not excessive; quick baggage check; informative gate agents; on-time departures; efficient flight attendants; decent leg room.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,comfortable left & arrived on time,"comfortable, left & arrived on time.  Good selection of snacks. Keto friendly, beverages available in diet and caffeine free."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,The Adventure Begns,Delta comfort is a good option depending on price and length of flight. We had a number of points to apply so it helped with pricing. Seats are more comfortable but nothing approaching business class. We both have long legs so the room between seats was helpful. Staff was courteous. Meals were standard for a European flight..
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Unexpected Pleasure,"After a great multi location vacation in the States comes the inevitable flight back to the UK.Usually only a nesessity to get home,and in economy not really expecting a lot(based on many long haulflights this year)in economy.Early evening flight that was arriving back in the UK early next morning,no problem.We would sleep all the way back.WRONG.We didn't need to!Boston Logan airport was made for passengers.Easy to navigate,we soon were boarding on our Delta flight home.The flight experience itself was superb.Comfortable seats,great service from a great team and the food was the best we had been served in years.The menu gave multiple choices to cover all tastes and requirements.Plenty of liquids offered continuously.This was so unexpected.And in Economy!Delta have really impressed.They have certainly done their research well.Business and First Class on any airline are always good but to give passengers in economy such a really positive experience,virtually guarantees repeat bookings.On this performance,Delta will definitely see us again.A great flight,and nice to feel valued as a customer.Thank you Delta."
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Atlanta to Guangzhou flight-there are better options,"Flight was below average.  Seats were not very comfortable. I am 6-2 and did not fit in business class seat when it reclined.  Feet were hitting bottom and there was no room to move.  Flight attendants were a bit snarky and would rather stand in galley and talk to each other than to help out customers. Tv and movies seemed dated, and no new Hollywood hits playing.  Food was good,  bathrooms  were cleaned and maintained, boarding of plane seemed to take a really long time.  If you are looking for a great experience, this is not it!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,The A330 is a beautiful aircraft and the BEST flight ever to JFK!,"From the moment of boarding and receiving a very warm welcome from the cabin crew I knew I was in for a good experience with the new Delta upgrades! The crew at ALL times could not do enough for us....serving bellinis/wine and even a brandy. I have dietary needs and these were met with an excellent menu that was spot on.! Wow...wonderful headphones that actually fitted and also worked plus a superb choice of films. I felt that I was flying ""Premium"" rather than economy. In future ( I have been to NYC seven times) I will now ALWAYS fly with Delta as the flight home to LHR with a different airline (V) was in comparison  abysmal to say the least. so WELL DONE ""DELTA"" and thank-you for giving me the best flight ever to NYC!"
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Delta has improved very well,I'm remembering flights with Delta Airlines maybe 10 years ago - this was an awful experience.Now Delta Airlines has improved very much. The Airplane was clean and comfortable. The service is good and the very experienced flight attendants are always kind and attentive.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,They were more than helpful,"Delta was the airline covering Korean Airlines, which had very good service, clean plane, food etc. had wheelchair upon arrival at two airports that took me to baggage claim and  connecting gate.Delta"
Date of travel: November 2019,20,Flight ,Crew was very rude and asking for a water was like I curse her out. Very poor customer service that’s why I always recommend Jetblue
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Superb!,This flight was superb!  The communication before the trip was excellent.  The flight departed on time which is fantastic.  Although we all know that departing on Tome could be impacted by many non controllable factors.  The customer service onboard was great.  The flight attendants were courteous and professional.  The food was really good and the number of services offered was adequate.  The boarding was organized. The pilot also provided the right amount of information throughout the flight.  Everything that the Delta crew could control went well.  I was really satisfied with the flight.  I will definitely choose Delta again.
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Poor customer service,"Our flight from LHR was late departing due to engine fault on virgins Dreamliner. This resulted in us missing our connecting flight. Delta ground staff should have been notified that some of its customers had connecting flights, but no staff to meet us. We went to recheck in desk where the delta woman had not interest in helping us, in fact down right rude. Thanks to DFW staff we were told where to book our onward journey. Even then Delta ground crew messed up our booking. Nearly 6 hours later our connection took off. Yes Delta had no interest in us. Maybe best if I use another airline for future transatlantic flights"
n/a,30,Air Travel sucks.,"I know the more seats the more money. But holy crap, when my short legs hit the seat in front of me that's just nuts I know they have comfort seats available but 69$ a seat really!!!!! Even the service carts are monsters to come down the isle. Don't have your elbow hanging out. Lately every plane that I have been on is over booked. Put more planes in the air. The service from attendants is first rate."
Date of travel: January 2019,30,Got us there,"We always fly without checking bags on Delta. Delta has lost our bags st least 3 times due to delayed flights. On our honeymoon to Antigua in 1988, our bags were given to us 4 days later, because they went through Atlanta in the winter season. Luckily, it was our honeymoon and did not need  much. It is told as a joke every year now. Flew in January 1988 instead o January 2019 below. Allow at least 3 hours for check in."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Great Airlines,Our trip was long on the way there. We were on the runway 2 extra hours because of weather and the employees did not supply the airplane. The crew kept us comfortable and were very apologetic. I was able to catch up on some sleep :).
Date of travel: November 2019,30,"Smooth flight, but very cramped seating",Delta employees were friendly and helpful and the flight was smooth. But the plane seating was extremely tight and very uncomfortable flight. Me and my wife are small people and I can't imagine how larger people fit in the seats.  And I wasn't going to pay double the price for first class seating. Will probably think of another airline next drip to LA with larger seats.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,It's Hard to Eat Airline Food after a European Vacation,"The direct flight from theses two cities makes a European trip very easy. We spent some days in Amsterdam after being in Portugal and staying in that city rather than flying directly home. Why not?Premium Economy makes a hugh difference. The attendants were very helpful. The airline now serves a drink for PE at the top of the flight, which is thoughtful. The entertainment options were many. The first meal was quite good, actually..a chicken salad with big pieces of chicken rather than mixed into mayonnaise. The second, at the end of the trip was for me inedible...warmed, was melted. etc. I am amazed how at times other passengers can rip into junk food. It was a comfortable trip in spite of its length. And...the drivers up front were great."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,delta delight:,"service was good from Detroit to korea,then very good from korea to bkk...Korean airlines has a much better crew than delta...Asian culture is so classy.."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Good economy,"Plane was fairly new and had the latest economy class seat. Leg room & comfort were some of the best, better than Virgin Atlantic 747 offering. Entertainment system was good but you need to bring your own headphones. Staff & service was everything you expect from a legacy carrier"
Date of travel: December 2018,20,Horribly uncomfortable,"Delta, upon boarding, bragged that this was a brand new aircraft and we were one of the first few trips to be boarded. I suppose that was to impress us, but what it meant was that there were more seats crammed on to the same size aircraft, eliminating almost any leg room between seats. Tightest quarters I've ever flown and they should be outlawed for international flight."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Use a wheelchair in airport and it was always waiting for me!,"Always on time. - very cordial - captain greeted everyone,  economy class very nice@-Wheel chair attendant even"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,This was the second part of a long haul flight to orlando from boston.,"Fantastic, what a complete contrast to virgin. (first part of our journey). The seats were wider and so much more comfortable. Lots of padding and a lot more leg room. Seats were clean and so was my tray. In flight entertainment was good too. Snacks and drinks were freely available too. Staff were polite and helpful too. I would definitely fly with delta again. I also flew home with delta, from orlando to detroit then from detroit to heathrow. Well looked after all the way. Even though they are linked to virgin, there is a vast contrast between the 2, delta are fantastic."
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Don't change flights at JFK!,"Delta economy is certainly bare bones. Flying international, after hop from a domestic flight, so we had to get our bags and schlep them 5 blocks to next terminal. TSA was atrocious, but not the fault of Delta.  JFK is a slum.  Also, make sure to pack your own high quality ear buds to plug into their seat back jacks.  Also blow-up pillows to make flight much more tolerable.  If you have hungry nervous children (or husband), get a 'Special Meal' and you'll be served first. Or pack your own sandwich, apples, etc. since food is typical of airline food. We always bring a 'Hydroflask' (empty thru TSA) and fill with the water bottle dispensers all airports seem to now have.  Stay hydrated."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Good flight,People on plane where nice. It was clean I am thankful for the game tv screens they have. It really comes in handy when you have kids or a long flight.
Date of travel: February 2019,30,Will I get home?,"Whilst I can’t fault the flight or Service on board, US airlines over sell flights, hoping that some people won’t turn up. So despite, paying and checking in for the return flight, when we got to the airport, we had no seats, this can get very stressful. The airline, increasingly desperately call for people to change their flight, whilst at the same time the Americans wait until the last moment, holding out for the maximum compensation. This is all very well if you are used to it and have no commitments, but for most of us, it certainly takes the gilt off of the experience."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,"On time, good crew",On time departure and arrival. Good crew and even the main meal was reasonable.Aircraft was clean. The Airbus A330 was certainly better that some of the older Boeing 767-300s
Date of travel: November 2019,30,First Class didn't measure up,"We flew first class and were disappointed at the size of the planes.  Very small, overhead compartments were small.  But the service was good even though not as nice as first class standards in the larger planes."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Perfect flight,Our direct flight from Detroit to Rome went so smooth and perfect everything ran exactly as it should have. The crew was very courteous and very prompt and timely on all their services.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Ran out of snacks,"After helping my sister move to Fort Myers from Atlanta she flew me home. Arriving an hour before departure check in was smooth; security the same. Boarding went well (full flight). We actually left ten minutes early. Service was what you'd expect from Delta. My only gripe is sitting in Row 39 I was listening to beverage/snack service. There was an option as to what snack you wanted. Imagine my surprise when the flight attendant hands me a two cookie pack of Biscoff! ""sorry-we ran out of snacks"". The guy sitting next to me and I just looked at each other! Really Delta-you run out of snacks on a full flight? At today's prices that's totally unacceptable. Thank God it was a short flight!"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"On time, courteous crew members, smooth flight","The flight attendants and the captain and his co-pilot, were super nice. Seats were quite comfortable, even in economy class. The service was only beverages and snacks, but for an hour's flight were enough. Thank you Delta."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,"Great airline, price and connections","Great service on time and over all good experience , over all will fly again Great connections Good entertainment"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Adjusted to plane issue well,"Our plane had steering issues, but Delta was able to find a new plane quickly. They were very informative about the process. Due to their quick problem resolution and tail winds, we arrive only a couple minutes later than the original time."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,As always delta makes the grade,"Whenever I fly Delta I most always find them to be running on time, professional, courteous, and friendly. And this flight to Phoenix and then back to Seattle was no exception. Well done to all at Delta Airlines."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,"great service, uncomfortable seat and insufficient leg room","Comfort+ is like the old economy seating.  Seats are too small, and leg room is insufficient for comfort."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Reliable and Consistent,"I like to fly Delta Comfort+...The little extra cost is worth the extras that you get.  Things like priority boarding, so you can find a place to stow your carry on, and free drinks for those extra long flights."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Best ever,"I have had type 1 Diabetes for 50 years and I was traveling solo on this long International flight. I normally travel with my wife but this time I was meeting friends traveling from Seattle Washington and meeting them at  the Paris airport. I was traveling flight DL42 originally from Toronto then transferring at St Paul then onto Paris France. Long flight for a solo Type 1 Diabetic considering sleep disruptions and time changes.... The staff on board this flight were courteous. Friendly. Polite and aware of my uneasiness traveling by my self. They made sure my tray was taken before other people so I could go and give insulin and check blood sugar levels. Wish every flight I took over the years was as efficient as this group of staff! I would fly Delta again in a second! (I flew DL42 November2nd, 2019 seat 35E)"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Delta is the best,Always excellent to fly with Delta.  We go to Miami twice a month and it has been such a pleasure to fly with Delta.  Takes the stress out of travelling when you interact with real professionals that know how to make your trip seamless.  Best cookies ever and snacks.  Starbucks coffee and a crew that is committed to our comfort and safety.The Delta Sky club is fantastic as well and totally worth every visit before our trip both in LGA and MIA.
n/a,50,Excellent sevice,No problem at all. Excellent first class all run like clockwork. The staff was up on there feet for the whole flight . Lovely food and plenty to drink bag were waiting with no delays .will definitely be flying with them again.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Very Pleasant Experience,"Just got back from a roundtrip to Seattle.  We flew Delta, and it was a thoroughly enjoyable flight ......... and these days, that is rare.  The planes were fairly new, the seats were very comfortable and there was even decent leg room.  We were in economy.  The beverage service was pretty standard, and the free cookies helped pass the time a little."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,"Smaller plane, good service and on time","Smaller plane with smaller overhead bins, but had enough room for our flight. Crew was nice and service good. Good choice of movies"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Delta Rocks,Great flight. Great seats. Great flight crew. Flight was on schedule. I will definitely continue to fly Delta for most of my trips. GoGo WiFi worked great on this newer 737-900ER.
n/a,50,Excellent service,"Staff, meals, details, service, timing, smiles, multimedia and everything was perfect. Thanks to the staff from DL127 who where extremely friendly. Quality of food was excellent and on time. We even had mimosas. We will fly again with you."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,A short visit to NC USA,"Recently I decided to fly to Charleston SC to visit my partners' father. After I spoke to him many times online my partner expressed her wish for me to know her dad personally and spend some time with them both at his place in Sun City in Bluffton SC. We used Delta Airlines miles to purchase this trip. I must say for the dates we chose, the miles needed for this trip were much lower than our expectations so we were very happy with this. I flew out of Aruba and since it was a short trip I didn't need more than my backpack and a carry on. I checked in online and had no issues with this. At the Aruba Airport Delta airline counter the agents were helpfull and effective since the line was moving at a good pace. The info at the gate was accurate and clear, the boarding process was well organized. I chose an isle seat since I can't sleep in a seated position and therefore take that seat to avoid waking up fellow passengers when I need to go to the bathroom. I love the choice of the board entertainment and the fact that it's free. The flight attendants were very helpful and genuinly friendly. The trip was smooth, a turbulence is a weather phenomenon so a bumby ride cannot be attributed to the carrier nor the crew. Being an experienced traveler I know this and therefore won't comment on the bumbs the weather throws my way. Arriving in Atlanta and being an experienced traveler I searched the monitors and went to my next departing gate that was actually the one we arrived into. The rest of the trip (the leg to Charleston) was equal to the one from Aruba so I will not repeat the same story and bore you to death. LOL.Returning to Aruba was challenging because the online system kept requesting a return date and didn't recognize the fact that I was returning home and not visiting Aruba thus I could not check in online. This repeated itself at the self checkin station at the Charleston Airport. I was then assisted by a gate agent and had to prove I was a resident of Aruba and having a European Union passport didn't help but this is only a fact because Aruba is still part of the Dutch Kingdom, thus our nationality is Dutch even when we are legal citizens of Aruba. It's a good thing that I had my General Health Insurance card that proves I live there legally with me (because only legal residents are covered by the General Health Insurance) to prove I have an address there and my travel insurance docs also proved the info that my home address is in Aruba. This may need some looking into by the IT people that manage the Delta online check in feature. Other than that (and the minor fact that the weather caused a delay taking off in Charleston) I made my connecting flight in Atlanta and the rest of the story remains the same. I sure plan to fly delta again out of Aruba."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,They really listen to their customers,"Back in September my flight got cancelled. I was very upset at the time. In my head, I never wanted to fly with Delta again. BUT delta explained to me the situation, apologized to me and compensated me for what happened. They made me feel like my voice won’t go unheard or ignored. Customer service is really important for me. In the future, if I have an option to fly with delta or any of its affiliates, i wouldn’t even think twice"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,special help,delta people were so helpful with pushing me around to my next flight in a wheel chair. They helped with tickets and departure and any stops in between to the restroom.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Friendly skies,"The gentleman at the counter was so friendly, you could tell he loved his job... clean and comfortable area. Just know that you are walking outside and up stairs to the plane entrance- so carrying your personal items / carryon bags up stairs."
Date of travel: November 2019,10,Fumes and Only drinks for first class passengers showing how Delta airline discriminates against passengers,"The plane’s fumes filled the Cabin when the pilot started the planes engine after being pushback from the gate. The pilot Then circulated the air in the cabin so the jet fuel fumes were everywhere. When the plane landed the pilot could not pull the plane into the gate so once again the fumes came into the cabin for over 40 minutes and filled the cabin as we sat on the tarmac. I flew two flights to get from Fort Myers to Richmond and on both flights they said it was too bumpy to service the passengers, and on both flights the first class passengers were all getting service.  This was clearly discrimination based on class of passengers, a class action lawsuit will be filed."
Date of travel: November 2019,10,Delta damaged my $1000 martin guitar,Worst flight experience ever. As a traveling musician was told needed to pink tag my guitar and assured it would be taken care of. Come to find out when I get home there was a major crack in body of guitar. Original claim was flat out declined with poor copy and paste email. After complaint very minute repair fee was offered. As a gold member who spends thousands a year on flying delta was hoping for a little more respect. Not to mention flight was delayed numerous times with poor flow boarding.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great Service!,"Great service on the plane and on the phone!My flight was during the day, departing Dusseldorf 11:30 am, and arriving in Miami at 7:07 pm, the punctuality was awesome.I was in Economy and was welcomed with a hot towel, a bottle of water and a Bellini. Lunch had 2 choices, plus wine, beer, coffee, tea, or soda.Later a hot cookie with juice, later a pizza and ice cream.Good selection of entertainment.The crew was nice.The airplane was on the oldy side  but was clean and comfortable.First time flying Delta, and will continue to do so."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Good,Delta flew a fairly new plane where there is reduced legroom.Flight attendants are friendly and efficient.
Date of travel: November 2019,20,Travelling first with Delta doesn’t give lounge access,I was very disappointed to arrive to SFO terminal 1 for my first class flight (business class if you are European) to be too be told that you can not access the lounge unless you are flying international (it is a domestic terminal) or you have an Amex card. Why not just rename the lounge the AMEX Lounge as it has nothing to do with Delta. So lessons learnt don’t fly delta domestic first class!!!!
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Annika & Robin are lovely flight attendants!,"One of my most enjoyable flights with Delta Airlines.  Robin was such a delightful woman, drink service was very professional and she just had such a pleasant personality and smile the entire flight.  For Delta executives, it was flight #5296 on 11.13.19.  These young women deserve much praise their superiors."
Date of travel: November 2019,10,A good airline until there’s a problem,"Flight DL 84 from Atlanta to Paris on November 15th was a Charlie Foxtrot. The flight was delayed by more than 3 hours. They couldn’t get the Auxiliary Power Unit to connect properly to the air craft. Stuff happens however the communication from Delta’s gate crew was less than ideal. They did not notify us of a delay until after the boarding time had come and gone, they started out with a 20 minute delay, then it was 15 more minutes, then 15 more minutes, etc., the app and flight tracker were a better source of information. When they finally got it working, we had to wait for the aircraft to warm up. Then we boarded and someone was sick all over the seats, needless to say the cleaning crew had to come on, however at no time did they tell us why we were delayed. They didn’t say anything until the cleaning crew were finished. When we landed they had boarding passes for some of the delayed passengers but not all of the delayed passengers, so some of us had to get in line with Air France to get our boarding passes. They did give us a coupon for 15 Euros for food. The communication from Delta left a lot to be desired. By time I arrive at my final destination I will have been traveling for 24 hrs. Stuff happens and sometimes it is beyond the control of the airline, what separates the good from the bad is how they handle it. This brought back memories of why I had stopped flying Delta years ago. I started with Delta again because they are better than American and marginally better than United, however the way they handled this leaves me questioning that decision."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Delta flight,"I haven’t flew Delta for quite some time. I was pleasantly surprised. Although our flight time was changed months ago, all the legs of flights were on time. Flight attendants for a most part were friendly and helpful."
Date of travel: November 2019,20,"""Off"" Trip on a Good Airline","I went to the airport and needed to change my date of travel.  The wait was a little long at the Elite Desk.  I was finally issued travel documents and went to TSA.Due to insufficient documents, TSA sent me back to the ticket counter.The ticket counter added one added boarding document and sent me back to TSA.TSA checked me.  I went to the gate, where my boarding documents were still not adequate.On the flight the staff did not give me a full can of soda for a 2 hr 15 min flight.Arriving in Boston, our gate was available, but there was a 10-15 minute delay to get ground crew to position us at the Gate.Delta normally does much better, and earned this review."
Date of travel: November 2019,10,Delta sucks,For the 6th time Delta screwed-up my TSA Precheck. Customer service agents have no idea how the system works. This time they made a big joke of it pointing at each other saying it's her fault. I fly weekly and try to avoid Delta. Begging for them to get acquired.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Mexico vacation,"Our flight on Delta airlines was fantastic! Love that you are able to watch a movie when flying to your destination, as it makes time go by so quickly! The staff on board was very nice and accommodating! Will always fly Delta when possible!"
n/a,40,Easy and Fun,"Super easy check in and friendly, smiling staff! We liked the entertainment center in the headrest on the seat in front of us. The flight was smooth and on time. We didn't buy food on the flight but we did have the complimentary drinks and snacks. The scenery was beautiful and included a view of Mt Rainier."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,all our flights were good,I love Delta the crew is always nice . some seats need to be replaced they are a little worn . just wish they had a no stop flight from Pitsburgh to Las Vegas . Also customer service was very helpful dumy me booked a wrong date and I had no problem changing my flight
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Interesting Boarding Process,"The first strike against Delta came when they decided to board to two planes simultaneously with the gates adjacent to each other. It was difficult to hear which gate was boarding which tiered class and there was some obvious confusion among passengers. The second strike against Delta came when I realized they didn't follow the typical boarding process. Usually airlines board you by groups so it becomes very obvious if you're the next group to board. Delta, however, has basic, comfort, premium, and some other tiers. Unless you frequently fly Delta, you're probably going to have a hard time finding out if you're next to board or not. The flight, otherwise, was smooth and we arrived on time. I didn't dock any points for this next comment as this isn't Delta's fault. As a passenger, make sure you disembark the plane in the same order as your seats. Trying to get ahead will only make the process slower. Are you about to miss a flight? Guess what! There's probably 30 or 40 other people that need to rush to their connecting flight as well."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,"Good experience, but no food!","Good and friendly crew, timely, and helpful.  But we waited to eat on the plane.  They only offered one sandwich on the menu as it was, but they didn’t even have that!  So we nibbled hungrily on weird, yucky snack stuff on 3 hour flight during dinner hour!  Disappointing and unkind to stomach.  Otherwise all went well."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Surprisingly enjoyable flight,Flew from Phoenix to JFK non-stop on one of Delta’s 737 jets.  Service was good.  Flight left on time & arrived early.  Entertainment system on these planes are pretty good including live tv which passes the time rather quickly.  Seat comfort & leg room were tolerable.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Quick Getaway to NYC,We love Delta’s non-stop service to NYC from MSP. Multiple departure choices maximize our long weekend time in the city. We fly Delta Comfort Plus and it’s perfect for a fairly short flight (just over two hours)...just enough time for a movie via their entertainment system. Cocktails are gratis. The flights leave on time and usually arrive early both ways. Flight attendants are pleasant and attentive. They overheard it was our 32 wedding anniversary and we received a sweet postcard from the flight crew with first class cookies. This is an annual trip for us and our preferred way to travel to the Big Apple.
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Disappointment,"We were traveling to the mainland with paid upgrade on our DFW leg.  Flight into LA was delayed landing so we missed out connection.  When we landed I proceeded to guest service to rebook my DFW leg.  Well they could not put us back in first class, not even Delta Comfort which I paid full price for.  We got placed into main cabin 1.  I fly with Delta all the time and first time I felt we were not serviced.  So it makes for a very long travel day.😠"
Date of travel: October 2019,40,"Flight was comfortable, service fine.","This direct flight to JFK was more convenient than our flight into Milan (also on Delta, with final Amsterdam-Milan flight by Air Italia)."
Date of travel: November 2019,30,"Great Crew, dated Equipment","Recently flew from Paris to Minneapolis as the final leg of an overseas business trip.  These long flights are never too fun but I felt the Delta crew was positive, friendly and attentive.  Boarding in Paris was bizarre, they seemed very inexperienced and let the Priority members board before Comfort Plus (which are all priority members).  However, the plane left a lot to be desired.   This flight was on a Boeing 767.  Boeing planes never seem as comfortable as the Airbus planes and this one was quite dated.  It had the lovely 5"" (I'm guessing) video screens with a very limited number of selections.  My seat was about as comfortable as a rock.  The fold in tray table could hardly be opened as well.  Please refurbish your equipment Delta!  Flight was on-time and smooth across the board.  And a really cool view of the southern tip of Greenland was a highlight."
Date of travel: November 2019,10,Forgotten ...,This was my second first class flight as part of a one stop layover. Every time I asked for something I was forgotten and had to ask twice.   Not really worth it.  Flight attendants slightly self absorbed.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Fantastic Delta airlines experience.,"First time I have flown with Delta airlines and what a great service. They launched a new international economy cabin service on my flight, which consisted of welcome cocktails, warm towels and complimentary branded snacks and drinks throughout. The food served at meal times was great…I’d even be happy with it if I went to a restaurant. The whole experience felt more like an event, rather than a routine flight. Congratulations to the Delta team for delivering this. Wheelchair assistance was great throughout as well. The only drawback is the upholstery is looking a bit tired."
Date of travel: June 2019,50,Very enjoyable star to finish,"The second time on Delta so I know that the first one was not a fluke, From on time boarding, in flight service, comfort, entertainment and Pilots colorful interesting comments all for just a few dollars more than the cattle airlines."
Date of travel: July 2019,40,Fly Delta to Salt Lake City,"On this trip NO SOUTHWEST(see my review) and disabled, small children boarded first then those that paid extra to board. We left on time, had leg room at seat with a TV, A fresh snack, free drink, and good crew.  All for $20 or so more."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,An eleven hour flight with a great crew and great service.,Delta Airline crew made this an enjoyable flight. Good snacks and drinks and a very good hot meal. The attitude and work ethic of this crew demands much praise. Long international flights are never tremendous unless you fly first class. The crew assisted in making this good experience. The entertainment system was very good with a very assortment of movie options. Will not hesitate to book flights on Delta in the future.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,"Great flight, Great crew",Ten hour flights are never the high lite of any trip. The Delta crew made this flight enjoyable. The plane was as clean as you could expect. The crew was friendly and the service was good. The food served was adequate considering we were in an economy class. The entertainment system was very good and the range of movies were better than expected. Delta does it right.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Delta Airlines Flight Manchester - Detroit 11/2019,"flight left on time, was a Canadair CRJ900, flight was ok, not bumpy, crew was friendly even when it was 7.00 a.m., whe nwe landed everything was white and it snowed all morning, continued to Mexico"
Date of travel: November 2019,20,High End Cruise,My mother who is 80 booked a very expensive cruise with first class on Delta through a travel agency. I was shocked not allowed into the lounge. OMG..three hour lay over. Fly 1st class Alaska. Lounge access. Totally not a Delta fan. Very cheap not to allow first class passengers into Lounge.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Top Notch international service,"Only our second international flight, and we were very impressed with the service.  They were constantly tending to the passengers, making sure we had everything we needed to be comfortable for the long non-stop flight.  Food, beverages, hot towels, all the extras too, couldnt have been better really!"
n/a,50,PERFECT CUSTOMER SERVICE! ,"I was really unlucky today and missed my flight to Germany due to a delayed airport-bus (Michigan Flyer) caused by heavy snow...Since I couldn't reach somebody at the customer hotline of Delta airline I asked directly at the counter for help and told them about my situation.Tiffany was really (!) helpful and kind. She called somebody and after 5 minutes, she offered me to take the next flight without additional charges! I couldn't believe it and had tears of joy!Thank you TIFFANY from Delta Airlines!"
Date of travel: October 2019,20,Comfort Plus was not comfortable at all - save your money,"After retiring and finally deciding to take the long journey to China, we chose Delta' comfort plus seating to make the journey more enjoyable.  Delta changed our flights at the last minute and separated me and my husband on the 14 hour flight. Also they sat us in bulk head seats which did not allow you to raise the arm for more comfort.  In one leg of the trip, I couldn't fit in the seat and had to be relocated to row 46.  This is not what I paid for.Furthermore, the travel attendants were rude and cranky. Could they all be having a bad day?Next time I will chose a different airline and get more information in regards to their definition of comfort plus."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Nice short flight,"I liked the premium economy class. There was extra leg room and only 2 persons per row.The snacks weren't great, but it was a short flight and I shouldn't be eating junk food anyway. Bring your own water bottle, fill it up in the terminal, and you'll have plenty of water to stay hydrated."
Date of travel: September 2019,30,Night  flight,Delta has made the seats very cramped. For  an eight hour flight it is difficult. The food is fine and everyone is very nice to you. Helpful  and  very kind.. flight was also on time.
Date of travel: November 2019,10,Detroit airport  delay,"Let's have everyone sit on a plane for 3 hours... no we cant offload, no you cant stand up...I understand weather delays  but that was ridiculous"
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Long and uncomfortable,"We actually flew in Economy Comfort but that category was not an option in the Class of Service list. Twelve hours is a long time to spend in an airplane, but that's the distance from Tel Aviv to NYC and there's not much you can do about it if you want the non-stop option. But why does it have to be sooooo uncomfortable? The whole sardine-can experience on these flights is really depressing and highlights the avaricious profit focus airlines have today. (Hey, it's okay to make money, but when do you stop making passengers uncomfortable?) Legroom in Economy Comfort is a tad better than straight economy, but hardly an ""aaah!"" relief. Food? OMG, Delta food is awful, really it is. In some cases it's unidentifiable and inedible. Frequently it's still frozen when served. (The man sitting in front of me complained to the cabin attendant that our dinner was the worst airline meal he ever had. I could've echoed that sentiment.) Bottom line: bring your own food. Good things: Cabin attendants were all nice and attentive as they always are, flight was on time, entertainment system choices were acceptable. But oh that sardine effect. And don't get me started on the toilets; they need a maintenance crew on board. With mops."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,A two leg trip to D.C. Reagan Airport...really decent!,"A 6 a.m. flight from Eugene, Oregon via a change of plane in Salt Lake City was convenient and virtually incident free! Security was thorough, easy, and hassle free.Our visit to our nations capital was as smooth as can be...getting at Sweet Field (Eugene) was also effortless. We'll do this one again."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,"I like Delta because you know that you always have a seat. I paid for the WiFi to do work, connection and the speed.","Good flight, airline was on time.  Service was good and the staff was friendly.  I asked for extra snacks and it was no problem. I like the choice of movies on the plane. Seat little tight, not as much leg room as SW."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Germany,I had a very wonderful experience with DELTA airlines.   I was treated with lots of love and extra care.  I was served in a plate.....(NOT on a box).I was able to request additional drinks...(free of charge).   Anything i requested was perfectly served professionaly.Delta turned into a real-wonderful treat.   I will recommend this airline to all my friends.Thank you so much Delta for this lovely chcange.I will fly to all my destinies.........(Europe)Alexander Lasso
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Best flight ever,This was the most comfortable long haul flight I have been on. Plenty of leg room and comfortable seats.
Date of travel: November 2019,10,In August this year I visited your site and booked flights from Edinburgh to Orlando return journey with opodo.,"The original booking showed four First/Business class flights. Now I find that the reservation for two passengers has been changed.  The Orlando to JFK on November 30, has been downgraded to premium economy.I am finding it difficulty to fin suitable seats for other parts of the journey.  Delta insists that the change on the Mco to jfk secondment was changed by Opodo."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Excellent!,It has been one of the best transoceanic trips that I ever had. Staff very kind and the food was great.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Birthday trip to Billy Joel,"Take your headphones! I watched two good movies flying up and two flying back. When you first get on the plane, check how long the movies last so you don’t get caught without the ending. I had to fast forward."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Pampered all the way,"Plenty of legroom, huge comfortable seats, friendly and attentive service, great food with pre-selection and I do mean great, on time departures & arrivals, I love Delta!"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Great Service with Only Flight Attendant,Service at the counter and boarding was good and the team was polite. We only had one flight attendant and she did a very nice job of supporting a nearly full aircraft. She was friendly and courteous and worked hard to get everything done on this short flight.
Date of travel: September 2019,50,It is the best,"It was the best flight I have ever been. A friend of mine recommended Delta airlines and I booked it. It was great. They fly you on time; really good customer service; very comfortable airplanes; and on and on. Since then, Delta is my airlines to travel anywhere in the U.S."
n/a,50,One Of The Best 1st Class in The Business For USA airline,"I have flown Delta One, maybe 8x and it has been very consistent at being great. The moment you board the FA and even Captain are chatting it up with you. The seat is a full flat bed with most room you will get on a 777. The presentations or meals,snacks,drinks etcc is fantastic.  The service is always attentive,  and as good as any Michelin star restaurant,  maybe better! I always choose a top notch scotch, sometimes I ask 2x if they have Macallan Scotch in the back, which they always seem to find. Lol I always appreciate the Tumi flight kit too."
Date of travel: November 2019,10,An embarrassment to the United Statea,Delta airlines in Atlanta is an embarrassment to the US. The gate agents and everyone I encountered during 2 separate trips were rude and not helpful. The way they treated international travelers was embarrassing and the way my elderly mother and other passengers needing assistance was disgusting. I will do everything I can to NEVER fly delta through Atlanta again.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Another Nice Flight on Delta.....,"My wife and I recently flew to Atlanta for our connecting flight to San Antonio. Our flight was delayed due to weather in Atlanta for a few minutes but we still made it there almost on time.On board the crew was very friendly and polite....Drinks and snacks were served and we also had a newer plane that had a tv screen on each seatback....That makes for a much better flight. However, I don't understand why the shorter of our two flights had tv screens and the longer one did not...Go figure.Still it was a great flight and both of our flights to San Antonio were good."
Date of travel: November 2019,20,Unsatisfactory Overseas Flight,"We recently flew Delta Airlines from Madrid to Atlanta.  We booked economy class tickets and upgraded to Comfort class.  The flight was 10 hours long.  We were not at all happy with Delta Comfort.  It didn’t seem like much of an upgrade from economy class for the extra we paid. The plane was an older model.  With quick turnarounds these days to keep the planes on schedule, the planes are not properly cleaned. The seating area was dirty.  Our tray tables were both broken.  The bathrooms smelled of urine.  My very small video screen did not work.  I notified the flight attendant and they tried three times to reset it.  It still did not work.  To be on a 10 hour flight with no video entertainment to pass the time was unacceptable.  The flight attendant said there was no empty seats on the plane to move me to.  She promised to compensate me with skymiles and vouchers.  I never received anything.  I would not recommend this flight or upgrade.  Next time I book an overseas flight, I will make sure it is a new model plane and probably not a Delta flight.  I think you are treated much better on foreign airlines."
Date of travel: July 2019,30,"OK, but could improve","I enjoyed the service a lot. The food was great for a long haul flight. However, they need to manage their toilets a bit because it is sometimes dirty."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Thank you for flying Delta!,"In my 1st trip to Aruba, I flew on 2 airlines. I departed NY flying Delta & returned on JetBlue. The Delta flight was excellent. Roomy seats, tv screens working well with lots of selections, superior flight attendant service, smooth flight AND we arrived early!! Thank you Delta Airlines! I can’t say the same for JetBlue."
Date of travel: November 2019,10,Dont waste your money (aka Delta sucks),"Traveled to UK from St. Louis and return last week in Delta Comfort class. What a waste of money!  Service was okay, food was stone cold, and the ""free drinks"" included in the price was only one and that was with dinner.  I couldn't even get a second cup of coffee! The flight back was about the same. Delta has added a cocktail to their economy service and menus.  Still couldnt get a second cup coffee.  The flight staff was grumpy and I was reprimanded for trying to didpose of my menu before the last snack, the male flight attendant even pulled out the from the rubbish and handed it back. I will save the additional $500 and suffer the crap flight in cattle class. Now if you want a better class of service fly premium economy fly BA or Virgin."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,great flight,A great smooth flight.  We had great weather leaving Rome so great views of islands and Alps.  Looked the Premium economy for extra room
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Getting to Memphis for a short vacation,"We were boarded early due to my wife and my physical challenge. Thank you to the gate agent. Seats were what we expected. Flight left on time and arrived 10 minutes early. Only problem I had was that I stored an Amazon Kindle in the storage bag on the seat in front of me and forgot to take it with me. On arrival at hotel I realized the error and tried to call the airline ""Lost and Found"". Couldn't find a number that worked. Only went to Atlanta and I wanted Memphis. ThenI got lucky anther passenger had the same seat on a return flight to MSP and he would hold in MSP until we returned. He did and I collected."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,"Coming home, on time and with minimum delays","It was an early morning departure, about 7:30 AM with an interchange in Detroit. Both flights left and arrived on time, or perhaps a few moments early. My wife and I both have physical challenges and the gate agents enabled us to enter the plane and get to our seats with an early access. Thank you to the gate agents. In flight service was pleasant and timely. Seats were crowded, but in these days we expect that. Planes were clean and well maintained. No surprises of the negative variety."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Nice relaxed flight between NYC and Milan,"These are good flights on Airbus 330-300s. I believe these were originally Northwest Airlines' planes, and I took them many times between Minneapolis and Honolulu. This is a quiet flight, with a good number of empty seats, and excellent flight attendants. Did two round trips about two weeks apart and ran into some of the same folks."
Date of travel: November 2019,10,Zero Legroom,"Booked 2 round trip tickets from NY JFK to Paris CDG on 32,000 points per ticket.  Due to passport issue had to postpone departure date by two days. Spoke to supervisor who advised me that new ticket would be 106,000 points or $1,250 per ticket. I advised supervisor that I wasn’t interested. I waited an hour and called Delta again. This time I spoke to a different supervisor who offered to honor the points that I originally paid for the tickets (32,000) plus a $150 fee per ticket. There’s absolutely no reason why I should have gotten two such different offers from two Delta supervisors.  Add a totally uncomfortable flight due to zero legroom and you have an unhappy passenger."
Date of travel: June 2019,50,Always Fly Delta,Delta Airlines took care of all of our needs to and from our destination. The Sky Club was awesome and staff made us smile!
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Delta mix up,So we had a connecting flight and i checked in on line. When we were due to board they had assigned seats that my 13 year old child was not allowed to be sat in. We should have been priority boarding but by the time the poor staff had shuffled everyone's seats to accommodate us we ended up being separated as a family. The staff member did make sure my child was sat with myself so i was not too bothered about the disruption. We were half way through the short flight before i realised we were sat in the correct class of seats and that i did indeed have a screen and access to entertainment during our flight.  I was not the only passenger on my whole row who thought that we did not have this facility as it was tucked away under the seat so it did cause some amusement to 6 of us when we realised where everything was placed despite only having 30 mins prior to landing but we all made good use of it. Staff were helpful and polite.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Great Flight,Service was exceptional From checking into picking the baggage up at the end of the flight. The check  in  was effortless. Small line no problem at all. I’ll bag was waiting for us at the baggage claim area at the end of the flight.
Date of travel: October 2019,10,Aggressive Flight Attendant,"Worst flight experience ever!Flight DL 272, 10/31 JFK to LISFirstly, the Delta app compared to other airlines is more complicated to navigate and the check in page is very small and hard to read. At the airport, seats were only allocated at the gate and then changed again when we were boarding. Other airlines allocate seats at check in, obviously at Delta that’s not the case, but then why do you change the seats again 15 minutes after they were allocated at the gate?!When we were boarding the plane no one told us that there is no space for our carry on luggage. When we arrived at our seats in row 43, we were told by a flight attendant, named Antonio, that there is no room for our carry on and we have to go back to the front of the plane. How do you go to the front when there are people boarding the plane? Impossible, right? Antonio didn’t understand that and was shouting at us that we should move aside and make space for people trying to get to their seats. Standing there in the middle of the aisle with our luggage, in between passengers trying to squeeze through, I told him that this was a joke as they should have told us at the door that there is no space for the luggage. Antonio however answered in a very aggressive way to step aside and be patient. Should a flight attendant not be more professional than that? Is this not an everyday situation for them?Luckily the maitre de cabin was more professional than Antonio and found a solution. Well, finally seated, we were informed that they don’t have enough headphones for economy class. My first time with Delta and most likely also my last. I travel quite a lot for work and after this flight I instructed my assistant to avoid Delta whenever possible.I submitted this feedback to Delta, but of course in line with their poor service, no one has ever replied."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Cincinnati to Amsterdam,"The flight was comfortable, we had enough seat and knee space for normal sized people in 2-4-2 configuration. Meals were very good, tasty. No snacks offered. Free alcohol on international, even basic economy."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Internal Flight,Flew the second leg of a flight from Manchester UK to Orlando via Delta. Seats are comorftable although the flight is generally very busy so you can find your party separated seat-wise.Drinks service and films available although you will need to take your own headphones.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Non-eventful pair of flights,"While I usually fly Southwest, I got a good deal on Delta Vacations for a convention I went to this past Friday. Both flights were on Boeing 717 aircraft (former AirTran), which made for a smooth ride overall. Flights left on time and were early both ways (incoming was 17 minutes early, returning flight 5 minutes early). Service from ground and plane crew was good, economy seating was fine (even had overhead space for my carry-on). Not a fan of Delta's boarding procedures (three tiers before my zone was called) or their pay-to-use WiFi though. I did get queasy upon final approach back to Raleigh, but I blame that on the rough air than any fault of the pilots."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Crew Professionally Managed a Crowded Flight,"This was a very crowded flight and the crew managed it easily. There were no issues on this flight and Delta did a fine job. As always, leg room is an issue but there is nothing to do about that issue."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,"Nice, Newer Aircraft and Proffesional Staff","This flight used a newer aircraft and there was just a bit more legroom At 6'5"", every little bit helps. The crew was friendly and professional and there were no issues at all on this flight."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,"Nice Flight, On Time, Friendly Staff",Just as expected form a good airline. The flight was on time and the staff was professional and efficient. No issues at all on this flight.
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Cheerful service makes for a pleasant trip(s),"On 30 September this year, I had occasion to fly to NY from LA with Delta. The ground staff and particularly the air crew could not have been friendlier or more helpful. As a bonus, the flight left on time and arrived early. Just to prove it wasn't a fluke, on the return journey (Nov 2), the same high standard was provided. I highly recommend this airline."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,delta airlines,"the crew and staff were very accommidating, friendly as cheerful without heitation to help or answer questions"
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Excellent Flight,"Delta flight 6032 from Pittsburgh to Boston on Wednesday, November 6 was easy and a pleasure. The flIght used a full size plane rather than a regional jet which is often the case for short haul flight on Regional Carrier. Additionally, I assume, due to the mid-week, mid-day schedule the flight had many empty seats and was able to move to seat without another passenger next to me. Flight Attendant was great."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,"Day flight , comfortable, especially like “comfort plus”","Comfortable, quiet, attentive crew on Sunday, Nov. , easy boarding and deplaning process. Could skip the breakfast offering, hot croissant, mushy. The best part was the chocolate ice cream!"
Date of travel: October 2019,20,Not again,I took delta flight to and from Amsterdam to the houston. The business class seats were adequate but uncomfortable. I had to cross over someone everytime I went to the bathroom. It didnt help that the bathrooms were so small and badly maintained. I guess what finally made it worse was ths inbuilt entertainment that had old movies and old music. I thought I was back in the 1970s again
Date of travel: October 2019,50,TAMPA TO JFK,"Had another good experience with Delta. Started at the Tampa Sky Club. Located on the second floor with views of the Delta concourse. Friendly staff and just a great place to relax before my flight. The flight to JFK was on time boarding and I was met at the plane with a smile from the flight attendant. Comfortable seat with a waiting bottle of water. Lunch was very good, little hamburger sliders. Great flight all the way with an excellent crew."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,"Delta has stepped up their game, If you haven't flown Delta in a while you should.","Nice newer aircraft, comfortable seating.  Personal infotainment screens with complimentary live TV Movies & Games.   Combine that with refreshment  and you have a party."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great job.,We needed to get to my mother in law quickly. Our flights to and from went well. The trip to and from was smooth and they communicated with us(passengers). I would use Delta's services in the future.
Date of travel: April 2019,40,"Courteous staff, stewards and stewardesses and Ticket counter.","From the time upon coming to stop at the ticket counter until we landed and disembarked, every member of the personnel was courteous and very attentive and accommodating. Considering how many passengers there were and the constant need from all passengers the personnel maintained a calm and professional demeanor at all times."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,I wish you could upgrade with miles more easily,"Delta has two ways of upgrading with miles, one where they show you the miles needed while buying the tickets, and one where you buy (with miles) upgrade vouchers that have restrictions. Booking the flight, it seemed to be cheaper to pay all dollars than a mix of dollars and miles. There never seems to be a good chance to use miles with Delta; I wish their system were a bit more predictable with how many miles are needed to upgrade.They have a good selection of entertainment, but resolution of their screen is below expectations. When viewing on my phone, they showed a version meant for analog TV, with the sides chopped off. So neither is great.Flight attendant came by often to offer me drinks; that's good service.I liked the food both ways, and both flights were on time."
Date of travel: March 2019,40,Delta's First Class was good,The flight departed on time and no issues with check in and boarding. It was a B767-400 ER. The first class which I traveled was good. The duvet pillows the headset was OK. Being first class had good leg room Other than that it was a pretty average and decent experience. The food and wine they served for this short flight was average for a first class. Flight attendants were courteous. The seat had a good amount of width and AC power outlets were available underneath.
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Vacation package,"I booked my vacation package through the Delta website. I used points to upgrade my seat to have priority seating along with extra leg room and designated overhead luggage space. My only issue was with the casino that I chose which was the Flamingo which for the cost was not the place for me, they should be booking to something other than ""Fab"" rooms because they are not Fabulous at all. I was also able to book my transport from the airport in Vegas to Casino and back, trip there after my flight driver was not very pleasant but the driver from the Casino to the airport was great, gave us information about different areas while she was driving us to the airport."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,"Delta's Economy Plus - step-up from economy, but not near business-class","Many employers are economizing on international travel and requiring employees to fly coach. Economy Plus (Premium Economy) has emerged as a compromise between frugal employers employees. I recently flew Delta's Premium economy. While it doesn't provide the same comforts as a business class, it is a bit of an upgrade over economy with a few frills:- Better leg-room- Amenity kit- Priority checkin, boarding and baggage tag- 'Better' presentation of airline food"
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Poor inflight entertainment but good service,"We have flown Delta airways for a total of 5 legs within a short span of two weeks. The air stewardesses were courteous and helpful at all times. However, am truly disappointed that 3 out of the 5 legs that I flew, the inflight entertainment (TV) were screwed. I am not able to view any movies at all as the screen hang all the time. The air stewardesses offered to reset it a few times, still, it did not work. I hope the airline will do a good maintenance on this. Otherwise, flight more than five hours without inflight entertainment were terrible."
Date of travel: September 2019,10,Botched Handicap Service,"Do NOT trust or depend on this airline if you need wheelchair assistance. One way they left us standed , the employee did not know what she was doing, she was slow & distracted & we almost missed the flight.They don't really care because they just book you on the next one. The plane landed on the tarmac & no one helped on the stairs of the transit bus. Return flight gate was changed x 3 & then cancelled. They had someone take us to rebook but they gave us no vouchers & Air Canada would not honour the meal on the flight & they were not helpul. Never again."
Date of travel: November 2019,10,Never been on such a dirty plane...,"The galley was filthy.  It did not smell clean.  The flight attendant were disheveled. The carts they used in the aisles looked like they had never been cleaned.The bathrooms keep getting smaller, and it you weigh over 250 pounds, there might not be enough room to turn around.The only positive is that the overhead bins were large."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,had to go to NYC,"flew to LGA with a stop in Durham, NC of all places.  It's a nice airport.  Clean, easy to navigate though very long. Our arrival gate was on one end and or departure gate on the other.  There is a shuttle train up above that you can access on either end or in the middle.  Since we did not know about it, we accessed it in the middle."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Good flight,As usual when flying Delta in my experience was excellent customer service and on time service.  My biggest desire is to fly non-stop and Delta provides the most locations with non-stop service out of MSP since it is one of their main hubs.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,The only airline that gets in early,Prefer Delta because they are rarely late and often get in early.  Snacks not as good as they used to be because of peanut allergy issues but understand the liability.Thank you Delta for working hard to keep planes on time and for your overall service minded attitude
Date of travel: October 2019,10,DELTA LOST MY BAG,"I have been a Delta platinum member for years and Delta has LOST MY BAG and is not doing anything about it. I arrived at JFK from Accra, retrieved my 3 suitcases and re-checked them in to Tampa only for me to receive only 2bags in Tampa. Customer service has been USELESS on how to handle the situation and no one calls back when they say they will. I ended up having to file a claim and Delta is asking for receipts of all my stuff in the bag-which is ridiculous because how do they expect me to have receipts for items purchased years ago? Did I ask for my bag to be lost? The claims manager Thierno Balde never answers his phone or returns messages. This is so unacceptable and I’ve had enough of Deltas nonsense. I paid almost $3000 for my ticket and my suitcase alone is almost $1000-not to mention all my valuables inside the suitcase which Delta CANNOT pay for. I need my bag back and I will be getting my lawyer to intervene because Delta at this point feels they can be careless and pay me off (which  they cannot because they would give me way less than what everything costs) and get away with it. Not this time. I’M DONE with Delta"
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Best airline I have flown in years.,"I flew on Delta, 2 flights from Fort Lauderdale to Munich via Atlanta. Staff was great as well as entertainment options. The only negative (which is the same for virtually all airlines) is the seat room. I am a small person and I have trouble squeezing in the economy seats. How tall or larger people can take it I have no idea. Overall a good experience."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Always try to fly Delta.,Always try to fly Delta.  Most connections are in Atlanta.  Service was excellent. Premium economy seats are just a little bigger than economy and a little bit more comfortable.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Flight to England,"The service was superb. The catering far better than expected. Only glitch was by the connecting flight by KLM . They were unable to tell me what terminal I was flying into at Heathrow and consequently I was stranded at the wrong terminal until I was able to locate someone to forward a message to my family that I was at terminal 4 rather than terminal 3 as I had been advised at the start of my trip that they thought I was flying into terminal 3 but to check with KLM. The KLM staff were rude , uncooperative and did not arrange for a handicapped service at my destination"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Birthday Adventure,"Started in Las Vegas with domestic Delta flights to Atlanta for my International flight.  Able to pick seats I wanted.  Clearly spelled out in literature and announcements about service during flights.  Bottle of water arrived first, followed by hot cloth for refreshment as service started.  Choice of three meals for dinner service, including Vegan (9 hour overnight flight).  Good food, with a variety of tidbits from cheese slice, crackers, salad, veggies and meat (not on Vegan meal), with something sweet for dessert.  Coffee and variety of drinks accompanied meal.Large video screen for movies, games, audio books, songs or for tracking the flight.  Reading light or attendant call also controlled from screen.  Delta provided headsets for flight as well as comfort pack including earplugs and eye mask.  Pillow and blanket were on seat when I arrived.Lights were dimmed and people watched screens or stretched out for sleep.  No waiting for a restroom that seemed redesigned with smaller counter, but clearly marked cubbyholes for diaper/sickness bags, seat covers, paper towels, etc.  And each use found tidy space (I wipe counter before I leave as well).About 1 1/2 hours before landing, lights were turned on for breakfast service.  A box breakfast that offered sandwiches items like ham/cheese or chicken and included juice, breakfast biscuits, etc.  A chance to get ready to deplane with a little energy and make it to next gate for home.Been a number of years since I flew domestic or internationally.  Delta staff was helpful from checkin (even when I returned to check small backpack that contained Swiss Armt knife), during the flight (I needed a 2nd blanket) and advising me about possible flight bump I volunteered for (but was not needed).An enjoyable travel experience on my trip to celebrate my 67th birthday by trekking in Patagonia!"
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Delta is great for overseas trips!,Professional yet friendly crew. Food was good. Good space for carryon luggage. Crew kept us informed of schedule.
Date of travel: January 2019,50,Excellent,We had the best service from our flight attendances😄.  Had what an illness while in flight.  They were awesome.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,To many lay overs,I fly Delta last September for vacation to Cabo. Great service. Seats were comfortable and plenty of leg room. Entertainment was good lots of movies selection to choose from. My on complaint is there was to many lay overs to get to my destination. I wish Delta had more direct flights to Cabo.
Date of travel: August 2019,40,Satisfying Experience,"We use Delta for many of our vacation flights.   This flight was on time at both ends.  The plane was relatively clean.  I believe there are spots on most airlines that do not get the attention needed like the pockets of the chairs and the tray tables.  If we were not satisfied with Delta, we would choose another airline."
Date of travel: September 2019,50,Delta Air Lines Service,"The service provided by Delta employees, ticket agents to flight crews, was great. The one area that was a little scary was how close the online scheduling in changing planes during the trip especially when the boarding gate are located in different terminals."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Good Non-Stop Service from Boston to JAX,"We had a very nice non-stop flight between Boston Logan and Jacksonville. Service was up to Delta's typical standards with good baggage handling, boarding, etc. We purchased Delta's Comfort Plus seating because an attractive offer. That worked out well--with a first class upgrade on the southbound flight. We're pleased and would be happy to use Delta again for this city pair."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Connecting into Key West,"Connecting thru Atlanta, took the 7am out of MDT with 45 minute layover... Beware - 45 min, if there are any delays, can be too close for comfort despite the first flight in the am.."
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Cancelled Flight,"The flights are always great.  I have no issues with that.  the problem is that I went to the Delta ticket counter at the airport to see about changing my flight to a day earlier.  There was a $430 charge to change my flight.  So, intelligently I said no thanks and went on my merry way.  I indicated that I will stick with my original flight.  I cannot imagine what would cost $430 in order to change a flight!!  I imagine it really costs nothing to change a flight because that is what the lady at the Delta ticket counter did.  She had changed my flight and cancelled my original flight without me knowing.  And when I said no thank you she never changed it back.  So, to my surprise, the next day trying to get on my flight was difficult when their records indicated that I already flew out the previous day.  I did not hand this lady my ID or my credit card to make the change.  She was just supposed to see if we could change a flight.  They did get us on a flight later that day after seven hours in the airport.  Delta also promised me a $200 voucher for my troubles which I have still not received."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,"Easy flight, very kind attendants","Took a short weekend trip to Pittsburgh, using credit that was about to expire, so we flew first class.  The attendants were great, and the flight was very smooth.  Weather was terrible in NYC on our return date, and Delta did a great job letting me know well in advance that the flight would be delayed so I could better plan when to arrive at the airport.  The only reason I'm giving four instead of five stars is that, en route to the airport, Delta texted again to let me know they'd moved UP the delayed departure time, which put me in a bit of a panic, as I assumed once the delay time was sent to me, that that was the new departure time; I didn't expect the plane to then change the time again to depart earlier.  That said, we still made it on the flight and the pilot made up most of the time en route, so, despite a 90 minute delay from the original departure time, we were on the ground only 20 minutes after the originally scheduled arrival time. Good job, Delta!I'm not a big fan of the censored movies (I can decide for myself if I want to hear swear words, Delta), nor of having to watch the provided entertainment on the screen of my own device with no way to recharge my device on the plane, but on a short flight it's a minor quibble.  Again, props to the flight attendants, who were all great, and to Delta making me aware early of the weather delay, so I could spend another hour or so with family before leaving for the airport."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Cancun trip was Great,Booked a trip thru Delta Airlines to Cancun Mexico. Everything was supurb right down to the day trip to Coba. Was great to stick with one business that is able to do everything you need.(cutting out the middle man). Will definitely check into Delta Airlines for my next vacation to see if they can help.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Great when traveling with babies!,"We flew Delta with our 4-month twins, and every staff member we encountered was incredibly kind and helpful! Will definitely be flying with them again...flying with babies isn’t easy and everyone went out of their way to make our lives easier!"
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Vegas to Atlanta - very comfortable,Was lucky with a good economy seat with plenty of legroom (row 26 at the emergency exit) and it was a row 2. Must say staff was extremely polite and customer focused. Must have offered refill of coffee 5x. Love the free Wifi for messaging and live-TV.
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Only way to fly,We left Minneapolis on time and arrived in Atlanta early which was good because our flight to Charleston was to board soon after we landed.  The Charleston flight was only 40 minutes and also arrived early.  This is my usual experience with Delta--arriving earlier than scheduled.  Who can ask for more.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Great Team,"We flew 4 legs with this trip, 2 out and 2 back.  In checking on luggage and curb side check in, my rep arranged a wheel chair for me since I was having some back issues.  There was a delay in taking off as the incoming flight was delayed; and there was some turbulance, but we made up some time and connected with our next flight.  Delta in my opinion has made some good snack changes and loved the Starbucks coffee now served.  We purchased comfort seats and on a flight of this length they provided the room I needed to be in the air over 7 hours and still move on landing!  Staff were accommodating and friendly."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Non-stop from Boston to KC.,Non-stop is definitely the way to go if possible.  Less stress or worry about making the connection.  The flight crew was very professional and friendly.  The flight was smooth and uneventful.  The seats lacked leg room for anyone with long legs.
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Great Customer Service,"Reliable and timely. Mark answered all my questions about the US Customs forms from the call center the night before and emailed me one I had forgotten. Bag picked up at my hotel in London on time and delivered to my office in San Francisco two days later, just as agreed. Easy and at a fair price. Good tracking info along the way. Recommend highly."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Excellent,Delta has always been my airline of choice and will always be at anytime because of their excellent customer service to their customers. They treat their customers as they deserved.
Date of travel: October 2019,10,Poor customer service,"My husband and I applied for a SkyMiles AMEX card. It was in my husband's name. I was flying by myself without my husband even though my husband had made the reservations and paid with the card. I was told I would have to pay the baggage fee. (One of the main reasons we got the card.) I was told I needed to have a card. We immediately ordered an extra card in my name. The next time I flew, I was told I had to pay the baggage fees again. But this time somebody actually took the time to explain that each person had to have their own card in their own name. Unless the person was traveling with you, baggage fees had to be paid. The airline clerk offered to apply for a card in my name. I did that, two weeks later, and 2 days after I rec'd my card. I received a special offer for select SkyMiles members ( directly to me with my #) to earn 70,000 bonus miles to apply. I called to ask if they could adjust my account to receive the extra bonus miles which was 10,000 more than what they were going to give me. They refused. I think it's very poor customer service and short-sightedness on their part as they're the ones who sent me the offer."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,Return trip to New York,This was our third trip together to New York. We had issues checking in at both ends because we bought the extra leg room option through Virgin’s website and therefore  our boarding passes wouldn't print. We weren’t sat together on the way out but were on the way back. The in-flight entertainment was okay but we had a night flight on the way back so didn't use it much. The food was good with plenty of drinks. I got unwell shortly afterwards - people coughing and sneezing everywhere gave the air conditioning plenty of germs to spread around.
Date of travel: August 2019,50,Great Service!,"Service was great, we were on time and Delta really goes above and beyond to make you feel special. The food is decent for airplane food and the seats are comfy."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Everything ended up OK!,"You always think that there will not be a problem with the 5.50am  1st flight out of Buffalo BUT when the plane didn't arrive the night before, eveything  falls apart. It was called a ""delayed flight"" as opposed to ""cancelled"" and a plane finally arrived about 5 hours later to take us to JFK. Even the crew were unaware of the lack of plane! Anyway, the ground staff kept us up to date and coffee and donuts were brought to the gate. Our connection in JFK was missed but we were rebooked on a later flight to Santo Domingo(which was half an hour late leaving). The service on both flights was excellent and our flight attendant on the SDQ leg never stopped working the 1st class cabin during the flight. Very comfortable and clean aircraft and that is why I am giving an ""excellent"" rating to Delta in spite of the huge delay."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Fantastic and Comfortable Airline,"Delta is hands-down my favorite airline! They're generally very kind, upbeat, and accommodating. The pilots always seem positive and we have safe and comfortable take-off and landing. I also appreciate the snack options on the longer flights."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Boston Trotter,"Flying as a spare on a Boeing is a bit weird for me as a Gulfstream fan .Check inn was a bit hilarious ....got a seat due to me being a wheelchair person !Delta then realized that im a healthy Pilot and no wheel chair needed !Crew was fantastic.They are very attentive so full points there.Arrival in Paris was swift and pleasant through border control,TSA can learn lots from here."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Italy round trip,"If you can have a great experience on two 12-hour flights across the water to Italy, I highly recommend Delta Airlines and Air France (their partner in Europe).We flew Delta's Economy Plus to Venice, then hooked up with Air France to Venice. On the return to SF, we flew Paris to Venice. We had great flights with very accommodating and personable service from both Delta and Air France's flight attendants. At the time I booked our flights, I did purchase travel insurance through Allianz Travel (through Delta). My husband's bag, with all of his clothes was stolen on the train, somewhere between Rome and Naples (we believe someone got on the train when it stopped in Naples and snagged his bag. So frustrating as we were in the middle of our trip. I highly recommend trip insurance. Save every receipt and label what purchase you have made, especially since you will want to check your credit card and debit card statements. It was time-consuming to complete the insurance report, however, it was worth it as we were approved for the total amount allowed ($300 each traveler on lost items and $400 for a lost bag). Well worth the money spent on the insurance, etc. Customer service agents by phone are very helpful."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Detroit to Boston,Our flights to and from Boston were awesome...arrived 1/2 hour early and direct flight home on time...all staff courteous and plane very clean.
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Hinterland expectations,"There is virtually no competition from our area to northern California (or for a large number of areas, for that matter) - - - we simply take what we can get. That is Delta. Because there is no competition, fares are very high and the service just adequate. But, let's face it, the flights do take off and the flights do land. The planes themselves are state of the art, but all are furnished with cramped seats that barely recline. The flight attendants are bored, going through the motions tossing out snacks and drinks and making barely intelligible announcements, that is for everything except for services they are hawking on behalf of the airline.Could it be worse? Yes. No service at all."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,On Time when you need it,"We were flying to New York from New Orleans to take a cruise that afternoon. I watched the flight for about a week and it was always on time, so I booked it. We arrived at the airport at 10:20 in the morning and with a 45 minute transit to the pier, we were on board before noon. Well ahead of our 4;00 sailing."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,HONEYMOON TRIP,The flight was very smooth and didn't have any problems with the bags. The workers were very nice and the TV on the seats with complementary head phones made the flight fly by! I would recommend this airline even though they are on the high end. You get what you pay for.
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Delta when I can,"When traveling out of Cincinnati, I definitely prefer Delta. Actually, I prefer Delta generally. They just seem very consistent and they communicate well regarding luggage and flight status."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Very nice crew! Helpful! Seats ok. Entertainment good!,"We had a very pleasant experience with Delta. The crew was helpful and very nice! The entertainment was good! Flying from Zurich is an experience! One I would rather not repeat!! Many long lines showing passports several times. The gate was a long, long trip from the entrance. One should be aware to give yourself plenty of time to get to your flight!!!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,River Cruise 2019,"The Delta check in appeared to be a long wait but went very quickly once in the que. Several Delta personnel were on hand to help travelers negotiate the self-service luggage check in. Going through Amsterdam TSA was pretty easy too even though we missed the TSA Pre line...still plenty early for finding our gate and boarding. We had a connection through JFK in New York and that process - customs, baggage re-check and TSA Pre went smooth and very quick! We were only in line a total of 30 minutes for everything! On top of that our flight pushed out of the gate 20 minutes early and we landed 30 minutes early back in Indy! A great treat for tired senior citizens!"
Date of travel: October 2019,40,"good flight, bad ground staff","I arrived at the airport in lots of time, having already checked in online.  I wasn't concerned however when I printed my boarding pass, the machine prompted that the flight was overbooked and they were looking for volunteers to take a later flight.  I had a long layover in MSP so I might have delayed however I wanted to be sure I would still arrive home at the same time.  I wanted to ask when dropping off my bag.  I was in line for over 45 minutes.  There was 1 staff member, their bag drop conveyor was not working and they kept taking priority customers.  I was still in line when boarding of my flight had started.  Other passengers were upset, like I was and started to become vocal and we were still not taken any quicker.  When I finally did get to the counter, I was informed that there was lots of time to get there.  I completely forgot about volunteering since I was already so late.  I made it to my gate just in time for my boarding zone.  That was probably the worst checking in experience I've ever had and I travel at least 5 times a year.  The flight  arrived early, but the plane was not fully cleaned...there was a used tissue in the pocket in front of me (a pet peeve of mine)."
Date of travel: November 2019,50,SLC - PDX,Comfortable travel.  Delta provides excellent service between Salt Lake City and Portland.  Providing many more flights than other carriers allows business travelers flexible choices.  First Class service is always a comfortable option with a variety of drinks and snacks.  Friendly flight attendants assist with travel questions and connections.  Always accommodating when flight schedules are disrupted.
Date of travel: February 2019,50,I Love Delta,I am limited in airlines that fly from Northern Michigan unless I drive 5 hours to Detroit. Delta is one that serves many of my closer airports. I find their seats much more comfortable then other airlines. The food is definitely better. All of the crew is wonderful. I only wish that with pre-boarding they would limit the number of family members that accompany a person for this. I also appreciate the pre-flight drink in First Class.
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Delta's on time more than Most!,I always fly Delta now. It is the most consistent best Value in the Air. I never have a problem with Ticketing or late flights and there People are the best.
Date of travel: October 2019,30,Narrowest seats ever,"The flight was endless - over 17 hours - and the seats were so narrow that even as a fairly thin person I had to keep my arms pressed tight against my body the whole trip.  The food was mediocre though that wasn’t unexpected and the crew wasn’t very friendly.  The aisles also seemed especially narrow which made it difficult to take any walks during the flight.  Also, the movie selection was poor so I didn’t even have that as a distraction."
Date of travel: October 2019,20,"""First Class"", but decidedly second rate","There was a time when a long-haul (6+ hours) flights made being in first class a pleasure; an experience worth paying for.  The food was wonderful, the creature comforts delightful, and the service attentive to a fault.  You could take a long nap.  Oh, wait.  That time is today!  Except not on Delta, and not on Delta's flight 2488 between Boston and San Francisco.  Our first-class experience was decidedly second rate, and most certainly not worth the money.  The odd thing is, Delta knows how to deliver that pleasurable experience.  Earlier this year we flew Delta One (nominally Business Class) to London from Boston, and it was perfection.Here's what was wrong:  Pre-flight:  If you have the right kind of credit card, you can have a courtesy entry to the Delta Sky Lounge even though you are flying on a $220 round-trip ticket.  If you are flying Delta One, you have a courtesy entry.  But a first class ticket gets you a polite but firm rebuff.  What sense does that make?Boarding: First class gets you Sky Priority, which is good getting on the plane.  But with the entry portico located back around row 15, getting off means it is ten minutes before you're off the plane.  (Yes, I know that's being picky)The seat: it barely reclined - perhaps 20 degrees, perhaps less.  Yes, it was wider than coach, but by maybe three inches.  The seat pitch was decidedly less than in Delta One.The food: on the way out, a breakfast of some kind of lukewarm spinach quiche, an ice-cold bagel, and mixed fruit.  On the way back, a choice of lukewarm vegetarian lasagna or cold salmon and brussels sprouts.  I passed up both choices and asked for the corned beef sandwich being served in coach.  In short, the food was abysmal.The service:  Considering what the crew had to work with, it was the lone bright spot in an otherwise one-star experience.  The flight attendants were both professional and charming, but they spent an inordinate amount of time apologizing for the lack of things."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Mixed customer service experience,"The staff onboard the aircraft was great. However, I had difficulty getting through on the phone when I needed to change my return date. Once getting through, the customer service wasn’t very helpful in my situation. I’ve noticed consistently good flights with friendly staff but sub par experiences owner the phone."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Flight to California,"I try to always fly Delta because I know that it will be a good experience.  Delta allowed me to board early because I have some back problems and it is difficult for me to get to my seat and put my carry on luggage in the overhead bin.  This allowed me to do this without holding up other passengers.  The flight itself was smooth and without incident.  My only complaint is that they only brought drinks through one time.  Usually on a flight this long they come through two times.  This is a minor complaint.  All in all, it was a good flight!"
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Went well,"The flight itself was fine, we were ahead of schedule both ways.  Flight attendants were friendly and patient with me.  I am disabled and slow and was allowed to board the plane first as to give me time to stow gear and sit down in the right seat.I will consider Delta in the future.  Normally I fly Southwest and enjoy it also for the price."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Great airline that gets you where you need to be and treats you right!,"Alway seem to have a great flight with this company.  Because we use it so much we take advantage of their Sky Miles program. Latest flight was a quick one to Atlanta, GA ...NO DELAYS !"
Date of travel: October 2019,10,Worst airline,"Where can I start; old airplanes, filthy toilets, rude staff, uncomfortable seats, air-conditioning that targets Ur head for freezing purpose, constant delays up till 5 hours on way back, nothing good about this airline with all due respect .."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Confirming excellence,"Same seat 1A, two different flys , Washington DC to Atlanta and Atlanta to San Francisco. Same high  standard in service."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Delta always a fair experience,"The kindness os all Delta’s crew and attendants is a plus. Excelent inflight internet , clean cabin and comfortable seat."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Pleasantly pleased,"Delta to Heathrow, chunnel to Paris and Delta home used some miles plus $ 750 round trip for two.Food more interesting than Air France, service fine, on time departures and arrivals is all one can hope for... n’est pas?"
Date of travel: October 2019,10,Not a good experience,"I used to think highly of delta until on our flight home, my kids and I were not seated together. I went to the desk to ask if there was anything that could be done. It took two seconds for the lady to look at her computer and then say “There’s nothing I can do” so my kids (who were 6 and 7) had to sit next to a stranger (at least they were sitting next to each other). I was not pleased at all. Very disappointed in the fact that the lady didn’t even try to get us seated together."
Date of travel: September 2019,40,Usually Ontime,"Comfort Class is worth the few extra $$ if your flight is over a couple of hours, or you have had a long day !!"
Date of travel: December 2018,50,Comfortable ride,Delta no longer flies from Barbados.  Wish we could have it again.  It was a really great flying experience.  I travelled on Delta Air Lines about 4 years ago but your survey only allows for travel from December 2018. So i have listed December 2018 in order to submit the survey.  hope it works.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,On time no issues.,"Flights are On time with no issues; as a monthly traveler, I look to DAL as my go-to airline leader."
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Holiday Flight,"With extra leg room this flight was very comfortable. The service on the flight was good, but the quality of the food was only average."
Date of travel: October 2019,10,i’ll never fly again,I booked a last minute flight.  i have never and would never fly economy again.  my knees barely fit in the seat on the second leg of the trip.  What a disgrace that the airlines are allowed to seat people as though they are cattle.  I’m sure all the airlines are the same.  From now on i’ll stay home or drive
Date of travel: October 2019,40,Family trip,"Flight was fine, but when we boarded someone was in one of our seats.  The flight attendant did not pay attention to what we were telling him.  We had to repeat the issue 3 times before he finally asked the last her seat number.  She was very nice and moved to the correct seat."
Date of travel: October 2019,30,First International Flight with Delta,"This was our first International Flight with Delta as we flew from Seattle to Vancouver.  Lots of security and immigration checks, it was ridiculous how many times we had to have documents checked.  Flight on time, arrival was a long way to baggage.  Lots of immigration kiosks in the arrival area.  Arrival area was spacious and comfortable. It was just a hop and a skip, but comfortable air travel on this Delta flight"
Date of travel: June 2019,40,family trip,"all the staff from this airline are very profesional from the pilot  ticket,  counter, to fly attendants , I will travel this airline again"
Date of travel: September 2019,40,short trip CVG to EWR,Short trip on a Delta commuter to Newark.Left on time and got there a little early for a change.Service was good and friendly
Date of travel: November 2019,10,First Class Terror - stay away!!,"I’m currently on a business trip and decided to fly first class. NOT WORTH IT! Instead, they served us dirty, old, moldy cups. I brought this up to the flight attendant and she said, “I’m not the dishwasher around here!” I literally wanted to puke. There’s seriously stains and MOLD on the rim of the cup. Unacceptable!!!I also asked for a blanket and the flight attendant said, ‘ok, I’ll try” 2 hours goes by, no blanket still. NOT WORTH THE MONEY. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND AIRLINE."
Date of travel: November 2019,30,Okay,"I wouldn't do it again, I prefer a direct flight to Holland. The service was okay, boarding was chaotic."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Great airline,"Too often airlines get a bad rap.  However, whenever I fly Delta I find the service excellent and flight attendants very accommodating.  The cabin was clean and the flight smooth.  More airlines should pattern their customer service after Delta’s."
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Great flight,"Great  Flight at a fair price with good customer service, UNKLIKE other air lines that want to charge for everything, I will Fly Delte again Gladly !!!"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Although this was my worse flight. Delta rock,"I have Used Delta for many many many years! I always have a great booming experience...however not so much this time! Although the f flight was great...I experienced a seating issue! I booked our (spouse and ) flight in April..,travel date Oct! We didn’t get seat assignments until day before flight..,and we were separated! I was not happy with this..I email customer services but have not heard a response til this day! It was annoying to sit apart from my spouse! Ps..I tried to choose my seat at booking but was not allowedAlso..when booking it’s appears when you book early...all parties are place in the back of plane"
Date of travel: October 2019,50,"Comfortable Seats, professional service at a fair price",This was a four-plus hour flight and the free inflight entertainment definitely made the time pass more quickly. Flight attendants came through the cabin frequently enough to provide service but not so much as to disturb sleep or entertainment. Nice assortment of inflight snacks and beverages.
Date of travel: October 2019,50,Great flights,"I flew with Delta last month and had a great experience. All staff was super friendly, professes were streamlined and the plane was clean and comfortable. Would fly Delta again."
Date of travel: November 2019,40,Solid domestic economy experience,"COS-ATL-DFW. Both legs departed and arrived on time. Decent seat size, good in-flight entertainment, good food/snack selection. Wifi was erratic. I'm glad that I shifted my business from American to Delta."
