This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

data <- read.csv("/Path/months.csv")

data2 <- data %>%
  mutate(Month = factor(Month, levels = month.name[month.name %in% unique(Month)]))

  plot <- ggplot(data2, aes(x = Month, y = Avg_Sent_Score)) +
  geom_bar(stat='identity', fill='#693ead') +
    theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=60,hjust=1,vjust=0.5))
                



plot
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
