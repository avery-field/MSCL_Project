0.7106,2021-08-01,2021-08-01,10.0,Absolute worst flight experience by far,"They overbook their flights, ask people to accept giftcards for a later flight as well as asking for people to check more bags since they didnt have enough space. Maybe dont sell me the tickets that you dont have the space for????? Anyway, i decided to help them out and checked 2 of my bags that would have been carry-ons(free of charge). 180 people boarding takes time. 5 planes on the tarmac takes time. 180 people deplaning takes time. I dont work for the airlines, but dont they know their own schedules??? As we were landing, a flight attendant called out connecting flights to inform the passengers of their ""time crunch"". The first 3 or 4 connecting cities left in less that 10 minutes. The door wasnt even open yet. Another 5 down the list i finally hear mine called out along with the gate ""you have 27 minutes"". 10 minutes later we finally were able to step off of the plane. Boarding ends 15min before departure...Regardless, we sprinted through 2 terminals to arrive, covered in sweat, at the gate we were given(was not on departure screen for some reason...?) Just to find out the attendant gave us the wrong gate, and our plane had already left.(explains the screen) our bags were on that plane. I went to customer service, who was not at all thrilled to help me. They told me to call the 24/7 service number. Like arent they there to help me in person???? The soonest flight they could put me on was 6 hours later. I went over to southwest to ask for seat but with delta refusing any non-voucher reimbursement, i was stuck with the 11 pm departure as opposed to my original 530pm arrival time. With nothing but the clothes on my back. Every customer service member i spoke to gave me another number to call, and the last one had me on hold for over an hour, luckily i had the time. Overall just absolutely terrible time management, employess working the gate have zero sense of urgency, but the attendants and pilots seemed genuinely apologetic about the situation even though it was out of their control. I would rather drive cross country in a Neon than fly with them again.","{'neg': 0.046, 'neu': 0.885, 'pos': 0.069, 'compound': 0.7106}",0.7106

Arrived at the airport 2 hours before flight and spent that entire time waiting at their ticketing counter so that we missed both of our flights. Shocked they have survived as a business and hope they do not continue to. Choosing to fly with them was the biggest mistake I’ve made in years.

They canceled the flight and put us in economy on another flight and would not refund the difference.  They said it was booked through Expedia so we should call them.  Expedia rightly pointed out that Delta canceled the flight and was obligated to give us our money back or provide us with first class seats.  Neither happened and we flew economy after paying for first class.  I contacted them afterwards and they basically don't care.Ironically we finally made it on first class on our return flight and it was extremely underwhelming.  The seats are small and old and were very dirty (amazing during the times of covid).  At best it felt like flying premium economy.  Don't ever fly first class on Delta since it's not worth the money.  For that matter, just pick another airline.

I was anxious to fly home to my asthmatic, diabetic mother during COVID and heard Delta was the best so I booked my ticket with them. I was beyond impressed. The minute you walked on the plane you could tell it was clean, refreshed, and sanitized. They boarded only ten people at a time, sat people in every other row, and ensured no one reserved the seat next to you to maintain distance. Everyone, including flight attendants and passengers, wore masks the whole time, they handed out snacks in pre-packaged baggies, and had sanitizing wipes available on the plane.

But when I went to the customer service desk they talked to me like I was a dog or a three-year-old. It was absolutely no compassion very little information an attitude of impatience and actually at one point nastiness in their tone of voice and like a mother talking to the child will go get something to eat and just calm down. Seriously I'm a 70 year old doctor and I'm trying to solve the problem that was caused by the airline's? And this is how you handle it. And by the way yes they had a small group of people lined up maybe 15 or 20 and at one point about eight of them left because they figured something out themselves. So it wasn't like they were mobbed and about 10 minutes later when I walked by again they were completely quiet and they weren't working they were just hanging out. So I don't see any reason for people who are supposed to be hired to solve problems for the consumer to be acting this way. I have never gone out of my way to write a complaint like this but this deserves attention because they need to train their people. If you're hired for customer service and to solve problems we need the personality to do it as well as the skill set,"{'neg': 0.107, 'neu': 0.764, 'pos': 0.129, 'compound': 0.7165}",0.7165

0.7181,2021-05-01,2021-05-01,20.0,Flight attendants were rude and unhelpful.  Plane was dirty.,"Flying with kids is a challenge.  Its even more of a challenge when an airline does not allow you to pick seats to keep your kids with you.  When we were boarding we were attempting to figure out how to be near our children.  Instead of helping, Riki, the flight attendant asked ""what are you doing?"" I explained to her that we didn't want the kids sitting alone so we were trying to figure it out.  She responded ""Well, can you figure it out, we'd like to leave on time.""  It would have been nice to have the flight attendants help with that.    A few things were wrong with this, there were still passengers behind us boarding the plane.  We were clear in the back so we weren't holding up those passengers.  She didn't attempt to help us in any way.  While I was working on that some passengers were struggling to put their luggage into overhead bins, the attendants made no attempt to help them so I helped them which took even longer.There was a dirty band aid on the ground from the previous passengers where one of the children was sitting so it makes me wonder how much cleaning/sanitizing was done between flights.  The snacks were shoved at us in a plastic bag containing a biscotti cookie, water, and hand sanitizing wipe.  We were offered nothing else nor any other options. Another man on the flight was also separated from his family, by 20 rows.  He had worked it out with the passengers near his kids to switch seats but the flight attendants would not allow it even after they had moved their luggage around. I had flown Delta just before and that was a completely different experience.  Flight attendants were accommodating. They handed out sanitizing wipes so you could wipe the area before sitting, and were very helpful to their passengers.  So maybe my expectations were set too high.  I will pay extra not to fly with American Airlines in the future.","{'neg': 0.048, 'neu': 0.89, 'pos': 0.062, 'compound': 0.7181}",0.7181

The staff did all they could to avoid passengers contact but a smile or a friendly word can be done at a distance. The attendant on my connecting flight spoke into the speaker system so quickly that I did not know what she was saying.

0.7217,2021-04-01,2021-04-01,10.0,Traveling with a child? Don't fly delta,"I booked with delta through hotwire. I had never used delta before but it was the only airline that didn't have a 6am return flight. I was traveling with my boyfriend and 3 yr old son. Here's my story.First, I booked the flight and car. All the funds were pending. When it actually charged my card, I noticed it was 1 plane ticket less. I thought maybe they changed something due to my son's age, cool. So I questioned whether he would be allowed a carryon or not. The website says its based on price. Seeing as to how I wasn't sure what happened with the ticket prices, I figured I'd call to find out. I spent 9 HOURS to ask this simple question. 5 hours on hold waiting for someone to answer before I gave up, and 4 hours trying to use the online chat. Finally, I got someone, gave them the ticket number (which I figured they would say something if they missed the charge), they said yes to the carry on.Then we get to the airport. We're carrying our bags, a carseat, a stroller and a child. We were rushed through everything as if we were an inconvenience (ok whatever). We get to the gate and wait. Then our flight was delayed due to a mechanical issue with the a/c. For 2+ hours. We missed our connecting flight in Atlanta. At this point I'm stressed, but think ""better safe than sorry, things happen"".Flight back: again, rushed through security. Get to the gate. Wait. Another delay. Mechanical issue with the a/c unit. What are the chances? Again, waiting hours to get on the plane and missing our connecting flight home. Here's the kicker, it was the last flight from Minneapolis to Milwaukee that day so we were not getting home. They searched for options and said we can MAYBE get you on tomorrow but all of tomorrow's flights are booked up so we'll put you on standby and hopefully you get something. They put us in a hotel in Minneapolis for the night. I had thrown away a bunch of stuff that I didn't think we needed anymore; toothbrushes, toothpaste, trial sizes of deodorant, all of the toiletries. So we had none of that. Ok now we go to the airport again to see if we can get on a plane. They luckily said yes, gave us tickets. We wait. They announce the flight was overbooked and offered $400 for someone to take a later flight. No one took it. Eventually they landed on $600 and someone gave in. $600? I got a $50 hotel room to wait an entire day. Moving on, we go to board and they gave each of us separate seats. I asked if there was a way my 3yr old could sit by either myself or my boyfriend and they said I could figure it out myself. Finally, an attendant on the plane helped me switch seats with another rider so my toddler didn't have to sit with a stranger.We got home and I was just relieved to have it all over with.

Probably the worst customer service experience I have ever had in my life. My (under 2, lap infant) and I have flown American Airlines 9 times since she’s been born. NINE.

Every time we travel — it’s a lot — car seat, stroller, pack n play, Ainsleigh’s bag, my bag, the whole gig. And normally American is great — Ainsleigh’s baby stuff is free, my credit card membership covers my bag and I usually only have to pay for Ainsleigh’s suitcase — $40 depending on if we’re traveling as military or not.

Had I done the same transaction on the kiosk as I’ve done before - most recently July 4th weekend to Norfolk, VA — I PAID $40. But today I got sent to the priority line because the kiosks were full and my hands were full where I dealt with the manager/supervisor Quinn. Quinn was one of the most disrespectful people I’ve ever dealt with in a customer service situation, raising his voice and talking over me when I was just trying to understand how every other time I fly it’s $40 and today it’s $350. That’s a massive difference, that’s more than my plane ticket and he ultimately told me “pay the $350 or don’t fly, I don’t care” before he walked away. We didn’t have much of a choice — we have to get to Arkansas so after the back and forth when Quinn stormed off, I reluctantly paid it to the ticketing agent who apolgized to me !!!!I will never fly American again.

0.733,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,10.0,Honestly the worst flight experience ever,"Delta Air LinesI would rather rent a Uhaul and drive than fly with Delta🤮🤮🤮Please read. It is long but Delta created a huge problem for a family on our flight.They were mistreated. The behavior and treatment by these Delta employees was absolutely despicable!Tues 2/16/21: SLC to Maui direct flight delayed, then cancelled due to some mechanical issue. This was after we had boarded and taxied out to the runway. Delta put us up in hotels but the event was a nightmare for several families with young children. We were rebooked for 2/17 to fly to Maui via LAX and once we were at the departure gate (A25 I believe) we met up with a young family from the night before. They had two younger children and a three month old infant. The parents looked very tired after getting into a hotel quite late and getting up early for the flight.Once we boarded and were seated on the plane the baby started crying and I could tell that the mother was very focused on calming the infant. I visited with the husband for a minute while other passengers were coming on board, then settled into my seat. It was uncomfortably warm on the plane but I assumed (incorrectly) that once the engines started it would cool down. The two male flight attendants who initially greeted us were cheery. However the flight attendant at the rear of the plane was noticeably unfriendly. About the time the doors were closed I noticed the lead flight attendant came to the rear of the aircraft several times. He was rather easy to remember because he was wearing safety glasses/goggles. It seemed odd since everyone was seated and we were waiting to back away from the gate. And it was very warm. After 15 to 20 minutes of waiting I noticed some activity at the door where we entered the plane. Another flight with mechanical issues??? This cannot be happening again. Then I noticed a woman in a Delta uniform worn by ground crew come on board. I’m wondering if they are having a problem with a passenger since there had been no mention of a reason for this delay. It was really confusing since everyone was in their seats waiting to take off. Then this Delta employee who came on board headed toward the rear of the plane. She addresses the father seated behind me and confirms who is flying with him and says that she needs them to gather their baggage and come with her. Everyone seated in the rear of the plane is completely stunned. The father asks what is going on and he is advised that his wife was asked four times by the crew to wear her mask.He responds that she was asked by the flight attendant ONCE to wear her mask correctly and she had complied.Neither the family seated directly behind them nor my wife and I noticed her ever not wearing her mask. I would have noticed since I had been turned around visiting with the father who was seated directly behind me and I could see the wife holding the infant. An older couple seated directly in front of the mother confirmed that they had never seen her mask off.The assertion that she was asked four times is a lie. A COMPLETE LIE. A fabrication. The unfriendly flight attendant had spoken with her once. The lead flight attendant who came to the rear of the plane several times NEVER spoke with her. Every time I saw the mother she had her mask on. Not one passenger in that area of the plane noticed her with her mask off!All the passengers nearby began to question this Delta employee who had been sent to take this family off the plane. Not a bit of understanding or compassion, or acknowledgement of the difficulty Delta had caused due to the cancelled flight.We all stated that we had not observed her with her mask off. It was beyond belief. At that point I began to record the event with my phone. I explained to this woman the situation regarding the canceled flight late the night before, the early flight to LAX, etc. Honestly this young mother was probably exhausted at this point. However the Delta employee who was in the process of escorting this family off the plane seemed to be intentionally speaking very quiet. Honestly I think this may be a tactic that Delta has initiated in order to make it more difficult to record the conversations during situations like this. As the family gathered their things the passengers seated near them exchanged phone numbers. However as soon as they were escorted off the plane a passenger from a few seats in front of us came back and took over the row that had been vacated by the mother and her children. We pointed this out to the flight attendant and ask if we could change seats as we pleased and her comment was “don’t start this while we are trying to take off”. She never addressed the issue with us after take off. Once airborne it was still quite stuffy and warm so we ask her if they could get the ventilation system working to cool things off. She never returned to address either issue.So my analysis of the situation is this. Delta was very focused on passengers wearing masks. Good for them. Too bad they don’t put the same effort toward having a comfortable environment on the plane. I assume that the flight attendant did speak with the mother about her mask once, however with the baby crying, the hightemperature on board, and not least due to some level of exhaustion since Delta had cancelled their direct flight the day before.... the mask may have slipped down a bit. Possibly. However no one saw it. She was preoccupied with caring for the infant. That was my observation. Everyone I spoke with on the flight concurred.The ambient temperature in the cabin was warm for the whole flight. Warm, stuffy and again... uncomfortable.The mini water bottles and snacks were packaged as if we were on a school field trip for first grade. Honestly Goldfish and mini water bottles??? The worst commercial flight I have ever been on.However this is nothing.... nothing in comparison to the shabby treatment shown to this family.

If you’re interested to know why, read on, and to give some background I’ve been an AAdvantage member for at least 20 years, many of which I was Platinum so I know what I’m talking about. This past weekend I made a visit to my brother who lives out of state and I flew American. This is what happened: I purchased my nonstop ticket months ago and shortly before my trip American sent me an email telling me that they had changed my ticket and had added a stopover. Not only is a stopover inconvenient and I had initially paid more for a nonstop flight but they were goofy enough to state in their email that there would be “no additional charge for the change” (Why! Thank you American!). I know it’s the pandemic but they could do better (they gave me only 25 minutes for my connection!) A day before my flight they sent me an email  saying that they had changed one of the gates to a different concourse. So now not only did I only have 25 mins to make my connection (and everybody knows it can take a while for passengers to exit the plane once parked at the gate, which makes such a short connection even tighter) but also now I was arriving at a faraway concourse and had to run as fast as I could to barely make my flight. When I finally made it to my connecting flight’s gate the overhead bin space was full and so they made me check my tiny carry-on (no fault of my own), and this normally would be fine (I guess?) but with my flight arriving at my final destination a bit after midnight and after a long tiring and stressful day now I had to go stand at the baggage claim forever to wait for my tiny carryon to come out. Had they apologized or shown a tiny bit of empathy I would have understood, but nope, that didn’t happen (instead the gate agents were rude, I know they work long shifts and are stressed so I guess I should not expect at least some courtesy anymore).

I called back 2 days later, and after being on hold for over an hour, the guy answered, told me his system was locked up and I would have to call back.  So I tried the chat option, which they tout on their hold line is a great option to get service.  The person on chat told me they were still waiting on the hotel.  So I asked when the airfare portion was going to be returned and they responded that they couldn't help me with that, I would have to call.Every day I try to call or chat and I keep being told they are waiting for the hotel to get back to them, they can't tell me when the airfare portion is being refunded and to please be patient and wait for 2 more days.  It has been 8 days since my first call and still nothing.  At this point I don't even think they have contacted the hotel, I don't think they are going to refund my airfare and I think they are waiting for me to give up.I am a BIG Southwest fan (and we did get some LUV coupons because of the cancelation, from Southwest directly) but the Southwest Vacations part of the business is not going to get any other business from me. It just shouldn't be this hard to get my money back when you canceled the flight.  And no one will escalate my calls, they just tell me the supervisor can't help me.","{'neg': 0.037, 'neu': 0.916, 'pos': 0.047, 'compound': 0.7417}",0.7417

I got to Seattle Tacoma airport 1 hour before my flight, and I used the automated kiosk to print my boarding pass. It gave me an error message, and when I tried to check 3 bags, it said a Delta agent would assist me shortly. So I waited 5-10 minutes, and when it was clear that no one was coming to help me, I got in line to talk to the agent behind the bag check terminal.  I told the lady there that I was active duty military, showed her my ID, and asked her to confirm that my boarding pass was TSA Precheck, because I knew it would get me through security much faster.  Since I didn't book the flight myself (it was booked through SATO), it turned out that they didn't put my DoD ID number in to ensure it was. Okay, that should have been an easy fix. However, the lady at the terminal took so long with the process that she said it was less than 40 minutes before the flight, and consequently it was too late to check my bags. She literally moved slower than a sloth. She then told me I needed to talk to a customer service agent at a different location. Well, at that point, any chance I had of making my flight was gone. The next woman I talked to behind the customer service desk said I had to rebook my flight, and that it would cost me $75.

I know perfectly well that when PCS traveling, the service member does not need to pay for checked bags. I told her so as diplomatically and cordially as I possibly could.

0.757,2021-08-01,2021-08-01,10.0,You have a connecting flight?  Too bad,"First off, I would like to start this with a positive.  I appreciated the cleanliness efforts including the wipes for each passenger that was handed out.  I always bring my own even before Covid, so it is certainly appreciated.  Now onto the not so good.  My husband and I flew with you guys back in May from Mexico and it was a less than stellar experience.  Boarding was a big cluster of a mess and I was not allowed to board with my husband, who was seated next to me.  Fast forward to this past week's experience.  My Mom had two heart attacks unexpectedly and we had to fly at the last minute.  Now typically we choose to fly with Alaska but they did not have an itinerary that would work for the day I needed to depart.  So, I decided to give Delta another shot because I believe one not so great experience does not mean they all will be.  This is a choice I soon regretted.  We had an afternoon flight out of Seattle and boarding began late.  I knew we had a tight connection in Salt Lake (it was somewhere in the ballpark of 30ish minutes).  I approached the desk and asked if we were leaving on time and she said no.  I inquired if I would have time to make my connection and she said that we'd be landing on time despite leaving late and that I should be fine once she checked the flight.  I was skeptical but believed her- it's her job and she does this all the time, right?We take off almost 30 minutes late.  I am starting to not be certain we will make it but I sit back and trust the system.  We landed and came to find out (my party was seated in the back of the plane) that almost all of the passengers around me had 30ish minutes to make their connections too.  Now over the speakers we hear something to the tune of if you miss your connection, go to the help desk.  I balk at this.  It would be very simple to tell the passengers to stay seated and let the people who have tight connections off first, since this was your airline's fault and not the fault of the passengers.  This did not happen.  Seems to me that it would save everyone a lot of trouble... including the help desk who would have to deal with upset customers.  But hey, I guess I am wrong.  We run once the crowd breaks and this would have been fine because the gate was only a few gates away.  We get there and the walkway is still extended but no one is at the desk.  I panic... don't forget... my mother is in the hospital... on a ventilator after her heart attacks.  I run over to the next desk and she is kind enough to call someone which was for nothing as I turn around I see the walkway retracting.  What ensued was my husband trying to keep me from having a full on meltdown.  After I was calm he told me that a gate agent finally showed up and called him a liar that we were not there before the walkway retracted.  Great customer service, let me tell you.  We hurriedly made our way to the help desk.  My husband has to end up dealing with it because I am so upset.  We were given a few options and finally settled on taking a midnight flight to Atlanta and then from Atlanta to my final destination at San Antonio.  There was no guarantee that my husband could even be on the last leg of the flight with my daughter and I.  We had to just hope.Flight to Atlanta went off fine with little to no sleep.  I ended up resting a little at the airport but was utterly exhausted and still had a full day ahead of me.   My husband was on the standby as the first person and once I boarded with my daughter we just held our breath in hope that he would get on.  We were the last passengers on the plane that weren't ticketed.  After that another 6 or 7 people were boarded even though my husband was right at the gate and assured by the desk he would be first standby.  More great customer service.  I don't mind not being number one but I sure do mind being lied to.  Luckily, he was able to get on and we made it to San Antonio together, albeit with a very bad taste in our mouth from our experience.  We arrived back home last night and I was waiting till I had time to write this and be able to articulate it without coming off as completely nasty.  Want to know the irony of this?  We flew Alaska home- a direct flight.  As we landed I was still listening to music and out of the corner of my eye I saw my family laughing.  I removed my earbud and asked what.  Can you guess?

We had to make 2 layovers. The last one was at Minneapolis International Airport. Upon arriving at Rochester International Airport we could not find our luggage on the baggage carousel. There was a baggage handler by the baggage carousel. The man was wearing an orange reflective vest and advised that there was not any other luggage on the plane. The man asked us to follow him over to the Delta Airlines ticket counter. The man started looking on the computer. The man could not give me a straight answer. He was not sure where the luggage was and if it would be on the next flight from Minneapolis International Airport. He said if it makes it onto the next flight in a couple hours it would be at the Rochester International Airport around 09:30. The house we were going to was about 18 miles from the airport. I asked if the luggage could be brought out to the house that we were staying at if it arrives around 09:30. The man said no they stop delivering luggage at 10:00. The baggage handle had a very poor attitude and was acting as if it was our fault that the airlines lost our luggage, and we were bothering him by asking for our luggage. I asked if I could speak with a supervisor, but he refused and advised that he was the supervisor. I was very put off by his poor attitude and lack of effort in trying to help us. I mentioned that progressive thinking and putting the luggage on the flight that we were on just isn’t tolerated at Delta Airlines. The baggage handler / supervisor stepped back from the counter and advised that he did not want to or was he going to help us. The baggage handler asked one of the Delta Airline ticket counter employees to help us and then walked away. The ticket counter employee looked at our ticket slips and started typing on the key board. I said to the ticket counter person (I apologize but if they guy before you had apologized for losing our luggage I would not feel so mistreated). The counter person at this time threw the luggage tickets on the counter and then started yelling very loudly that he was not going to help us and that there was no one else in that airport that would help. My wife stepped up to the counter and advised that her father just passed away two days ago and she needs to get home to her mother. The ticket counter person said he doesn’t care and it is not his problem. I stepped outside and called the 800 Delta Airlines customer service phone number. I told her about my concerns and dilemma. She was very polite and on behalf of Delta Airlines she apologized. The phone representative asked me for the luggage tickets and was able to find our luggage in under 30 seconds, and make sure it was going to get on the next flight from the Minneapolis International Airport to the Rochester International Airport. I had to drive back to the airport and be there at 09:30 to get my luggage.  Moral of the story is if you fly Delta Airlines to the Rochester International Airport, Don’t be surprised if your luggage is lost, the people who work there have bad attitudes, just don’t care and will not help you.","{'neg': 0.07, 'neu': 0.86, 'pos': 0.071, 'compound': 0.7587}",0.7587

0.7621,2022-02-01,2022-02-01,30.0,Read small print on cancellation policy,"This review refers more to American's refund policy than the actual flight I took.  I find it an airline like most of the rest with little interest in the customer.  No better, no worse than the other major US airlines.   I do find their $60 fee for first bag excessive. Because of covid the airlines are trying to attract customer by offering lenient cancellation terms.  I want people to know that American's terms include the following as I recently had to cancel a trip due to covid.  This is what I found in my particular case, but I suggest any flyer should check their situation before booking. 1.  The cancellation fee in my situation was $200 per ticket.  This can add up if you are flying with multiple people. 2.  I had the option to change my dates at no charge, but if you booked at a higher rate, you get no refund if your follow up trip is less.3.  You can get a voucher towards future travel (as they call it) implying that you have the full fare to use as you want.  Your travel must be COMPLETED prior to the date you originally PURCHASED the tickets.  So in other words, if you purchased your Christmas. tickets early say, July and you cancel.  You have to complete our trip prior to July in order to use the voucher.  It should, be like for like, either you book within one year of your original booking date or you need to complete travel by the end date of the cancelled reservation. 4.  In addition to this restriction the small print tells you that this voucher is only good for ONE trip and only for the original passengers.  So if you had a trip to Europe scheduled for $2000 for you and your husband and you want to fly with your daughter to visit another daughter in the US.  You would need to pay for your daughter's ticket and you would lose the balance of the voucher which will probably be in excess of $1000.

Many passengers removed masks after boarding with no visible encouragement by flight attendants to replace them (at least not  the 9 passengers surrounding us who were not wearing masks). My wife and I are in a higher risk group being elderly with some medical concerns.

No social distancing no one seat in between someone you didn't know. We were packed into that flight like sardines, which I normally wouldn't mind but hello covid is a thing so It was very very uncomfortable. Aside from that the flight wasnt so bad and our connecting flight for the last leg of the journey there wasnt as full however they didnt enforce mask wearing on this flight as the woman behind us had hers off the majority of the hour flight. The return flights is where American Air really shined. We were once again stuck next to someone we didnt know but since there were open seats they allowed us to move so we could practice social distancing. The staff was friendly and although we had some weather issues and had to run to our connecting flight home overall it was a great flight.

None of the gate agents or customer service people on the phone could help me. But I finally went through the long and complicated process of requesting refunds online for those ""lost"" premium seats. In my opinion, since AA already has all the ticket information, flight/seat changes, and final schedules in their database, customers shouldn't have to spend hours finding and entering 13-digit numbers for every flight and every traveler when a refund is plainly warranted. But because it was either that or lose over $100, I spent the time doing what was required. (Honestly, I think most people would simply give up in frustration--as I almost did several times.) BUT--to AA's credit--after I filed four separate requests (one for each of us on two different flights), the refunds began hitting our bank account within a few days.

Our flight time was changed several weeks before our flight, but then on the morning of the flight, we had multiple schedule changes.  This is always understandable, although I have found it very rare on other airlines and usually, when there is a delay, it is changed once or twice.  With Southwest, we were notified that our 12:00 flight was delayed until 1:20, then 2:10, then around 10:20 in the morning we got a text that the flight was delayed until 3:15.  Since we live an hour away from the airport, we decided to wait it out at home.  Suddenly, after 11:00, we get a text that our flight has been moved AHEAD by more than two hours and was now scheduled to leave at 1:00 PM. This gave us less than 2 hours to get to the airport, park, check our bags and get through security, and we had to race to get there and almost missed it.  Once we were on board, we heard other passengers talking about it as well, and most were not happy with the time being moved ahead on such short notice.  I am sure some actually missed the flight.  I also do not care for Southwest's seating procedure. You are given a boarding number, but then it is kind of a free for all when choosing a seat.  People are holding seats, trying to get more room, and by the end of the line, some families and couples are split up.  I don't like this. I like having the chance to put my family together.

Here is the reason why their new approach to customer service has moved me away from them.In the last 6 months there has been a significant downgrade in their level of support. A live example - 8 of us were flying to Costa Rica and of course I convinced the crew to all fly delta even though American was cheaper. They changed the flight weeks from time we were suppose depart and the change left a 20 minute layover in ATL. I called to see if the flight needed to be moved and was told that Delta would change their flight again and to wait. You guessed it, the flight was not changed. I called again and was told if I stay on this flight I would miss my layover and the next flight goes out the following day. After hours of back and forth, we came to the conclusion that the group of us would have to fly in a day early and get a hotel and that “Delta would take care of you”. I called the group and we moved our flights and then I called back to get confirmation and was told they would not compensate us for the hotel because “this is not a Delta issue it is a flight change”. We all had to pay for a hotel which not only did we pay more for our flights because of our loyalty but now we incurred an additional expense directly related to Delta because of a flight change.

When it's time to board, these people will WALK ON THE PLANE WITH NO ASSISTANCE leaving the truly disabled - those who NEED ASSISTANCE - waiting for someone to help them. This happened to my mother, who is 92. She truly needs assistance walking down the ramp - and by the time she was helped onto the plane, the first FOUR ROWS were taken by able passengers. Yes, they may have had diabetes, or asthma, or heart issues.  But someone who needs help WALKING down the ramp ought to be allowed on the plane first.   OR....the entire family who was with the person in the wheelchair gets on the plane - all of  them , my mother witnessed 4 people get on the plane with the person who was wheeled up to the gate, yet the wheelchair person gets up and walks ably to the plane - and they take up space that the person who cannot walk that far could have had.

No problem, 3 other flights later that day out of Salt Lake, but despite being the 2nd for Stand By on the 1st flight, I never made the flight despite the gate agent handing out $700 vouchers to 4 people to fly on the later flight.  The best they could offer me was a flight out the next day!!  Again, another real sketchy business practice.  After protesting, they hooked me up with a flight on another carrier to another city to catch a 3rd flight to my destination.  Only problem was that when I checked the board on the other carrier, it was delayed until after the flight in Seattle departed.  Went back to the desk and miraculously, 1 seat opened up on a Delta flight to Seattle in which I could make the additional flight down to Portland.

The problem happened when I could not find a flight that worked during the times I needed because I have class,  I asked to change the destination and see if that would work.   They found a flight that worked (with a huge lay over ).  The AA representative proceeded to tell me that I needed to pay for the price difference because I changed my destination.   ( I get that policy when I call to change my flight because I want to change something,  not forced too by the air lines who change my flight).

I pointed to the hangers behind the last seats (all of which were empty) and finally as everyone was seated she reluctantly came and grabbed our coats without a word and hung them, not without an attitude.  Is COVID the excuse for lack of caring service?  I've been flying 1st class for over 20 years and find the service so minimal and unattentive that the only benefit on board for paying such prices was the size of the seat and space.  Morning flights don't really benefit from free beverages in my opinion.  Once the beverages and basket of chips was offered that was it for the service.  The attendant never returned to check on us or ask if there was anything we would like.  First class used to be first class......now it seems to be coach with large comfy seats and more leg room.

Imagine showing up for your vacation and finding out then that you have not flight! Called American's customer service. The option was to wait on hold or get a call back in over 4 hours. That was 2:30 in the morning. I opted for that because this had to get resolved now. The call came at 2:30am (middle of the night waking me up). I spent 45 minutes with their rep who at first didn't even know his  own airline cancelled the flights. Finally got rebooked. Well, after work today I checked on line. The original cancelled flight was removed. That's good. The newly promised flights were no where to be seen. At this point I have been waiting over 3 hours on hold listening to ""your call is important to us."" B***S***. If I don't hear from them tonight, its off to the airport tomorrow to speak to an agent at the counter. Do not book directly with American Airlines. They don't give a damn. Use Expedia.

There's nothing quite like the expectation of a promise of delivery of you and your luggage to a destination, only to sit in an aircraft on the tarmac for the better part of two hours while they figure out that the aircraft, which was sitting at the airport for the entire day in winter weather, needed to be de-iced. While in flight, I asked a flight attendant about whether he could tell if the connection I was supposed to make would be held or not.  He shrugged and said I'd be better off checking the app online.  It was pretty clear that a two hour delay in departure ate up the 90 minutes I previously had for a layover, and 15 minutes before our arrival my connecting flight had already departed.  The gate attendants directed me and many of my fellow passengers to the growing line at customer service (which only had one person staffing it for quite some time).  Eventually, more American Airlines staff members began to ""help"" stranded customers.  My plight was not as bad as those pitiable families with children who clearly needed some good news.  I hope they got better than I did.  The news I received was that American's failure to figure out de-icing was not their fault, but God's, and that they had coded the delay as a weather delay.  Mind you, many other airlines managed to get their planes in the air.  Given that American Airlines has their own de-icing operation, it seems like an organization issue and lack of customer service.  All that said, I got the privilege of paying for a hotel room and 24 hours of waiting for the next flight.  As I sit in an airport with minimal heating, I'm hopeful that the snow storm raging outside the DFW airport windows will not delay them yet again.

There was even a line in Nexus and I have never seen a line in Nexus in the amount of years that I have traveled. Myself and others ended up missing our flights, because airport personnel did not want to provide priority to those that have been waiting almost two hours (some even more) and their flights were departing within a short period of time. Air Canada needs to train their employees much better. When I missed my flight, I was told to go past customer service and use their courtesy white phones to reschedule my flight. I booked my ticket with United Airlines but it was operating through Air Canada. I even checked in through Air Canada and received my boarding pass with Air Canada. While I was on the phone with the rep, she advised (incorrectly) that I had to contact United. When I contacted United, they told me I should be speaking with Air Canada. Between 8.50am and 9.30am, I was on hold and being passed back and forth between the airlines. I then went to the Air Canada customer service desk and was able to rebook my flight without any hassle. So again, I was given the incorrect information from the Air Canada rep, whom I spoke with on the phone. By the time I was able to re book my flight, the next flight leaving wasn't until 2:45pm, connected in DC and my next flight out of DC wasn't til after 10.30pm. I spent 14-15 hours in airports for what would have been a 1 hour and change direct flight, if TSA coordinated much better. Also, we were required to take a covid 19 test prior to leaving the country and no one at Toronto Pearson Airport asked me for my Covid 19 results. This is definitely a compliance issue with the requirement of the Government, to provide proof of a negative covid 19 result.","{'neg': 0.035, 'neu': 0.909, 'pos': 0.056, 'compound': 0.8477}",0.8477

We, along with another couple, moved back one row to the exit row.  We were approached by a very rude, large, male flight attendant and told that these were premium seats and we had to pay for them or go back to our seats. We thought he was joking and continued to sit there.  My husband, a retired Navy veteran of 21 years who was ticketed in a different row from me on a flight with 50 plus seats available, told him that the other flight attendant had told us it was ok. This man said, “I don’t care what he told you. Go back to your seats”. I moved back up one row in front of the exit rows to my original seat. My seat didn’t recline even though the person in front of me was reclined the entire flight. The seat next to me was empty but my husband returned to his ticketed seat. It seems to me that it would be safer to have people sitting in the exit rows in the event someone needed to deploy the doors. Why in the world would these seats come at a higher cost if someone is willing to sit there and be responsible for helping others?

The manager on duty wouldn’t even try to assist. They tried to bring me the paperwork of what is required, I said sir i understand because I’ve flown with them 3 times in the last few months and it was fine every single time.

After the manager had walked away, I kept waiting and asked a man working if he was getting another manager or someone to help me figure out what to do (my cats don’t live here and you let them fly here) he said he had other things to do.. we hadn’t come to a solution. It was like no matter what I said 1+1 would never equal 2 with him. Pretty sure he called the girls at the ticket desk because they “kindly reminded me” that I can’t open the container or what it’s made to do.. I took one cat, put her under my seat, opened her up like I have done every other time. Specifically asked the people around me if it was a bother, they loved it. They don’t make noise, they don’t take up space, it fits perfectly under the seat. Just irritating I had to separate the kittens and at 32 years old my mother is still right. Never fly American.

However, the experience has been incredibly and unexpectedly bad! First of all, humbly, jugging by my experience, I find it hard to believe that whomever designed the new SLC has ever been in an airport before. SLC is unbelievably the worst airport I've ever experienced in my over 1.5 million miles flown! A 25 minute power walk between security and the gates, really? The tunnel between A and B gates is too narrow for the passenger volume and out of the 3 escalators, 2 are for arriving passengers and 1 is for departing passengers. Here is a tip: It should be the other way around, departing passengers are more likely to have time constraints (such as getting to their gate so they don't miss their flight) than arriving ones. Then coming back it took SLC 1h 9 minutes to deliver my bags beating Madrid's 35 minutes and Paris CDG's little over 30 minutes. There are no seats by the baggage claim area, so plan to be standing for an hour while the bags travel from the gate to the baggage claim. -Finding your way out of the airport is challenging, especially if you're being picked up by a friend or family. I would say that the overall airport signage is the opposite of intuitive (just like in most European airports), but that's a far lesser issue given the other problems. At baggage claim I spoke with the airline staff, they were very nice and apologetic, but clearly frustrated with the airport design and management. They told me it's been like this since they've opened the new SLC in late 2020. Not sure if the SLC leadership reads these reviews or if they're even capable of realizing that maybe it's time to resign? Honestly, I've been in very poor countries and they have far better designed and run airports, costing far less than the $4.1 billion. Hope it gets better next time I use SLC, for now I'm going to avoid it as much as possible.","{'neg': 0.081, 'neu': 0.813, 'pos': 0.106, 'compound': 0.8684}",0.8684

I was sent a survey from the airline and for the most part I have had good interactions with American. Ticket agents very helpful and gate agents the same. One day I was sent a survey and jokingly I put why when you call military you don’t mention us combat veterans. We paved the way for these young soldiers today. I sent the survey and about one week later I received an email and in so many words told me to board when military is called as long as I have a valid ID. So I have been doing that. Lately twice I was told I could not board. I mentioned the survey and email I received. Still was not allowed which is jo big deal because I am in group 3. I just can’t believe this is how American would treat veterans. Oh well I guess this is how it is. Soon I will be in group 1 as I mentioned I travel often.

She also said we didnt do a covid test, which we did, just hadn't received a result either way. She told us to contact customer service but they would tell us the same thing so we would be wasting our time.

At some point, the night before - after we'd gone to bed, our flight was cancelled. In the morning (4am) we discovered the texts advising us our flight was cancelled and they couldn't rebook us.  We were heading to Bermuda for a cruise, only one flight a day, so rebooking later wouldn't have helped. We had to call the cruise line and, luckily, they rebooked us with no hassle.  This time we drove the 6 hours to CLT the day before.  We got to the airport 4 hours ahead, obtained our seat assignment and went to the gate.  Boarding started, but our group was never called.  We asked what was going on and were told the plane had a weight limit so we couldn't board.  Other people were still boarding. Then we were told they'd given our seats to someone else since we hadn't checked in. We proved we had, they wouldn't budge. We finally started taking names and pictures of the gatekeepers telling them we were going to sue AA.  They got on the phone, talked in hush tones with their backs to us, and we were finally ""allowed"" to board. Once on board everything was great.  On our return flight they attempted to take my husbands oxygen generator away saying there wasn't room in the overheads.  We forcefully explained that since they allowed other passengers to have multiple oversized bags board without checking anything, they could allow his one personal carry-on (8""x14""). They relented.  Again, once on board, all went well.","{'neg': 0.021, 'neu': 0.932, 'pos': 0.046, 'compound': 0.872}",0.872

0.8723,2020-06-01,2020-06-01,10.0,Worst Airline Experience (Will not be signing up for their credit card now),"Hello,I don't normally write reviews, but I had to get this off my chest for others to hear.I will not be traveling American Airlines again. I was looking at getting their credit card to get the benefits and the bonus miles for signing up, but I will now be looking at United or Delta Airlines.To start off, our flight from Philly to Phoenix scheduled to leave at 7am was delayed first 20 minutes, then another 20 minutes, then 2 hours. After that they got another airplane to leave from a different gate for those who still wanted to take the flight to Phoenix. However, that plane also had problems and was delayed until further notice. Couldn't even give us an expected take-off time. Customer service did the best they could to find us new flights because we missed our connecting flight from Phoenix to Redmond. However, the best they could do was tell us to wait until our delayed plane took off to Phoenix, then stay the night in Phoenix, then they got us a flight from Phoenix to Portland at 7:30am the next day. Yea that's right Portland. 3 hours from Redmond, Oregon which is our destination. They did not have any more flights from Phoenix or anywhere for that matter to Redmond. To make things worse we are traveling in a group of 7. We all got on the flight from Philly to Phoenix that finally left at 11:30am (4.5 hours later). Then we all stayed the night in Phoenix because they had no more flights from Phoenix to Portland or Redmond that day. They did give us 2 free hotel rooms (they told us it would be 3, but when we checked into the hotel it was for only 2 rooms). That's not a big deal, but why tell us we have 3 rooms when we only had 2 rooms?Now, I am writing this review in Phoenix airport at 9am. 5 out of our group of 7 got a flight from Phoenix to Portland at 7:30am. That leaves myself and another person stuck in Phoenix until our flight at 2:30pm. Now, our group of 5 friends have to wait in Portland airport from 10:15am when they land until 5:15pm when us two land. Then we had to rent a car for $100 that we will have to drive 3 hours from Portland to Redmond because Redmond is our final destination. So after everything said and done, our group of 7 will now be in Redmond, Oregon around 9pm at night on Friday. We were supposed to be there at 1:30pm on Thursday. That's a whole day and a half misssed of our vacation.To top it all off, my girlfriend had to check her carry on bag. So it was on the plane that we were supposed to leave on from Philly, but it got put on another plane and did not get to Phoenix until 9pm later that night. So we left the phoenix airport at around 4pm when we got there then had to go back to the airport from our hotel to get her bag. I normally do not write reviews, but this was a horrific experience. I know American Airlines did the best they could, but it seems like there are always issues with their planes and departure times. It was just a mess as there was not enough customer service staffed in Philly. They said to keep our receipts from uber and the car rental place for reimbursement, but they said they doubt we would get reimbursed. So we have to spend extra time and money to get to our destination that they will most likely not reimburse. That is why I gave them 1 star. Not everyone has had this experience. Just know that it could happen to you if it happened to me and the way the whole situation was handled was very poor.","{'neg': 0.064, 'neu': 0.867, 'pos': 0.069, 'compound': 0.8723}",0.8723

The flight attendant had the supervisors call the cops on us. There was 4 cops & 2 supervisors waiting for us in the gate when you walk off the plane. Obviously face masks are required during the flight, unless you were eating or drinking. During the flight, my husband fell asleep and I put my earbuds in and started drawing. He slept with a neck pillow and his face mask would catch on the pillow and slightly fall lower than his nose. The flight attendant woke him up a couple times and asked him to pull it back up. He apologized and went back to sleep. As far me, I went into my purse to grab 2 mints and a protein bar. I pulled my face mask down to put the mint in my mouth. The flight attendant snapped and told me to put my mask back on, I said I was eating. She said, “it’s only a mint and if this is going to be an issue, I’ll call the supervisor!” And stormed off. We land and get off the plane only to be greeted by the cops. The cops questioned us on what happened on the flight. The cop told us that face to face conflict/confrontation was reported from the flight attendant and that’s why they were called. The supervisor looked up our return flight and revoked them. All over sleeping and eating a mint. The flight attendant might have had a bad day but it’s not enough justification to go out of your way to wreck our trip. Her behavior is unacceptable. I understand you want to keep everyone safe. But you’re taking it too far. Not once did we raise our voice, or stand up and cause issues. Revoking our tickets over something this small, is unbelievable. If it’s that big of deal to eat on the flight, then stop serving water and snacks.

In the email I received it was stated that if I was not able to accomodate this change, it was possible to cancel this reservation and get a refund. However, when I tried to cancel my trip ALL the $303.20 value of the ticket was going to be lost in cancellation fees. This is UNACCEPTABLE. Recently I had the same exact issue with a flight I booked with United Airlines, and first of all I got 3 different alternative flight schedules to choose from, and since also in that case no one of the proposed changes fit my travel requirements, I had to cancel the flight and within a few days I got a FULL refund.

It's almost like they took everything good about the last airport (and there was a lot of good) and tried to do the opposite. Starting with something the old airport struggled with, pickup and drop-off. The old airport was almost always packed and difficult to deal with, so what was their solution? Make less space to pickup and drop-off...brilliant!! Off to a great start! Now let's take something the old airport did well and completely butcher it. You had very little distance to walk with the old airport because you had two terminals with separate security lines (three if you count the international terminal, it was a genius layout). This new airport has one security line and then once you're in the terminal, you start all the way at the end of a quarter mile (at least) corridor. Then if you want to get to the next terminal, you have to walk halfway down the first, then another 1/8th of a mile under the tarmac, then walk all the way down to wherever your gate is. I mean, it's laughable how poorly it is designed. Especially given that most people in Utah have a ton of kids. I only have two (very) young kids and it is a nightmare to get luggage and kids from the drop off area all the way to the gate. We were lucky enough to have another couple help us each time we've done it. The brain power and decision making that went into this new airport is embarrassing. At least look at what works at other airports and copy that if you can't come up with a better idea.

There are countries around the world needing vaccines to save their schools, economy and the lives of the citizens and to destress their over taxed hospitals. And the employees of American Airlines  made their political movement our problem. They are the epitome of American entitlement and it affected my work. Not to mention, the crew who did show up were annoyed, and the pilot took advantage of a captured audience to express his political platform and apologized for the mask mandate on the plane. The employees who affected travelers around the world did not display heroism.. but instead affected paying customers—- who pay their salaries—-peoples lives and businesses. I will not use American Airlines again, nor will my business.

My husband owns a business and flys long distances with the distance totals earning him Gold Medallion status, but the trip durations are months at a time, so he makes roughly 3-4 international trips annually.  We used to buy the Delta Club access for him, but I was unable to use it without traveling with him (I occasiinally visit him) so I opened an American Express account so that I could pay to use the club when I traveled alone.  That was wonderful until months after opening the account, they discontinued that benefit so I closed the account.  Now the Club only allows Delta One Members which is disappointing to say the least. I  still fly first class, but I've begun to notice the lack of little things. At Prioriry Check-In there were only two representatives working the counter and just as many people waiting in line as the general lines, no more water waiting at your seat when you arrive, no service before taking off, no more complimentary  ""higher speed' access, no more glassware or gourmet meals.  Even the snack selections are dwindling.  I was offered the same two snack boxes 4 times.  The only benefit I see to flying first class anymore is no luggage fee, priority access to the TSA Security lines and priority boarding.  Now many airports offer appointment security check-in options and airlines are out pricing Delta.  It is disappointing to see the service I have come to use and love going away.  I hope things change soon before I have to change carriers and reestablish myself.","{'neg': 0.093, 'neu': 0.794, 'pos': 0.113, 'compound': 0.8858}",0.8858

It is chaos, stressful and inefficient and on top of that now also sort of useless as our passports were not even checked upon reaching the front of the line, we were simply waved through. We transited from international to international twice and the waiting time was close to 3 hours both ways. With just 1 or 2 officers serving the line (and for certain intervals none at all as the officers led passengers to secondary) of up to 500 arriving foreigners it was pure agony to see the time tick away realizing soon our connections would be lost. The foreigners section is shared with the wheelchair passengers and I have never seen so many wheelchair passengers in my life, only when those lines clear an additional officer will serve the waiting foreigners. The previously installed machines where you would do your passport reading, photo and fingerprints are gone, so that option of - sort of - fast tracking is no longer available. And mind you, we are still far away from pre-covid travel volumes. I can only imagine what the situation will be like further in the season. Oh and one more thing, customs is also gone, so that saves you some time. My advice: do not plan any connections under 5 hours. Apart from this, I find DFW a pleasant airport, once you are airside things are spacious, calm and organized. Retail wasn't quite fully operational but the offer seems solid. I especially like entering through the B-terminal that is small scale, with quick and easy security. Once you are in you can reach every terminal quick and easy using the train. Entering the USA as a foreigner has always been hit or miss depending on travel volumes but I would stay away from DFW at this time.","{'neg': 0.055, 'neu': 0.852, 'pos': 0.093, 'compound': 0.8861}",0.8861

I was supposed to get married in March of 2020 one week after the shutdown so of course we needed to cancel.  Never in our wildest dreams did we think we would have to cancel our wedding once let alone twice due to traveling still not being safe for Dominick.  With vaccinations and places beginning to accommodate children with special needs I was hoping to take my boys to California to go the the beach and Disney land in September for Dominicks 4th birthday.  It would also be his first birthday he would get to celebrate with my family since I am from California.  When I called to receive a  one month extension on his travel credits it was really surprising to me that they said no. Usually I do try to be understanding but I guess I am tired of people telling my son no which we have heard a lot of during this pandemic.  I guess it just surprises me that there are zero accommodations being made for people with disabilities.  In March Southwest made a form available to people with disabilities like my son who has sensory sensitivities which I feel like is a step forward.  But even now the flight credit would only be made available to my son for 4 months, even though at this time I am not so sure I would feel safe traveling with him even now.  Which makes his time period to travel even shorter.  He had a flight credit that was only made available to him in a time period he couldn't use it due to his disability and the representative had to say to me was ""I don't know what to tell you.""  Just like when Disney refused to give any service to my son ""it wasn't personal"".  I am not sure how it's so easy for people to so casually be insensitive to a child who is constantly having to overcome obstacles and how heart wrenching it is for his mother to watch.

I have been in crazy wait times and even had airplanes take off in 98 degree weather when AC was broke. I have never left one bad comment. Today that ends when you completely disregard the life of my handicapped child. The mommy in my wife was very concerned about my handicapped daughter traveling. After calling American and being assured  she would be personally cared for and not left unattended I convinced my wife that American was a reputable company that would take care of our child. The flight to her location didn't vary from this thought she was escorted through DFW and watched. Then came the trip home through Chicago O'Hair. To give you an idea my daughter's IQ is probably about the level of a 4 year old. She can not read and her speach  is very impaired. She is however 29 years old please don't judge my decision to let her go unless you yourself have spent 6 months side by side in the NICU with you loved one after birth as well as the many hospital stays there after. My wife and I would never endanger her life knowingly. My daughter does however like most of us like to feel somewhat independent. When her brother asked her to come see him she was so excited. We never knew what inherent risks loomed. While my daughter's ticket had every note on it to indicate she can not be left alone. She was wheeled to the next gate and left alone and with out a complete understanding of travel she missed her flight. This was in Chicago O'Hare.The horror started when we received a call from her. She stated she couldn't find  any workers and was left alone at gate. We immediately panicked and told her she had to find someone. She got an agent that knew nothing about her being dropped at the gate. The agent then called a supervisor and you would think our problems would have been over. Not in the least they could not find her another flight out to Jacksonville from Chicago even though it was around 9pm. Then the supervisor started telling us how they could get an Uber driver and hotel for her. Really?  In the middle of Chicago they wanted to have my 4foot mentality delayed daughter catch an Uber and stay in a hotel? After a good 2hours of my wife on the phone asking for  cro which by law we should be able to talk  with having a disabled child we were unable to get him to transfer us.

For those that connect through DFW, you know that weather plays a big part in if you get off the ground, if your plane has made it in for your connection.  Sometimes, the airline just cancels a flight or ""delays"" a flight overnight and says it's weather. Our flight had a 11 hour ""delay"" which meant an unexpected overnight in Dallas.  Plane was in Dallas. I saw it.  No weather on either end. i was connecting in DFW.American swears it was weather. Ok.. fine.. 11 hour delay and you think it's ok to tell someone no meal voucher, sleep in the airport? we're not going to do anything for you you are on your own.  Not only that, when I ask a gate agent to tell  me what is going on, I'm rudely ushered away like they can't be bothered to take a breath. In today's economy, where airlines are hurting, wouldn't you think the more appropriate thing to do is recognize and speak to your loyal customers vs. throwing them to the wolves?  I've flown loyally on this airline for over 40 years, have gold status and am a member of their admirals club.  All going away when it expires because they have no concept of customer service. My recommendation - they are expensive over competitors, and no longer know how to treat their customers.

0.8916,2021-11-01,2021-11-01,50.0,Travel from Upstate NY to Austin TX,"I have to admit after years of flying SWA with great results these last few months had be nervous. We had made our reservations in August-and then the great melt down of October came. As we came to see-it was not just SWA-lots of other airlines experienced the same issues. This post pandemic or ongoing pandemic world is a whole other set of rules and circumstances. I wanted to report in our experience. Our flight down to Austin thru BWI was flawless and we arrived 30mins early! Can't beat that. Whew. Full disclosure we always take the earliest possible flights on whatever airlines we travel as when connections are involved and they always will be for us-you just never know what will happen. Flight home left exactly on time and again going thru BWI. We were not even 20mins into the flight when the Pilot came on and asked about Doctors, Nurses EMTs on board. Something was going on in the back of plane but I sure did not want to turn around and look. One of the Flight attendants who had been in the back came up front really quickly and grabbed all the emergency equipment from the overhead. We knew this was not good at all-I looked at my husband and we just shrugged our shoulders as there but for the Grace go all of us! Sometime later, the Pilot came on and explained we were diverting to Memphis TN so medical personnel could come on board and take passenger to nearest facility. They kept us apprised the entire time. Touched down in Mempis, emergency personnel on board immediately and took passenger and family off-how scary and sad for them-can anyone imagine? Fueled up, did some sort of paperwork and off we went. Meanwhile we knew we had missed our connection and I was trying to decide what we needed todo-rebook mid-flight-bought the extra internet so could do that -then, ding goes my phone with a text from SWA alerting me/us that we have been auto rebooked on the next flight! Could not have asked for a better outcome. We landed little over an hour late, not bad! Had plenty of time in BWI now we had lunch and had a very uneventful flight home. I think we were maybe 3 hrs or 2.5hrslate?So no big deal as this was the final destination.So in summary-I had a nightmare flight in July on another major airline across country that was not handled at all-in fact had to buy a ticket home on a different airline and then fight with that original carrier for almost 90 days to get my refund on a flight they cancelled due to no flight crew. Air travel has really not been any fun for awhile and now with all the mandates and flights booked to full capacity and little staff-its really hard. I am writing this review to say that I think SWA is working on its issues and that we were thrilled at how our situation was handled. Reading prvevious reviews of missed vacations and so on -again I can relate. What any consumer can hope is that the airline realizes and is working to fix problems the best they can. Many thanks to SWA for dealing so well with a situation that was entirely one not of their making. And my faith humanity was restored as they wheeled the poor passenger off the plane and I did not hear or see any grumblings from a fully packed plane -as I said there but for the grace go any of us.","{'neg': 0.078, 'neu': 0.831, 'pos': 0.09, 'compound': 0.8916}",0.8916

The sign as you enter the main hall connecting them even says right on it ""7 minute walk.""

In our case, they both happened to be at completely opposite ends because of course they did. I would not be surprised it if was a mile of walking and possibly even more.

The fares paid are cheaper and they can hinder the main goal of each flight…close the door and pull back from the gate…on time. The city of Atlanta runs the airport.

They had staff standing round doing nothing other say sorry or suck it when in this day and age they could have handed them iPads to process stranded passengers as Emirates of Qatar Airways might have done. They could have shown more compassion and been more help in finding a sleeping place for stranded passengers but none of the American Airways staff seemed to care ; and there was no one to complain. When I wrote a letter of complaint the reply i received said they’d respond in 7-10days. The wait on their helpline was over an hourThe incompetence is amazing and the lack of regard for passengers shocking. It surprises me that Americans choose to patronise an airline with such atrocious service  and utter disregard for its paying passengers.

We have never had any complaints with any actual flights and have given them high recommendations.  Then came COVID.  We were scheduled to fly out for a vacation, literally, the day lockdowns were imposed in March 2020.  Consequently, flights had to be canceled along with the entire trip.  Tried 2 more times in 2020 to take the same trip.  All, too, had to be canceled for some reason associated with COVID.  As a result of these 3 separate cancelations for flights of different costs, flight funds from the original trip got divided into 3 separate piles.  We were finally able to go on a trip in March 2021 and used part of those funds.  Just two weeks after getting back from that trip, we booked another trip for July 2021 to use another portion of our travel funds; however, they refused to extend that batch enough to allow us to fly in July with the money we had already spent.  Customer Service was absolutely blunt in their refusal and wouldn't even hear us out.  NONE of this mess was our fault and it certainly wasn't our desire to cancel one trip with Southwest, let alone 3!  COVID wasn't Southwest's fault either, but it would have been nice to have a little sympathy and consideration from a company wanting customers to come back after the Pandemic toward loyal customers who were actually trying to come back.  So much for everybody working together to get things running again!  Southwest may have ate my $414; but when we get off the plane from using our last batch of travel funds, the Rewards Cards are getting shredded and we'll never fly Southwest again.

I've encountered plenty of flight delays, missed connections, etc. & understand you normally just have to roll with the punches.  But yesterday in Charlotte with American Airlines was the worst travel experience/customer service I've ever had & I need to vent.Our group of 7 (2 others were smart/fortunate enough to be flying Delta home instead) had a connection home to Birmingham from CLT scheduled to leave around 6pm.  About 15 minutes before we were scheduled to start boarding, we received notification that our flight home was just outright cancelled (later found out due to maintenance).  And the next available flight to BHM they could put us on was at 10:20pm... THE NEXT NIGHT.So now we must wait in line at one of their Customer Service desks.  I tried calling instead, but phone wait time was 90-120 minutes (ended up getting that call back more like 3 hours later).  We ask about flights to other nearby cities... Huntsville, Montgomery or Atlanta.  There are 2 seats available to Huntsville flight about to leave just a couple gates over, so one couple is able to get onto that one, rent a car & make it home... leaving 5 of us left.The customer service lady (who was very pleasant btw) finds the rest of us a 6:11 Atlanta flight leaving shortly with plenty of room.  Problem is we are in Terminal E & that flight is in Terminal C, but she tells us if we get there by 10 minutes before (6:01), we will be good & that our boarding passes will be updated but it may take a few minutes.We literally sprint to that gate (I'm still winded) & we all get to the gate by 5:58 & the door is still open.  We're all well aware that if the door was already closed, we had no chance.  But our boarding passes on our phones haven't been updated to the correct flight yet.  There are 3 employees there that we explained our situation to; and not only were they not attempting to be helpful at all, they were just downright belligerent to all of us (there were actually 2 more people we didn't know in the same boat as us at the gate, too). Nobody is willing to even check for our names on the computer (I know they can look up passengers by their IDs) & the head power-hungry employee gets on the PA & announces ""This is the last call for all passengers on the flight to Atlanta.  I will be closing this door at the end of this announcement"" right as we were standing there and proceeds to do just that.Now I will admit, I lost my cool after that & expletives flew loudly (I could end up on someone's Youtube post); but we were not defiant or such up until that point.  We were trying to explain our situation that was American Airlines fault in the first place and not just us being late for a flight, but they wouldn't hear any of it. I can't even begin to put into words how badly we were treated at that gate.I've been on plenty of Southwest flights where we were delayed briefly while waiting on connecting passengers.  Sometimes it might be frustrating while you're on the plane, but it's good customer service.  This wasn't even requiring a flight be delayed.  This was just asking for an ounce of helpfulness, which was apparently too much to ask.So back to customer service desk we go.  There is one seat now open on a later flight to Birmingham; so we send our single flyer on her way home leaving 4 of us still at CLT.  Our only remaining flight option is another Atlanta flight leaving a couple hours later, but we'd still have to rent another car from there & didn't want to risk another cancelled or delayed flight due to ""maintenance.""So we make the decision to just rent a $450 one-way SUV & make the 5.5 hour drive home (Deep South is a pretty interesting newish Podcast btw), making it just before midnight.

0.9052,2021-06-01,2021-06-01,10.0,Be prepared to never make it to your destination,I will attempt to write this review with just the facts. Flight originally booked to leave out at 4pm from Cincinnati with an hour and half layover in Philadelphia. We were supposed to get into Boston Friday around 830pm. When the plane arrived a fire truck arrived shortly after and two fully equipped firemen board-not a great sign. This is still going on and the message on the screens still said we were boarding in 5 minutes and leaving on time. 15 minutes later we are told there will be an hour delay (5pm) At that point we knew we would not make our connecting flight. No big deal. We get in line to see what we can do. We were able to get on a later flight to Boston. They then tell us we are to leave at 6 but from a different gate. Therefore we all go to that gate. We are then told that this is a flight that was already set to go and it’s full. Therefore we all go back to the original gate and now the flight time is 630. When we get in line they told us that the time is wrong and he was 80% sure the flight won’t leave that night because “the wing is still smoking”. Okay....so we were able to get on the next available flight at 6am. We then leave and go to the ticketing booth and ask if they can get us a hotel room near by. With lots of attitude they say no because the delay was due to “weather”. I explained that in fact there was a fire truck and the wing was smoking therefore how is this weather related.  After about 45 minutes refusing to leave the line and asking to speak to the manager they finally agreed to pay for out hotel room. Okay great. Can we have our baby car seat back? Umm well....we can’t find it..... Okay (thank god we only did carry one-we met several people stranded without their luggage for the night) They graciously allow us to use a car seat for the night. We go back to the overnight parking and go to the hotel. Hotel staff states that the airlines did not provide the correct voucher information and “when we call them they are emotionally abusive to us”. After about 30 minutes waiting because the hotel staff needed to call the airlines to get the voucher for the room we finally make it to our room (930pm). We wake up around 4am and make it back to the airport. Everything is all great and ready to go. But WAIT the flight attendant who was just busy taking selfies of herself had a mini freak out because she just realized she left her wallet at the hotel. Flight is now leaving out at 630am. We finally did board knowing that we might get stranded in Philadelphia if any other delays happen (flight from Philly to Boston boards at 850am the only flight we can get on because there were no other flights leaving out Saturday from Boston)Thank god we made it. Ran from terminal F to C with only minutes to spare. Finally made it to our destination Saturday at 11am. Car seat is still missing-no idea where it went. Luckily we did not check our bags.,"{'neg': 0.069, 'neu': 0.853, 'pos': 0.078, 'compound': 0.9052}",0.9052
0.9052,2022-02-01,2022-02-01,30.0,"Beautiful planes and seats, but schedule has become unreliable","If you have been traveling for a long time, you may recall when we all welcomed the expansion of this little Texas airline. Getting future credits for self-canceling your flight, free checked baggage, friendly flight attendants (filled with humor), and the ability to bring your golf clubs and skiis was unheard of. In Minneapolis they took off from Terminal 2 which was new and much easier to navigate. I’m sure you are over-familiar with businesses closed during off peak times and other non-sense blamed on the COVID pandemic. You may recall just a couple years ago Southwest had to ground many of their brand new 737s on account on an auto-pilot software glitch which had taken down a couple on non-Southwest planes worldwide. For whatever reason Southwest has parlayed this into a reason to change your flight time to simply unreasonable changes such as from the morning to the afternoon. I was keeping my fingers crossed today when I booked (for my last time) two round trips for leisure hoping not to have to cancel again due to losing a day or two of vacation because of erratic changes. I’m not a big airline kind of guy; I swore I’d never fly American again after they stranded me in Miami and United when they changed a gate at the last minute and I missed the flight (amongst a million other transgressions). Things had been going great on Southwest for about ten years until the “switcheroo” flight changes. The downsides are getting to be too many wrestling for check in times and seats. The flight was delayed today for no explained reason. The plane was a brand new 737 and the flight crew was nice for the cattle call. Their prices are so cheap now that they are back to the Greyhound bus mentality where anything goes and no entertainment  or music. My suitcase took an merciless pounding and the outer pockets unzipped and shoes gone (TSA?). After these flights I will have used my dollars from previously canceled flights and my frequent flyer miles and calling it quits. Nice airline, inexpensive with nice seats, but unreliable schedules and cancellations.","{'neg': 0.032, 'neu': 0.894, 'pos': 0.074, 'compound': 0.9052}",0.9052

Now I’m out $2000 because of Southwest meltdown!,"Southwest, on Mon. 10/11, My partner and I got dropped off at PWM at 4:15am for a 5:30 flight to JAN via BWI. I was 40 miles from home. Ride gone.  Agent informs me my flight to BWI is canceled and they won’t be able to get us to Mississippi, not just for a day, but for four or five days!   Nothing out of any other airport within 300 miles. We never got a phone call, txt or anything about the cancelation! The agent even suggest we drive the 1400 miles. At first, agent lied and told us the plane didn’t get in the previous night from BWI. When I informed her that tracked it myself on Flightaware and confirmed it landed the night before, and physically saw the plane at the gate while coming off the highway, she then tried to tell me the crew timed out. Regardless, we weren’t getting there for almost five more days! Nothing could be done! Just a “sorry”We needed to be there on Wednesday morning for an important function! We had expensive prepaid non refundable hotel rooms, another $400 prepaid rental car due to be picked up in Jackson that afternoon.  Had I not made it, I would have lost all that prepaid reservations, too! We scrambled, and had to buy to last minute tickets on Delta  for $950 each! Plus, $80 to race over across town to catch a bus to Boston, 3 hours ride away, for a 10:00am flight! Particularly stressing, as I was just laid off from my job! But I had to make this trip! People depending on me to be there! Had no choice but to spend almost $1900 dollars to get where I needed to be!  I felt like I got robbed! We were on hold with Southwest Reservations three hours to Boston until we lost phone battery, Delta got us to JAN a few hours later than planned. We tried calling Southwest for two days, but gave up trying to call  about refunds after the first two days. We would call and have the automated answering service telling us it wowas an 8-15 hours on hold! Now we’re hearing Southwest is giving folks like us a “Goodwill Gesture” $250 travel voucher? No thanks! That’s a joke!  We want our $600 back in full at minimum. Our $1360 extra costs to buy new tickets with DL would be a nicer Goodwill gesture.  We’re not going to be using a voucher anytime soon after this, and without a refund we’re out $2000 to fly two people from Maine to Mississippi. We could have gone to Hawaii for that rate! When delays are not a day or two, but up to five days later, you guys need to start paying to rebook folks on other flights who are counting to get somewhe I’ve had to wait over a week until we just got home tonight because I haven’t had time to be on hold during my travels for 8+hours!

All the best cleaning efforts were for naught as I had to sit in a seat occupied by another passenger until he was moved.

I am a physician and I was trying to get back to work (trying to help all those in need during this ruthless pandemic and then some) with my service dog. She is certified and has all her paperwork. Needless to say I was stopped at the gate before getting into the plane and told to step aside so that the staff could review my dogs paperwork.. I showed them her papers and they told me that they did not have any information about my dog and for that reason I could not get on the plane.. let’s start here1. My dog is 11 years old and has been traveling with me since she was born. So I am well aware of the rules and for the first 3 years of her life I paid for all her flights since at that time I did not need her as a service dog.2. In this situation I was told that I did not Pre-register my dog prior to my flight.. two points for this. — on the American Airlines website itself it reports that emotional support dogs need a 48 hour notice before their flights and that service dogs themselves do not need Pre-registration ( fine and dandy) — despite not needing to register my service dog I still called American one week prior to my flight and let SEC know I would be flying with her and I was told everything was in order. Well let’s keep going.. while standing in front of my gate the staff was extremely rude to me and told me they were going to close the gate on me since my dog was not in the system (again, not necessary since she is a service dog and not an emotional support dog). I attempted to call customer service and I was blatantly told they did not want to take the call. Can you believe that?They closed the gate on me and didn’t even offer to try to reschedule my flight for a later time or try to accommodate anything for something that was very clearly not my fault. I ended up having to drive 4 hours in a rental car in order to make it to the urgent care where I work. I worked my 8 hour shift, saw my 50 patients and wrote an email to customer service explaining my situation and how disrespectfully I was treated during the entire situation. The following day I received a phone call from an agent. She apologized and proceeded to tell me that it was basically my fault since my dog does not qualify as a service dog and that I did not call in advance ( when I did and my call log proves it). Also, my dog 100% qualifies as a service dog and it can be proved with paperwork ( however, it is my right to confidentiality and specifics are not required). I expressed to them what service my dog provides me and that is all they are allowed to ask of me legally. Yet despite this information she continued to tell me my dog did not qualify as a service god and that someone would contact me to ask further questions. Well that was 11 days ago and I have yet to hear from anyone since then. I wrote another email to customer service and again have yet to hear from them. Bottom line: I was disgusted by the way I was treated that day despite me doing everything correctly and speaking to all of them with the respect any human being deserves (regardless of how they treated me). Not only is American Airlines not keeping their word on social distancing ( no skipped seats and still filling the plane front to back) but they are also terrible at customer service, rude to their loyal clients (I’ve been using them for many years), and ruthless when it comes to extending a helping hand particularly in these times of need.","{'neg': 0.028, 'neu': 0.912, 'pos': 0.06, 'compound': 0.9186}",0.9186

The airline earned my loyalty with its comfortable and reliable in-flight product and exceptional customer service. I have frequently paid more and tolerated awkward routings to fly on Delta because I felt they offered a superior product.Sadly, everything that drew me to Delta seems to be collapsing. I have completed five roundtrips with the airline in 2021, and significant failures affected all but one of them. This review would be far too long if I were to document each issue. The list includes frequent (sometimes weekly) schedule changes to upcoming itineraries, massive delays, cancellations, and misconnects (two of which resulted in unplanned overnight stays), and long hold times, even on the Platinum customer service line.Just this morning, I discovered that two segments of a trip to Maui later this year no longer exist. Delta's website tells me not to worry, they have rebooked me on other flights, but they have not. As that itinerary now stands, I will get to Salt Lake City with no connection to Maui. I tried calling the Platinum Elite customer service line. There's a 40-minute wait to speak with someone.In contrast to these experiences, I've been on Southwest Airlines four times since January. All flights have been flawless, with no unexpected schedule changes or delays. I have two more flights with them over the next couple of weeks. In both instances, Delta flights would have been substantially more expensive. I prefer the upscale experience Delta offers, but for now, Southwest seems to be much better at getting me from point A to point B in a hassle-free and reasonably comfortable manner.That brings me to my final point. I have a hunch that most travelers like me are looking for an airline that provides dependable transportation, an upscale in-flight experience, and exceptional customer service for the rare instances when something goes awry. Delta's CEO, Ed Bastian, and the company's Board of Directors seem to have lost their way. The decline in Delta's travel product has been accompanied by a noticeable upswing in Mr. Bastian's public statements about politics and an effort to evangelize customers on progressive causes. Rome is burning, and the corporate leadership seems to think they are running a policy institute or advocacy coalition rather than an airline. They appear more intent on preaching to their customers about politics and social issues than providing a fantastic travel product for all patrons.As both a Delta customer and a Delta shareholder, I'm deeply disappointed in my airline. I have resisted switching to Southwest because I prefer Delta's product, but I sense the time has come to make a move.","{'neg': 0.049, 'neu': 0.881, 'pos': 0.071, 'compound': 0.9217}",0.9217

0.9225,2021-04-01,2021-04-01,10.0,Dishonesty at its finest!,"Writing this review to express my disgust at the dishonesty of this airline.  In April of 2020, during the COVID pandemic I booked a flight for a family wedding.  When I booked the flight Delta had a ""flight special"" that offered up tickets at a very inexpensive price and also they stated that if the flight had to be cancelled the original ticket price would be honored at face value with no fees or increase in ticket price.  When I booked the flight, I confirmed this offer with the Delta Rep and would not have booked the flight had this not been the case. In May of 2020 the flight had to be cancelled and when I attempted to call Delta Customer service I was placed on hold for 3 hours.  Over the course of the next few days I continued to make attempts to contact Delta only to find wait times were 3 to 4 hours or more.  Due to this, I contacted Delta through Facebook Messenger.  I received a message back from Patrick cancelling the flight, and at that time I was able to confirm with Patrick in writing that in fact yes that the flight  could be rebooked at a later date with the original ticket price being honored and that I there would be an ""even exchange"" when I went to re-book the flight. In 2021 with the wedding back on I attempted to book the flight only to find that the e-codes provided were invalid.  I then called the booking  number to then be told that in fact that no my tickets would not be honored unless I paid the current fee, which was more than $300.00 more than the original price I had paid for the tickets - this despite the fact that I had it in writing that the original ticket price would be honored as an ""even exchange"". The booking agent stated I would have to call customer service in order to lodge a complaint.After several days of waiting on hold for three hours or more I finally gave up and filed a complaint with the Department of Transportation.  DOT passed my complaint on to Delta who basically responded that they would not honor their promise to honor the ticket price.  So essentially they lied to me and in all probability lied to other trusting customers as well.So...buyer beware.  This is a company that uses dishonesty as its best policy as a means of scamming customers.","{'neg': 0.074, 'neu': 0.826, 'pos': 0.1, 'compound': 0.9225}",0.9225

Overall, we had an OK experience; I felt it was somewhat below the standard I expect from Delta.The check-in line at ORD was very long; not enough agents were working.  The agent who assisted with check-in was not rude, but also not especially friendly, unusual for Delta.  I did appreciate that they had hand sanitizer dispensers throughout the check-in line.Our visit to the Delta SkyClub at ORD impressed; they are doing a great job with the clubs during COVID-19, maintaining a nice selection of food that is now served entirely in self-service containers.  It’s an environmental nightmare in-terms of single-use plastics, but I appreciated that they maintained service levels in the lounge. Guests were adequately distanced; the lounge was not busy.Our gate agent at ORD was awful.  She was in a bad mood.  She forgot to process the upgrade list until reminded.  She did not offer any pleasantries during the boarding process.  And, worst of all, despite all of the signage reminding passengers to wear their masks, etc., she wore hers below her chin.Onboard personnel were much better.  However, onboard service was extremely limited:  basically, water, wine, or beer.  Coffee was not on-offer; it was a bit hard to figure out what would make serving a cup of coffee in a paper cup a COVID-19 problem.  First class passengers were offered a snack box, which was a nice gesture, but it was full of processed snacks rather than fresh food.The A220 is a nice airplane and was sparkling clean; the entertainment screen was large and the selection robust.  However, the design of the first class seats was idiotic; the armrest between seats runs all the way to the floor, meaning that there was almost zero under seat storage for either passenger.  That was fine on this flight, since first class was half-full due to Delta’s seat blocking policy.  However, on a full flight during normal times, this would be very annoying for anyone carrying a briefcase.Overall, for Delta, a disappointing experience.","{'neg': 0.11, 'neu': 0.743, 'pos': 0.148, 'compound': 0.9276}",0.9276

First the good points, check-in Indianapolis was quick and easy, but perhaps that's because I arrived at the airport 2 hours early. The other positive was how quickly the bags appeared on the carousel at my destination--usually the  wait at Bradley is LONG. But, the flight had been delayed arriving after midnight, so I guess the baggage handlers were as ready as the rest of us to go homeNow for the not so good:1. At check-in as a Business Select customer, I was given a ""ticket"" for a free beer, wine or cocktail. Southwest is not serving alcohol even with these tickets. I had flown American first-class into Indianapolis, and ""yes"" I was able to get my Bloody Mary on American.2. This flight had 2 ""legs"".  On the first Indy to BWI, I was A7 and on BWI to Bradley, I was A1. I understand that those in wheelchairs and others with  disabilities are allowed to pre-board. Well, not only were these people pre-boarded, but so were apparently healthy college-age individuals and people with school-age children (though usually they board between the A & B groups).3. Once boarded, we sat at least 15 minutes before we were told that the plane was waiting for other passengers. Then, after they boarded, we had to wait for their bags to be loaded. Total wait time was at least 40 minutes. 4. On the initial ""leg"", there was soft-drink service. On the final leg, the flight attendant--not the captain--announced that due to ""expected"" turbulence there would be no drink service. Strange that this announcement didn't come from the cockpit.  Not only was there no drink service, there was no turbulence.I intend to inform SWA of these issues, and that unless absolutely necessary, I will never fly SWA again. Business Select was expensive and while I was at the head of the A Boarding Groups, so many people were allowed to pre-board, that I might as well have saved my money.","{'neg': 0.048, 'neu': 0.868, 'pos': 0.084, 'compound': 0.928}",0.928

Staff was great, none of this is their fault and shouldn't affect them. This is just bad planning and airline practices. I won't use a service I can't rely on, as I do not have time to spare when making plans.

After giving our details the gentleman made the purchase without any consent of the purchase being made at that moment or anything. My husband had to look at our account to see that money had been taken after asking the gentleman why would he not notify us he then proceeds to say that he never really took our son into account(put him in the system) and now he need to make a separate purchase because he infants does need a seat and that any 2 and up has to pay for a seat, although in a previous conversation he had said 2 and under. Not once did he apologize for charging our card without approval nor for neglecting to tell us our child did need a seat at the time of purchase when being told originally that he didn’t. We are in the holiday season when tickets can be pricey and I feel that we should’ve been given a option as to which airline would accommodate us better instead our money was taken and now we have to week 7-10 business days to get the money back and by then all the airline seats will be sold out or higher due to this inconvenience. I asked to speak with a supervisor and was switched to a department without briefing them of my case and without any notations being place on my account. And the Supervisor didn’t help either it was either get a refund or pay full price for my sons ticket(a seat that he will not sit in) no discount, no taxes dropped for making me have to do two purchases when being asked if 4 tickets needed to be purchased and/or no comped seat for the child.

Our gate was displayed twenty minutes before takeoff - a B gate - last call was promptly announced, so we had to sprint back to security and out the other side, through duty free etcetera, a further significant distance, to find seated passengers and yet more waiting for a bus to the plane.

Giving us options for a couple of flights, if we needed more time to return, as not to miss our flight.(Of course, we took option #1, the first flight out/ less amenities, we were desperate to return, but the options were great)...He gave us a Taxi vouchers... Set us up, with a voucher to rest/wait at a beautiful 4 star hotel in Dallas!

I've been to many other airports and their security often makes you feel rushed they are moving you through so quickly and efficiently. Denver Airport security was molasses slow. Lots of standing around waiting for your bin to enter the scan device and then waiting again on the other side of the body scan for your bin to complete its scan. So slow! After I went through the whole process I saw 2 main items that would help speed up the process at Denver Airport: 1) Automated return of security bins. Security checkpoints at other airports have automated bin returns which really speed things up. At the faster airports there is a worker feeding them into an automated bin return and they are quickly made available at the start of the line. Denver Airport had workers using very inefficient carts with bad mobility. My daughter and I couldn't help chuckling at a worker that was slowly navigating a cart with a stack of bins bumping into doors and other items as she struggled to slowly steer the cart from the end of the line back to the start. 2) Have travelers separate out items into different bins with no layers for security scan. Security checkpoints at other airports have you place your electronics in separate bins with now layer/piling of items on top of each other. For example, in Seattle they have you remove your laptop(s) from your bag. Same for your cell phone and bags of liquids. At Denver Airport they had everyone place everything in one tray each all piled on top of each other. Goo grief! No wonder the guy looking at the scanner had to stare at the screen for ages! It took forever. Extremely inefficient and slow for no good reason. Whomever is in charge of security at Denver Airport should take a trip to some other airports and pick up some efficiency improvement ideas. It would go a long way in getting travelers through their security area more quickly. The would also likely need fewer security stations, less equipment and fewer security workers. Aside from the slowness and inefficiency at security, the rest of the experience was fine. There was some construction, but it didn't disrupt our ability to get from point A to point B.","{'neg': 0.036, 'neu': 0.87, 'pos': 0.094, 'compound': 0.9367}",0.9367

My meetings ended much early so I called the Platinum desk to see what earlier flights there might be, and they told me to go to the airport, which was where they should be able to make the change (any earlier flight was ""wide open"" for space). I have 2.5 million miles and lifetime Platinum status with the airline. Once at the airport upon check in the gate agent could not help even after checking with a supervisor because of their policy to not change flights, even though the earlier flight was ""wide open"" in terms of space, as it was company ""Policy"". She did suggest I try at the ""special services"" desk near my anticipated gate for the earlier flight. Their the gentlemen with a cold stare told me I would have to wait for the later flight, because he was unable to make the change because of ""policy"", unless I paid the $390 (more than my entire trip) change fee to get on a plane that was ""wide open"". He also informed me I would need to call the agent that booked it for me. I called the agent who asked me why American had not put me on stand by with my Platinum status. I had already asked the same question. The agent made the change for $250, and then when I went to the gate to get my new ticket, they informed me he had not processed the payment which I know had happened, and would not listen to the booking travel agent on the speaker phone, as they constantly interrupted him. So with minutes to spare he issued me a one-way ticket and then he sorted it out with American Airlines the next day. They of course were in error. So tomorrow I am flying back to Orlando, and once again my day will be ending earlier than anticipated. But today American Airlines has my original flight for tomorrow oversold, and wants to know if I would move to another flight. AMAZING HOW THEY CAN NOW MAKE THE CHANGE IN POLICY WHEN IT WORKS FOR THEM. I am disgusted with not just the policy, but with how a number of desk agents at the Orlando airport treated me. Even the supervisor would not hear me out at ""Special Services""... this department should be call ""Stick to Policy"" unless of course it might help out American Airlines. Forget about helping a customer who has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on flights. I do have to commend the flight crew who were very friendly. I had stopped using American for a while because of bad service, and since moving to Orlando I thought I would give them another chance. Well needless to say, I guess I will avoid the flights again with American. If this is how they treat someone who has flown a lot with them, I cannot imagine how they treat casual travelers.I have tried to submit compliments and complaints to American Airlines in the past, and have never heard back from them.

I originally booked an AA Vacation package to NYC for a 4-day trip, COVID hit, rebooked, trip postponed again, all travel put on hold.  Rebooked roundtrip, business class to Rome and return.  Had to book 3 days before cruise because of AA Vacation requirements.  After two flight changes I received a notice that my flight was changed a third time, this time just the type of aircraft.  When I went online to make sure I had the seat I reserved, there was no seat assigned to me and no business class seats available.  I called, was told oh, sorry, we will have to put you on a different flight.  They could keep me on the flight I had in coach, which was not acceptable as I fly business for specific reasons.  To keep departure from Rome and arrival into Phoenix about the same due to my daughter and her friend being on the original flight I had, I had to book British Airways.  To get a business class seat on their flights that would avoid having someone step over me or my having to step over someone else, I paid right at $200 to pick my seat. Well today I check online and my original flights are for sale again on AA with business class seats available.  I called, thinking they would put me back on my original flight.  But oh no, I was told that I was the ""lowest class"" of business class and I would have to pay the difference because they only had the ""upper class"" available.  Talk about being made to feel like a second-rate citizen!!!I have been flying American Airlines for as long as I have been taking trips (and that is a long, long time) ... but I will find other airlines to fly from now on.   Why is it that I have to pay some $3000 extra to get on a flight in the class that I originally paid for because AA decided to change the type of aircraft and not give me a seat, but now that they have seats available, I'm ""lower class"" and cannot be put on that flight.  It is not like there is a section of business that is different or offset from the rest of the cabin.  Total disrespect for customers by the people I spoke with today.  I have other trips in the works and will find other airlines to fly to points either inside or outside the U.S.  I may use my AA FF miles to fly into a connecting airport to fly other airlines.  It will be worth the effort of having to pick up my luggage and recheck just to fly on an airline that treats its customers with some respect.

EVERY flight had every seat filled.  Their procedures are no different from prior to the virus.  They have ZERO hand sanitizing stations in their boarding area. They boarded the flights in groups.  Groups 1-5 had about 15% of the flight. Group 6 Had about 60% of the passengers all cramming to get on board like the plane was going to leave them.  One of the flight attendants was sniffling and wheezing, I cant say she was infected BUT... Sure looked it.  REALLY?  My Opinion.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS AIRLINE!!!!","{'neg': 0.071, 'neu': 0.798, 'pos': 0.131, 'compound': 0.9413}",0.9413

And I believe i ended that review with them loosing our luggage. The staff at the lost baggage claim In Miami tried their best to track it down. For 6 hours we waited as they called and had people looking for it. But no luck. We were put in a jet to fly back to Des Moines. We then sat for 30 plus minutes waiting again....... for what this time oh the pilot! Finally after being cramped in farthest back seats, you know the ones that don’t recline we were finally on our way. Not to the warm beaches of Roatan but back to our home state where it was 18°! But that’s not where this review ends. They had the heat so high in the jet we were sweating and my poor wife spent the entire trip in the planes bathroom vomiting! Heat and motion sickness got her. She said the bathroom was cooler. So we spent 23hours traveling either on American Airlines or in the airport just to come back home all because they couldn’t wait for for 5 minutes. Thanks for that American Airlines.On a positive note, the Lost baggage people at both Miami and Des Moines were very nice. The flight attendant on the Des Moines flight home was also a saint, she was guarding the bathroom and helping customers to get to the first class bathroom.

We were scheduled to leave at 6 am and never left Phoenix until 7pm that night. When we checked in they did a ticket exchange with American Airlines for a one way to LAx to then connect us on a delta flight to our final destination. They allowed only 45 minutes for us to travel out of the terminal and back through security to board a delta flight in one of the largest airports. Completely unacceptable. (I was with my elderly mom) I knew we would not make it and I tried calling delta but couldn’t get ahold of them as they had a 4 hour wait time for assistance and being in a different terminal no customer care desk. I ended up going to the American Airlines counter and they were more than willing to assist me and booked me a direct flight to Spokane. Finally got there after a 14 hour day traveling. Originally booked with delta for the seat space with the pandemic but ended up being packed full in the American Airlines flight. Even contacting delta customer care after our trip ended and voiced my concerns. They could care less. They had no sense of customer first nor did they care that I could possibly be a returning customer. Flight attendants are rude and inconsiderate. No empathy with customers.  I understand Mother Nature and the weather delays but the airlines same issues year after year and never change. They have you in between a rock and a hard spot  and they either wanna help you or not. They could care less if I make it to my destination. I will never travel with delta again- gave them a last chance on the customer care center. P.s. had to pay for double baggage fees because they booked us on 2 airlines.

And then it took about 30 minutes to get to the car rental terminal.

That meant I had to wait for them to land and get off the plane. My plan was to park and go inside to help them with their luggage and the babies. But since I had no idea where to go before they landed, I barely was able to even get to the correct terminal and gate before they were trying to collect baggage by themselves - 2 babies and a mom. There is no meaningful signage to direct a person to car rental return location. And I asked 3 different employees how to get there - 2 Terminal Link drivers and a TSA agent who just happened to be on his lunch break, thank goodness. The 2 Terminal Link drivers had no idea. The TSA agent said he was pretty sure I would have to exit the airport then turn around. He thought the car rental return location was only outside the airport. Considering I had been driving around for what seemed like a lifetime, I did as he recommended. But the signs only said rentals, not car rental return. I followed this sign and ended up in front of the car rental terminal, not the right place. At first the Hertz agents tried to direct me to get back in their vehicle and drive somewhere else. I lost it. The agents then whispered to themselves - probably deciding if they needed the men to bring the white suits - but then one of them agreed to look at the vehicle and drive it to the correct location herself.

I hardly take trips, so I opted for a more expensive ticket (Comfort), because I'm not ready for First Class yet. However, I want to be comfortable on a long trip . I understood that I couldn't cancel after 24 hours of reservation, so I had to commit to the Comfort and trust that I deserve the experience. Yesterday, I received a notification that my flight had been changed. Delta didn't just change the time, they changed the dates of our trip to arrive a day earlier and depart a day later than our plans. Thus, extending our trip from a 5-day to a 7-day travel, in another country... Yes! this is an international trip. I haven't been on an international trip since 2001!!! I planned my childcare, work/appointments and arrangements on this trip. So imagine my nerves of an impromptu change. I called Delta. The line said it'll be a 30 minute wait for the next available representative. It was 8:00 am.  I selected the callback option...I didn't get a callback until 9:20...The rep looked up the details and basically explained that no concessions can be made for the inconvenience. However, we could cancel our trips and get a refund if we like. Here's the issue: The company made changes to a reservation for a flight that an agent sold to me. I reserved mine with a Delta agent directly.  Then, we get a notification that states Delta changed it. They didn't ask, give options or anything. This is my first time in Mexico. Our flight schedules  were solely made based on the accommodations we had for this trip. Now, Delta extends the trip and I have to figure everything else out. We either have to pay for 2 extra days of accommodations,  in Mexico, or cancel our trip and HOPE they give us our money back- NOT IN CREDIT.

0.9461,2021-07-01,2021-07-01,20.0,Delta: Left hand has no clue what the right hand is doing!,"My wife and I had RT reservations from Tucson to Guadalajara leaving in a couple of days and returning at a later date. Going to Guadalajara we were to fly Tucson to Salt Lake City to Guadalajara. Returning to Tucson we were to fly Guadalajara to Atlanta to Tucson.Last night (July 17) I happened to open my Delta phone app to see when my flight check in could occur. I noticed a bunch of red mouse text which I could not make out. I logged onto the Delta website from my desktop and discovered Delta had changed their schedule on the Atlanta to Tucson flight such that we would land in Atlanta around 6:30PM but miss our Atlanta to Tucson flight.I called the number referenced in the mouse print and eventually got through to a Delta rep. Essentially I was told we would have to spend the night in Atlanta and fly back to Tucson the next morning. I asked about a flight from Guadalajara to Los Angeles to Tucson that arrived to Tucson between 4PM and 5 PM on the same day but the flight from Guadalajara to Los Angeles would require us to leave too early to get to the airport in Guadalajara on time. Our option was the layover in Atlanta. I asked the rep if Delta would cover our hotel expense and was told to “ask for a voucher” when we arrived at Atlanta. However, it was not clear who I was supposed to ask! Also, we would be on this trip for quite a while and each had 2 checked bags that we wanted to check with Delta in Guadalajara and pick up in Tucson when we arrived. I specifically mentioned I did not want to have to deal with 4 bags that we would have to take to the hotel and then repeat the process the next morning on our way back to the Atlanta airport. I was told our bags would be checked in from Guadalajara all the way to Tucson.This morning (July 18) I went to the Delta Facebook page to see if I could get some clarification on what I was told the night before. I eventually had a messenger conversation with a Delta rep. This person I was chatting with said “I apologize for the schedule change. We do not offer hotel vouchers for schedule changes.” When I asked about the Guadalajara-Los Angeles-Tucson flight with the first part on Aero Mexico I was told “unfortunately there is not another flight option. We are not able to reprotect on Aeromexico. I am sorry you were given mis-information. As a goodwill gesture I can offer you each a $100 voucher towards your next flight” I responded that I did not want a voucher for a future flight since I had no intention of flying Delta in future. I asked to escalate my conversation to a supervisor and was told “I am a supervisor. I'm sorry you were told that, we are not able to reprotect on AeroMexico. I see hotels start at $80 a night. To compensate for the incorrect information I can take off $150 off of your ticket only. This is a one time offer, we do not normally offer this. This is an exception since we can not offer a hotel voucher.” The Delta rep then said “The original connection is no longer operating. Unfortunately all flights returning to TUS will be a forced overnight. Can you return to PHX instead?” I told the rep that Phoenix was more than 120 miles from my home. I asked the rep to give me a few minutes to talk to my wife about the Phoenix option and to see what additional expense we would incur. The flight from Atlanta to Phoenix did not arrive until close to 11PM and we would have to rent a car one way to drive home the next morning after spending the night in Phoenix instead of Atlanta. The rental rate and hotel stay would have cost about $240. I got back to the Delta rep and asked if the $150 offer would be available with the Phoenix option. I was told “The $150 is to cover the hotel expense since you were told incorrect information on hotel compensation. If you choose the ATL to PHX flight the $150 would not apply.” When I pointed out we would have to spend the night in Phoenix because of the late arrival time, I was told “Unfortunately since the flight arrives on the same day… I can not authorize to cover a hotel in PHX”So, I told the rep to leave all flights as is and to not change us to the PHX option. The rep never got back to me to confirm my desire to leave things as is with the Atlanta overnight.I then called the same phone number I called last night (July 17) and eventually spoke to a Delta rep who apologized profusely for the flight schedule change. I mentioned to him that when we purchased the tickets (first time we ever flew first class) we were scheduled to be back to Tucson at 10:34 in the evening where a neighbor was going to pick us up. I mentioned we did not want to spend a night in Atlanta and he agreed. I asked him about the Guadalajara-Los Angeles-Tuscon flight I had spoken to the previous two Delta reps about and he said he would speak to his supervisor about changing us to that option. It took about thirty minutes while I was on hold BUT he was able to change us to the AeroMexico flight from Guadalajara to Los Angeles then the Delta flight from Los Angeles to Tucson. So much for the veracity of the Delta supervisor’s information I was given during our messenger chat which indicated the AeroMexico flight was not an option.So in the end we are happy to NOT have to spend an uncompensated night on the road because of Delta’s schedule change and we actually get home about 5 hours earlier than our original schedule. However, I am not happy about the fact that I spent almost 4 hours of my time dealing with an issue that should have been resolved without having to speak to three different Delta reps. Instead of having a rep tell me all the things Delta couldn’t or wouldn’t do for one of their customers, I had a final experience that graciously resolved our issue and might change my mind about flying Delta in future.","{'neg': 0.027, 'neu': 0.937, 'pos': 0.037, 'compound': 0.9461}",0.9461

I waited in line and approached the desk, apologizing and asking if I could please have a disposable mask. He said yes and reached in his drawer, asking if I was flying American, to which I said no. He then handed me the mask and asked again, more aggressively, to which again I said I was not flying American, but thank you for the paper mask. He reached back over and ripped the mask out of my hand, saying i can’t have their mask unless I’m flying their airline, and told me to go somewhere else. It was startling, and very patronizing, as well as disrespectful to basics COVID guidelines we’re required to follow. Before this experience, I flew American several weeks prior, where I witnessed a flight attendant yell at an elderly man actively eating to put his mask on. The same attendant also yelled at the parent of a small child playing with their mask. For an airline that so clearly aggressively treats mask wearing and customers, they also seem to disregard public health unless you’re paying them.

The following is a copy-paste original piece clearly brushed off by Delta Airlines. To whom this may concern, the following is my experience regarding my trip from Denver, CO to the island of Sint Maarten on May 3rd, 2021. My initial flight was lovely, however I when I landed in Atlanta, GA for my layover I arrived at 12:00 am in an absolutely empty Atlanta airport. Not a single soul was in my concourse, I was completely alone. Now I understand under the current circumstances with the pandemic the first class lounge remains closed during late hours. Nonetheless, I sat in that airport for 7 hours waiting for the lounge to open up at 7:00 am, and I cannot emphasize nor deliberate how run down this concourse was. Seats were falling apart, outlets were a joke, and there was nothing at all to eat, or drink for 7 hours. The previous flight gave me a some upscale snacks, but that was it. I know that this is uncontrollable by the airline, but this simply serves to paint the picture of my situation. At 7:00 am, I walk into the lounge and stand in line at the counter. Please keep in mind, I have changed at this point, and was in my leisure outfit. When I get the counter, I met a gentleman that clearly ""read"" my appearance, and already decided I did not belong in the lounge. Regardless, I booked a first class flight in anticipation of overnight travel and yet when I spoke with him, he reminded me of some silly policy. Apparently flights to the Caribbean or Mexico do not have Delta 1 on the airplanes sent there, and thus I was illegible. So my question to you is, who's fault is that? All I know is, I spent almost 900 dollars on a one way flight, comforted by the fact that I was flying Delta, who are known for their service. One walk of shame later from that counter, I was wronged and your reputation tarnished. At the very least, one would expect you to make this policy well known before another individual like myself books an overnight flight in such a rundown airport like Atlanta.  At 9:30 am, I boarded my flight and we then moved on to sit on the tarmac for 3 hours. Apparently there was an issue related to the windows of the cockpit of plane, and thus we deplaned at 12:30 pm. 3 hours later, we boarded again, took off at 4 pm, and the staff did a phenomenal job. I could not have been more thrilled with them and their attitude. To summarize, I took me over 28 hours to arrive to my destination, in an entirely hellish fashion. I had high but reasonable expectations of your airline, and you treated me with utter disrespect. I am a medical student, and I have had to answer to multiple people for my delay, and have yet to make up missed commitments. And for this experience, I was rewarded $275 in mileage, as though expecting me to fly with the airline again. I am a very tolerant individual, but all things considered, judgements included, I believe further action is required of you. I am grateful for the corporate sentiment, but frankly speaking it feels as though my experience was a joke brushed off as unimportant.  I have been besides myself for not have writing to you earlier, but again I am a student, with other much more important responsibilities than submitting a complaint to a veteran airline. Nonetheless I demand respect, and to be treated with dignity.","{'neg': 0.068, 'neu': 0.833, 'pos': 0.098, 'compound': 0.948}",0.948

I don't think the process is intuitive. When you choose another flight, a price is listed, but a passenger typically would think this was an additional cost. Nowhere (that I could find) is the amount of credit from the original ticket shown. (This did eventually come up, but not until I'd taken a chance and clicked on a fare). Also, I couldn't find a way to exit without choosing seats...and therein lies the rub.There were two passengers on the itinerary. I captured the one available seat ""at no extra charge,"" but then the only remaining seats had a $30 up-charge. Since I recently spent 2-1/2 hours on hold with Delta (and never got through), I paid up. Then, we arrived at the airport. The seat reservations had been canceled and we were reassigned seats. The good news--they were together. The bad news--neither seat was a Comfort Plus, for which I'd paid $30 extra. I asked the gate agent and he said they were both Comfort Plus. (He lied). As soon as we boarded, it was obvious they were not premium seats. I asked the flight attendant and she confirmed they weren't Comfort Plus. She said she would check with the gate agent...and that's the last we saw of her for the entire trip. I don't really blame her, because every seat on the flight was filled. However, changing the flight and then reassigning seats were both done by computer, and Delta could easily fix both.I'm aware that I can ask Delta to refund the $30, but with all of the issues I experienced, I'm not going to bother. They will only issue e-refunds (with an expiration date) and I have no plans to go anywhere that Delta flies. I wouldn't even have flown Delta this time (because of their woke policies) if I'd had any other reasonable choice...but that's a whole 'nother story. I'm not saying I'll never fly Delta again, but given a choice...I won't.","{'neg': 0.046, 'neu': 0.857, 'pos': 0.097, 'compound': 0.95}",0.95

First off American doesn’t block center seats. I understand the unit economics don’t work long term with this model but if you’re going to take government (taxpayers) money then you can block the seats during COVID until things start to get back to some resemblance of normal. Secondly, if you can’t even do that at least hand out sanitizing wipes so passengers can clean down their area. This little gesture would have even gone a long way. Delta not only blocked their middle seats but also handed out sanitizing wipes. There is a reason why Delta’s stock and market cap surpasses American and it’s because they genuinely care more about customer service. I’m had status with American for years (and have been flying them most of my life) since growing up near Philly (US Airways). It’s time to switch.

I went from LAX to Peru then Panama to Cancun then Phoenix to Ontario. For this trip I used 3 different airlines a mixture of price and convenience. EVERY person I told American Airlines to (AA) said “they’re horrible”. I asked why. Almost every response was “they always have delays”. I don’t always take this data as face value. I will try things for myself, and then form an opinion. I kept my flights, didn’t change anything. I left Cancun Mexico, flying AA. I was able to upgrade my seat, very expensive but the flight was comfortable and everything went smooth. They mentioned a promotion about their credit card to earn flying miles immediately. I did not take the offer on my first flight, but I was seriously considering getting it on this next flight. I was going to make American Airlines my primary source of flying. I land in Phoenix Arizona, go through customs, hot foot to my terminal to catch my AA connected flight, and guess what… it’s delayed! My flight was supposed to leave at 7:20pm. Look at the time stamp on this review. It’s after 9pm. They have an estimated time of 10:45pm, but they can’t tell us an approximate time. Garbage. If management, or executives can answer these questions, who can? Insane! As a business owner, I can answer everything! As a traveler, I have had delays. I’ve just never seen a sure thing. If you want to win a bet, bet that American Airlines will be late. Will have delays. Will NOT be able to give straight answers. And no one will know anything. I’ve flown Latam, Delta, southwest, Volaris, United, Skywest and others. I WILL choose anyone of these over AA moving forward. Way to prove everyone right AA. I don’t blame the innocent men and women that work for this company. They were not in charge of it, and they don’t make calls. I one hundred percent blame Executives and Management. I am really upset that people I spoke with prior, were right. I enjoy proving people wrong, but in this case it makes it very difficult. My time is very important to me. It is the only thing I cannot get back. I can make more money, I can have more children, I can do many things. But I can’t get my most valuable asset back which is time. American Airlines does not Seem to care about this. I could be wrong. Let’s see if any upper management or executive has the courage to reach out to me and make this better. Obviously I am not investing in the American Airlines credit card anymore.

I was traveling for an unexpected event and needed a last minute flight. American Airlines was the cheapest so I decided I would go against what the reviews said and trust them. I deeply regret it. The first leg of the flight was 45 minutes late to take off, despite being boarded on time. To make matters worse, this is Southern California where it is almost 100 degrees outside and the ac on the plane isn’t working. Which would not have been a problem except that they made us sit in the plane on the tarmac for 45 minutes when it was 100°F. I was just glad I’d payed a little more with the flight that didn’t have a 35 minute layover because I would have missed my flight.

At the time the flight was supposed to leave, the plane we were supposed to be on had not even arrived and yet they had made no announcement of any kind that there was going to be a delay.

The flight ended up being an hour late.I give 2 stars because while it was a terrible experience, all of the flight attendants and gate staff were pleasant and helpful as they could be and I understand it is not the customer service people’s fault that their airline is terrible at following their own schedule.Overall it was not a good time and I can safely say I would not recommend American Airlines to anyone who does not want to deal with delays.

We arrived with 3 hours before departure but neednt have worried. Travelling to Warsaw on LO282, our check in was completed online 24 hrs before. The check in area was quiet and we walked straight up to the kiosk to print our luggage tags. After issuing the tags, the kiosk printed paper boarding passes without any prompt - trying to save paper, we had already got our passes on our mobile phones. Would advise airlines to check if passengers need a paper pass at the kiosk. Once our luggage was tagged, we walked straight over to a drop off desk. In the past, there would be a queue, but given our early arrival at the airport, and the drop in passenger numbers this year, queueing wasnt required. Tags scanned and luggage on its way, we joined the queue through security. Only two lanes were open, but the staff were extremely quick in moving passengers through. Before we knew it we were airside. From walking into the terminal to getting through security only took 20 mins. Obviously the main difference this year is the number of travellers going through Heathrow (or any airport for that matter). Airside was much quieter than we have seen, and one can only imagine the loss in revenue for the high end shops that cater to the wealthy passengers. We made do with visiting World Duty Free, then WHSmiths (always need some reading material) followed by a pint at the pub on the upper level. Naturally everyone is wearing masks and observing social distancing. My wife was disappointed that the perfume samples were not available - for me this was a major plus as I would usually have to wait ages for her to try different scents before choosing which to buy. Our flight usually departed from a B gate, but given the low number of flights, we were directed to one of the gates at the main lounge. Arriving back to Terminal 2 a week later was a little bit busier than before. To start off with as we deplaned, we had to show our COVID documentation (completed online 2 days before). Several fellow passengers had not done this so had to stand to one side and do it there and then. Our arrival coincided with a couple of long hauls from the Far East so there was a long queue at passport control. This wasnt helped by only three e-gates being used. Just as I got to the front of the queue, they closed the e-gate! However, a member of staff was very good at getting three lanes down through the 2 remaining e-gates. I wonder how these queues will change once we end the transition period at the end of the year. By the time we got through passport control and walked over to the carousel, the luggage was just being brought out. From exiting the aircraft to leaving the terminal took 50 mins.","{'neg': 0.031, 'neu': 0.903, 'pos': 0.066, 'compound': 0.9525}",0.9525

Additionally, their planes are hot since it seems they have not found a way to keep them cool without blowing air around to much. They are not investing in protecting you as a customer... DO NOT PROTECT THEM from the financial crisis. My seat's tablet also did not work so it's clear they aren't doing upkeep on their planes... doubt they are cleaning well.

Unless you happen to be in terminal A in some of the first gates, get ready to walk and walk and walk. In the design they did not include enough escalators and so both arriving and departing you queue to get on the escalator. Also, if you are in terminal B, you need to traverse under the tarmac. This is an incredibly long walk for an airport of this size - they state 7 minutes. Also, they oriented the entry to the airport at the end of terminal A instead of the middle. So for 3/4ths of the gates, get ready to walk. Also, terminal B, there are few amenities vs terminal A. Finally, for baggage claim, you need to commit to walk to one side or the other to see the posted bag claims for your flight. They should have signage before you have to commit to one side or another, otherwise you have to back track. Just feels like they could have accomplished all this with half the footprint. With all of the airport experience around the works, it is impossible to believe this airport could have been this poorly designed. I would recommend a serious rehab to fix these grave inconveniences. That said, it is new and clean. The skis come out on a dedicated ski carousel. The stores that do exist in terminal A are very nice.","{'neg': 0.028, 'neu': 0.866, 'pos': 0.106, 'compound': 0.9531}",0.9531

I booked a flight for a work trip and then a few months later left that company.  I called AA to cancel said flight and book two tickets for an upcoming flight which would result in leftover credit from the original trip. I was never sent a confirmation that the original flight was cancelled, or record of my trip credit. It took 3 calls over the course of 4 weeks to even confirm that our tickets had been booked, as each rep told me the previous rep did not press the right keys, but now they were booked, only to find invalid record locators for our flights. The night before our flight it appeared that our seats had disappeared. After a 4.5 hour call at 10pm, with the rep hysterically laughing that our flight no longer had seats and she could not use our credit, we finally figured out our tickets. Now, I am trying to book flights with the remaining balance and it has been next to impossible. I spent 2 hours on the phone with a rep this morning trying to find my flight credit with an email I received on June 1 (finally) listing my trip credit number. Even though my email was received on June 1 and noted that it was issued on June 1, I was repeatedly told that was invalid credit and was issued and used on May 20th. Not accurate. Finally I was reissued a travel credit and assured it would be an easy booking process when I called back. Here I am, on hold again for 30 minutes now because the rep cannot find the new credit number they issued or the travel credit at all. This process has not only been a gigantic waste of time (at least 12 hours on the phone at this point) but also infuriating that the errors and mistakes of AA’s booking process have become my own massive problem","{'neg': 0.073, 'neu': 0.799, 'pos': 0.128, 'compound': 0.9532}",0.9532

Our parents took time off work to keep him. American Airlines calls 11 days before departure and cancels flight, rebooks us for Jan 31. My parents take the week off work AGAIN to keep our son. AA calls 12 days before departure and cancels flight, rebooks us for Feb 13. Parents take the week off work AGAIN. Twice prior we had been offered a refund instead of a credit should we choose not to rebook. But this trip is important to us, so we remained dedicated to American Airlines and rebooked.Yesterday we found out that Cuba now requires a one week full quarantine. We cannot sustain this because of our kids. So we have no choice but to postpone our trip until regulations loosen. This was no fault of our own. Since we had been offered a refund over a credit with the previous short notice cancelations, we called to request one now that travel regulations had become impossible for us.We were told that the refund was no longer available, only a credit. When we were able to go, we had out flight canceled on short notice again and again. And now we are unable to go when we would have been able to go the previous booked dates. It is only because of out of the blue, short notice cancelations on the part of American Airlines that we are now unable to go, for we would never have been pushed back this far (to the date when new COVID regulations were put in place in Cuba) if we hadn’t had all of those flights canceled and then unable to rebook for a date close to our original departure dates.We asked for a supervisor and explained the situation (everything I wrote above). We were told we still can’t get a refund. We are not choosing to cancel because we just changed our minds. We would go if we could, but it’s not feasible right now because of the new restrictions placed yesterday. And we would not even be in the situation of having to deal with these new regulations if American Airlines hadn’t canceled on us twice, on short notice, back when the regulations were find for us to go. It was because of YOU delaying us that we are here. It is not our fault. It is YOURS. Therefore, YOU SHOULD be the one to do the right thing and return the money for the trips you have not ruined. A credit will not suffice. That is not how we expect to be treated. That is not how we have been treated by other airlines in the past.

0.9539,2020-07-01,2020-07-01,10.0,Poor COVID compliance during flight!,"While I was waiting for our plane to depart flying from Dallas to San Diego I remember hearing the flight attendant through the speakers thanking us for flying American and how the airline is doing everything they can to protect us during these times... I felt a chill run through me as I watched a plane full of terrified passengers. Such a surreal image in front of me, I felt mocked and ridiculed by American Airlines. This is what I experienced:1. Seating- We were a group of 3 traveling together but our seats were apart. When I approached the flight attendant at the gate (in Dallas on our way home to San Diego) to ask if they could move us and have us sit together (because you know, there is a pandemic going on and we wish to stay within ""our bubble""), he didn't even look at the screen to check he simply said: this is an full flight. WHAT? The announcement left me flabbergasted. A completely full flight during a pandemic? Didn't American reassure me they were doing everything they could? What happened to the promised social distancing measures on the aircraft to ensure OUR safety?  What happened to leaving empty seats to try to maintain distance? How come small businesses have to comply with this measure costing them greatly but one of the biggest corporations in the world can't be held accountable? So WHY is the company not implementing social distance guidelines? Furthermore, this employee didn't even try moving passengers around so we could sit together; not just for our safety but for the safety of others. Did not bother, did not care.2. Boarding- all other major airlines I have flown with since this whole thing started have been boarding backwards starting from the end of the plane. This is to avoid people standing in the aisle while people are seated. But not American Airlines, no. As we sat, there were hundreds of passengers looming over us waiting for the line to move. INSANE.3. Other concerns- Another thing I didn't see was the temperature check. I saw at least 1 very sick passenger, pale with visible sweats and barely able to stand or walk straight. I am not saying it was due to COVID but I had to certify that I didn't have any symptoms when flying so why was this person traveling with an illness? I would have expected any sick person to STAY AT HOME and for the company to implement that so passengers feel SAFE. Another thing that concerned me was that a lot of passengers were wearing their masks under their nose and the crew members allowed them to.So when I received an email with a survey asking if I would recommend others to fly American Airlines the answer is simple: NO. Or at least NOT YET. Even though American Airlines have implemented many other excellent measures (requiring face masks during the duration of the flight as well as adding HEPA filters and electrostatic sprays inside the aircraft to kill germs and viruses), this is simply not enough to travel with the absolute confidence you promised us. Small locally owned businesses with less resources have stricter rules and more drastic measures than what I experienced during my flight. I will hold American Airlines (and any other major corporation) to the highest standards simply because WE SHOULD.","{'neg': 0.065, 'neu': 0.843, 'pos': 0.092, 'compound': 0.9539}",0.9539

The aircraft was very new, and looked in excellent condition.  One surprise was the lack of luggage storage bins over the middle seats of the Delta One cabin.  Had the flight been full, then there could have been an issue with lack of storage space.  However, the Delta One cabin was half full, at most.  I had been curious about the Delta One suites, noting previous positive reviews.  I had booked into seat 3B, and noted that entry into the suite was restricted - this was not an issue with seat 2B on the return journey.  To be frank, I found the suite to be somewhat claustrophobic, even by leaving the door open.  The seat, which converted into a fully flat bed, was pleasantly wide but was fairly uncomfortable.  [To put this into perspective, I make similar comments  about seats in all the Airbus models, including the A320, A330, A340 and A380 for multiple airlines].  Extra lighting in the suite would have been useful as I like to read during long haul flights - this was very difficult once the main cabin lights were switched off.  The Delta service was excellent with tasty meals and snacks, and attentive, friendly cabin staff.

We were in different rows seated next to complete strangers.  The mask was required to board the plane but after that people removed them and not one person was asked to put their mask back on.  The flight attendants did offer the option to change seats with the exception of the back and front rows to protect the crew and allow them social distance!  How thoughtful of them!

We went to the desk to see if there were seats available since the flight was due to take off in 1 hour. Luckily there were some seats available. Great! We were told we would have to pay the difference in air fare. Our original tickets were $500...the difference in airfare was $1550!!! I was told it was because the flight was close to fully booked. I understand there weren't a lot of seats left, but if there are seats left on a place that is due to take off in 1 HOUR, they are only going to be filled by standby passengers where there is no additional charge. To charge $2000 for tickets (for a direct 2 hour flight from Dallas to Phoenix mind you) is absurd and unreal. On top of this, they lost my golf bag (again, direct flight) and my wife's luggage was rifled through on the way back and she had a romper that was missing. Did I mention that I was the top tier of their Loyalty Program (meaning I fly 40-50 trips/year for work), and we also have the AA credit card that we use for all our expenses and bills, totaling around $30-60k / year?!?! If this is how a company takes care of their ""loyal"" customers, I would be afraid to see how they treat people who only fly with them 1x / year. Covid is not a reason to take advantage of people.

If you have a Southwest travel fund, READ THIS. I have a Southwest travel fund for $167 that expires Sept. 17, 2020. I had planned to use it this Spring, until national restrictions due to Covid-19 prevented my travel. In May, a Southwest travel rep reassured me the travel fund expiration date was extended to Dec. 17, 2020. I was SO relieved because $167 is a good amount of money I didn't want to lose, and I couldn't travel again any earlier than October 2020. But when I tried to book my flight (in June), I got an error message that said my travel fund expiration date was Sept. 17, 2020. I immediately called Southwest customer service to explain that I was told the wrong expiration date by one of their reps and due to Covid-19 health concerns and regional restrictions, I can't use my travel credit until October 2020. FUN FACT: Did you know... Southwest is extending the expiration date for travel funds that expire between March 1 and Sept. 7, 2020, to now expire Sept. 7, 2022? That now gives travelers 2 YEARS to use their travel credit. I have to assume they've done this to protect the health of those Southwest fliers who don't feel safe flying any time soon and in the midst of Covid-19. What a nice, and very practical, gesture! Let me remind you my travel fund expiration date is Sept. 17, 2020. And because it falls 10 days later, my own health and safety is NOT prioritized by Southwest travel policy-makers. Instead, I'm forced to use my $167 travel fund by Sept 17, 2020 and risk not only my own health, but that of my friends, family and fellow fliers -- or it disappears forever. I spoke with several reps (including a customer relations manager) and none of them gave a damn that I couldn't use my travel fund, when I was initially told by one of their reps that it expired on Dec. 17, 2020. That doesn't sound like Transfarency to me! What do you think? It's no wonder Delta is my #1...they actually make exceptions in the interest of the health and safety of their frequent fliers.

So I chug my luggage and my family to the rebook area where only one employee was at that station attending everyone who had an issue with their flight.  I finally get to speak with the representative who told me the best thing she could do is reschedule us on another flight the next day for an additional $300.  That isn't the worst of the story so we make it to the flight the next day and when we are boarding are told that there was no more room for our carry on luggage so they would be sending it to the luggage area.

You would think they would allow me in their lounge after getting their most expensive ticket. No, they wanted me to have some kind of upscale American Express card as well.  I had a burger in the airport cultural garden instead.  This trip didn't start out too well.  Actually the garden was pretty nice and the burger quite tasty. At the gate, there was an incredibly boring gate agent talking all kinds of nonsense. Like he was saying something about a recent trip he took and how different the scanner is they have here from where he went. Nobody cares. I just wanted to get on board for some reason. He tried to come off real folksy and friendly like. I'm not sure why he's so annoying. Maybe it's because when I got on the plane , I saw all these people passing me by and how close I was to them...  I put on a  second mask. This pandemic got me so anxious all the time.  I mean you can follow my thinking, right?  Anywayon the plane, i began to wonder what all the other people were thinking when I started spraying down my pillow and blanket with the mini Lysol Grace gave me. Looked like most people on board didn't care. I'll tell you what - flight attendants were real friendly and nice. I'm a bit surprised because I thought they were all up-tight and grumpy because of the recent hassles they get from passengers because of the mask mandates. Rolling out to that runway I always see when I'm at Hickam Beach was kind of cool so I videoed it.  And so the flight starts. Not too impressed with this first class seat I had. I didn't see any kind of hand control for the entertainment screen. It's all touchscreen.  Don't worry, I cleaned it with Chlorox wipes first. It's kind of far from the seat so it was hard to see especially for a blind old man like me. The seat itself was comfortable enough I guess since it lays out flat. I had a couple Bloody Marys made with Finlandia Vodka.  They didn't have any lemon to put in it so that was disappointing. It was a box meal for lunch. Actually a tasty spring chicken salad with strawberries and spinach and walnuts. Certainly not a first-class meal but you know the pandemic gives them a reason to go quick and cheap. Saw only  one movie: Francis McDormand in Nomadland. It's really a movie about absolutely nothing, but she's such a strong actress that she pulls it off.  After that I tried to get some sleep but no such luck. We landed and I'm in my hotel now. Did stop first and over ate some fast food.  Will try to get into Canada tomorrow.

I did not want to leave her in DC this weekend because boarding her would be too expensive for it to be worth it (total about $150 for her to stay in a private room for three nights and get fed on a schedule and private time with a cat-sitter). When I tried to call this morning to ask about my ESA there was a 16 minute wait- from experience I knew this would end up being much longer- so I just got to the airport early- 6 am for a 10:30 flight. I was told I would have to pay $125 each way for my cat (my ticket was around $300 round trip). I tried to register her as a service animal because if she was a dog, she would fit every definition of a service animal under the Americans with disability act. But since she is a cat I sat waiting for three hours waiting to hear back only to get the answer that the only way she could come with me is if I paid $125. I did it because at that point I was going to be late for my flight if I tried to fight this ableist policy further. And then I found out when I got to the gate that my flight is delayed two hours. I ONLY bought this ticket because it was in the morning and was cheap. I have plans in Boston this early afternoon, but now will miss them, paid way more than if I just got a direct flight to Logan with another airline. The people at the desk tried to help me, but because American Airlines and the US gov’t does not keep disabled people in mind when making policy about disabled people, I am now sitting in the terminal writing this review instead of en route to seeing my older sister the day before her belated 2020 graduation. And the less time I can spend with her before having to go to a celebration for my best friends father on Sunday. I WILL cancel my ticket back on Monday if I am not reimbursed in some way for the financial, emotional, and physical toll that this whole ordeal has caused me. American Airlines you need to do better.

Being that this was a Maui (Hawaii) flight, there were a few extra hurdles too jump through.  To visit Hawaii, one must go through the Hawaii Safe travels portal and enter Covid info and, then, with a QR code in hand, the next stop is to go through the connecting flight to Hawaii's properly assigned gate to answer a few more questions, show the QR code, and get a wrist band.Even if there was enough time to go to a lounge, this extra bump in the road gobbled up any and all extra time.  No one said this would be easy so we were not surprised.  Bye, bye, free time.Once on board for the 5 hour and 43 minute flight to Maui, our last-row in first class seating was like being at the back of the bus.

Maybe you airline folks could order, oh I don't know, maybe a few ""extra"" meals so there would be some suggestion of a ""choice"" at the end of the line?  Yeah, that sucked.  Oh, but that would cost money and the bean counters don't like to see any of that cold hard cash go to waste.Our ""lunch"" was a packaged sandwich, a salad, a sweet-something-or-other, and something else less than memorable.  One of us got the mozzarella and tomato baguette and the other the turkey sandwich.  It was decent.  Not great, but edible.  As the attendant told us, the other people across the aisle from us did not get what they wanted either.  Oh, now I feel so much better!!!  Misery loves company.Who do we have to thank for this?  Probably the corporate bean-counters who think up new ways to tighten that bottom line.  Whew.  So good to know someone is out there taking care of us travelers!

My husband and I were on the 4:40pm flight from PHX to SAT on 1/25/2022.  What follows here is public information that a passenger bellowed from her seat for everyone around her to hear.  A red headed woman was sitting in row 8 with her husband talking loudly and not wearing a mask.  She kept repeating herself and dropped a few F* bombs, I’m pretty sure there was some alcohol involved.  She said she’s from Cave Creek AZ and she had quit her job at the Marriott because they wanted all employees to get vaccinated.  She also said she hadn’t worn a mask in months, and her opinion was that it’s her choice.  She also bragged that her son had tested positive for Covid, but exhibited no symptoms.  All of this was going on while the flight attendants stopped by several times and asked her to put on her mask and to lower her volume.  Finally the gate attendant came by and asked her to please follow them.  She stood up and stomped off the airplane towards the jet bridge saying, “well I wonder what I did?!?”.  Then yelling and screaming commenced on the jet bridge, with lots of F* bombs.  Then she stomped back on the plane cursing and yelling at her husband that they were kicking her off the plane.  He stood up and asked why, when they explained that she didn’t comply with their several requests to put on a mask,   He said, “she only had it lowered for a minute! Do you have video of her not wearing a mask?”.  Those passengers didn’t return.  I want to commend American Airlines and their employees for making the difficult choice of asking a very disruptive and obnoxious passenger to step off the plane.  I know it wasn’t an easy choice, or an easy situation, but it was the right choice! As for red haired Cave Creek woman, thank you for showing me how NOT to act in public.  You are welcome to spread your germs and your obnoxious opinions, just not on Federal Property or on commercial flights where everyone is required to wear a mask, and respect the people around them. Per FAA regulations and sitting in such close quarters, her actions were very disrespectful to the passengers around her.  Yes you are entitled to your opinion, but not everyone on the plane needs to be subjected to it.","{'neg': 0.068, 'neu': 0.825, 'pos': 0.107, 'compound': 0.9625}",0.9625

We purchased economy plus tickets for the first, and first class for the latter.The economy plus seats were marginally, and I mean marginally, more comfortable than the economy seats.  We got a reasonable price on those seats, but for a couple extra hundred dollars it was barely, barely worth it.  Very underwhelming seats, and you still get the same ""snacks and beverages"" that normal economy does - one bag of snacks (like 3 bites) and one small cup of soda (like 2 or 3 sips).The first class seats were the biggest disappointment.  Our flight took off at 9pm from Kona so we were really hoping to get some sleep in the first class section.  The seats are quality leather, but our seats padding felt extremely worn and we could feel the support bars underneath.  They also don't recline enough to actually get comfortable enough to sleep.  We couldn't get a wink of sleep in those seats and ending up staying awake for the entire night, until the next day.  We did get a box meal which was small but good, I would value it around $10 or $15.  But for the BIG BIG price ticket of these seats they were a huge disappointment.Overall, ok.

To start with a number of the staff particularly at checking and a few on the plane where particularly grumpy and unhelpful providing little information leaving plenty of room for interpretation; you can compare their demeanour too Ross (the angry slug lady) from monster.INC, I was able to watch this film as after three attempts of restarting the entertainment system only the children movies worked. Now we come to the food which was somewhat questionable; I never really expect high quality food in the air however AA should consider having words with their meal planner as this menu did take the biscuit compared to other airline meals, I have had the pleasure of tasting.  To start with they the provided an option for the chicken or pasta (very descriptive options) I went for the chicken of which was included sting like bits of chicken with what I assume was giant cuscus or bulgur wheat which resembled and provided the mouth feel of eating frog spawn. The miniscule tub of lettuce had the appearance of three-week-old lettuce which had somehow retained its crunch must have been radioactive, this roughly 15gram salad was accompanied by a 43 gram sachet of salad dressing; the AA food planner has an unusually ratio of dressing to salad you might as well drink it if using the whole sachet! The additional items included a alterative brand dairylea triangle which was politely labelled as gourmet cheese of which I found relatively amusing by this stage. The mini bread roll provided was inedible as it was cold and very dense (with comparable density to pellets we fed to alligators in Gatorland a few days prior) neither me or my travel companion managed a quarter of this dense bland doughy bread roll, if you can even call it a bread roll. The saving grace of the meal which is an run of the mill cinnamon Churro roll. Throughout the flight passing air hostesses happened to crash into our isle at every opportunity and did not drive the cart with the gracefulness you would expect from Dominic Tureto in fast and furious 9 or so I have been told as the viewing privileges for this movie were unavailable.

On November 19, 2020 my nephew and I flew from BWI-DEN to connect to DEN-EUG to visit my son on United Airlines. Upon arrival at Denver International Airport, I was shocked to see so many travelers not practicing social distancing. It looked like a regular day at the airport pre-COVID where no one was practicing social distancing. There were lines at the eatery, Smash Burger in particular, where there were no social distancing guidelines and the patrons did not take it upon themselves to do such. What was more distressing was that at the sitting area at the gates there was no signage as to be 6ft apart or the seats with the signage to be 6ft apart. Some travelers did not have their mask on or did not have their mask on properly - meaning over mouth and nose. It did not look like security was reminding people to social distance. There was even one man strolling through the airport with the mask in his hand swinging it back and forth. CDC and other health officials have warned about traveling safely during the holidays. I did not feel safe at Denver International Airport! While at this point I do not know if Colorado has mandated strong COVID prevention practices, I will say I was surprised that travelers were not taking precautions. Please note that until there is a way to slow down the infection rate of COVID-19, I will not be going to or transferring planes in Denver, CO. Stay informed. Wear a mask.

Like that flight, this was also operated by a 777 but a 200 as opposed to a 300.  This is significant because of the different cabins and seats.  The 300 is a 4 class plane with an actual first class cabin (2 rows in front) and the 200 is a 3 class plane; biz, premium econ and econ.  I was in the first row (yay) on the right side of the plane.  The seat itself was similar to the 300 variant but was also different enough to warrant this review.  Overall, I preferred this seat to the 300 version.  It felt a little roomier, the screen was fixed in place and the overall impression is that it's a newer product.The ground experience was pretty good.  Checking a bad was quick with the kiosk but then I had to leave the kiosk area and get on a short line to drop the bag with an agent.  It felt like the line should have been setup more naturally from the kiosk area.  Terminal 8 at JFK is one of the better terminals and getting through TSA was quick.  The flight started boarding on time but we left the gate about 20 mins late.  It was fun to board the plane and go left instead of right.

After that we asked about our bags he said once we get back to Columbus at almost 11pm we have to go request our bags for a call back from DC and that it will take over a day to get our bags because according to him ""they are behind with cancellations and they won't go looking for just our two suitcases I guarantee it"". Once again the customer service and the way he talks to us is award winning, Southwest must be proud of the way they interview, hire, and train. We only received a 50% refund from Airbnb so we lost $650 and our wedding anniversary trip was ruined because of Southwest Airlines.","{'neg': 0.043, 'neu': 0.861, 'pos': 0.096, 'compound': 0.9649}",0.9649

Then. it took well over 10 days to receive a response, in which I then played a game of cat and mouse via additional requests through their website.  The entire experience took over 3 months to get resolved. The few times I've encountered staff at the Denver airport and a few other destinations have been anything but friendly.

The restaurants had very long lines, so I stopped in a convenience shop and got a sandwich to avoid the lines. Dogs: They have airport comfort dogs, I was really hoping to see one.

Once in the plane the Flight attendants were so interactive with us I had the puppy on my lap the whole time throughout the flight and even the people in the cabin were good with it, I can say speaking from my own experience Delta is an extreme class act and I highly recommend them. The only negative thing I would say is that the plane was one of their smaller planes and it wasn’t very roomy in the seat and having the kennel under the seat in front of me there was barely any leg room to move around.Also another tip for anyone that is flying with any airline, do yourself a favor and buy a soft sided kennel and freeze a very, very small bowl of water and let it defrost in the kennel with the puppy so they can drink from it and also wee-wee pads!!

In order to do this, Delta will re-price the departure flight to today’s price (even though you’re not changing that segment) and charge you accordingly. Let’s say that new one-way departure flight is $220. Delta will tell you that you OWE them money to change to a one-way ticket.Had you booked 2 one-way tickets, you could cancel the return and hold on to a voucher for $100.Even if you wanted to just change a portion of your flight, you will be much better off having two separate tickets. That way you won’t be penalized with two increases of fare just to change one segment. Delta claims to be like other airlines with a no change fee, but they clearly still have predatory pricing policies in place to beef up their profits.Huge difference.

Previously, AA says we can just use this for new flights when we need it but it’s actually just a nightmare!In order to use this credits and voucher, we had to call AA customer service 5 times, each time the agents were giving us different information. Many of them say we can’t use our paper voucher with credits for our new tickers for different reasons, but when we call the supervisor or other agents, many of them confirmed we could. Then after many calls, they finally resolved and agreed it’s possible and ask us to go to the airport to redeem the voucher as the last step. But when we arrive at the airport, the agent told us they can’t use the credit at the airport, and ask us to call online agent again. In the end, one airport agent really helped us, and honestly the only one that knows the process and got the ticket for us. If we haven’t met him, we will probably need to spend another 5 hours calling AA customer service line.It’s a horrible back and forth experience, almost no agent seems to be trained enough to know the correct answer. The wait every time is super long. Every agent is saying different things. I’ve never experienced this with any other airline. AVIOD at all cost.

The fight leg of the trip we got rerouted to Washington and should have gone to Charlotte. This flight should have left at 7:30 am but we didn't take off till 2:30. Customer in the airport was lacking. We asked for help to find a different flight and or status of the current flight and we told its not my fault the plane we are waiting for had mechanical issues. Not so much as a apologize or a sense of compassion about the situation. The plane finally came and the previous passenger got off the plane and we boarded with in 10 minutes. This tells me the plane was not cleaned even though there are signs in the gate area posted by American airline on how their passenger safe is important and they keep with the highest standards of sterilizing. That's a joke. There idea of sterilizing is handing the boarding passages and alcohol wipe as they got on the plane but yet I'm still required to wear a mask that I can take off to eat or drink and expose myself and other to sickness from touching something on their dirty plane. This isn't the end of my adventures. Leaving New Orleans our plane boarded 45 mins late and there was no communication from American airline at all and the same cleaning issue occurred. Thanks for the alcohol wipe American airlines. We were also layer over on the way home . Our flight out of Charlotte also left late and still no cleaning procedures in ace but the small 2x2 alcohol wipe provides. I called the customer service number and schedule a call back since hold times were over 4 hours ( I kid you not) One I finally got someone on the phone I was told I have to reach out to customer relations to file a complaint. Um well who was I calling them? I was directed to the aa.com website. Here guess what you only get to send an email and are limited to the number of characters you can enter regarding your complaint. So let me get this straight American airlines you are available to talk to customers when you are scheduling flights ( or taking money) but when you have gotten paid for a service regardless of the quality of this service the you claim to care so much about or at least that is what you on hold recording says you are no longer available to help. I work in customer service and this is unexpected treatment of your customers.

At Laguardia our flight was delayed by almost two hours and we subsequently missed our connecting flight to Los Angeles.the agents were also not that helpful or on top of it. Also, they honestly could have asked the connecting flight to wait a bit as there were quite a few passengers travelling to LA from this flight and in the end we arrived 5 minutes after the connecting flight left.  The reason AA gave for the delay was weather issues, but there was nothing wrong with the weather as it was clear and perfect including further east. Apparently they use this excuse in order to not have to reimburse their passengers. A new trick they have come up with taking advantage of people. We not only lost money on a hotel in LA but also had to pay for a hotel in Nashville. They also do not answer their 24 hour contact phone number. We are rebooked to fly out tomorrow but have heard from other passengers that delays and cancellations have been going on for some time now. AA has lost staff and instead of being honest about the fact that they are understaffed like Spririt airlines they lie about the weather so you are stuck sorting out your loss because of them.

The people taking your luggage were quick and efficient.   Trying to ask someone at the gate area   a question was ridiculous!   He kept saying oh I don’t understand.  He also talked down to people on the speaker.  All gates are announcing and nobody is stating where the flight is going.  People were confused.  Understandable as people are trying to spread out and sit with their groups.  With that being said , I do not underrating the open seating with covid.  Why not sit a group of people together If they can take up an entire row?  If you are practicing to reduce the spread, enforce  more safety measures.   No wipes to wipe your tray tables or antibacterial soap anywhere to be found. And in the amount of time we loaded, there is no way they wiped the plane down.  They had maybe 10-15 minutes in between one group unloading and another loading.    Then sit by a stranger when we have 6 in our group and could all sit together.   (And we could sit anywhere on the plane.  Not looking for front row). Then one poor lady entered in last group.  She had a kid about 4 or 5 years old.  They were going to make that kid sit by himself with strangers.  One of the air line stewardess made an announcement to help them.  They entered the plane with a group of 3.  Why would you allow such careless sitting on your plane?  It is amazing to say that people can’t dine inside after riding on this plane.  With the amount of warnings and emails we received on covid, you would think more safe guard measures would be put in place.  I am just trying to figure out how you made things safer?

Prior to my flight, I took my luggage to be tagged as well as asking for a paper ticket.  The ticket did not show my TSA # and I thought that was curious because when I flew down to Baltimore, it did in fact show the TSA#.  I have purposely renewed my membership through the system due to not having to take my shoes off, coat, jacket, the entire ordeal going through regular security.

He said he could do nothing about their error and I would have to go through regular security.  I asked to speak to a supervisor, which I did, he said this happens to about 10% of people and was very flippant, stating he could do nothing to rectify the matter.

One issue was with seating as I was going to be traveling with my elderly mother- I was concerned about us not being able to sit together on an international flight due to some ticket restrictions, but Dave helped make sure we could be together and relieved much of my anxiety and stress I had felt about the flight and traveling with my mother.

When we walked up together hand in hand asking for the seat tickets the lady gave it to us and we got aboard the plane. When I checked our seats, my daughter’s seat and mine were not together (actually my seat was half way across the other side of the plane). As you can understand I don’t want my daughter sitting next to a stranger through a 8-12 hour flight especially since she’s young (7 years old). So we ask a member of staff about the issue and they said to ask the person who has that seat to swap with you. Understandable. So when the man arrives I ask him if he can swap his seat with mine so we can sit together, he therefore agrees and everything is fine. Or so I thought. About 10-20 minutes later the man starts to complain and wants his seat back and sit next to my daughter despite the fact we agreed on swapping. A member of staff approaches and asks what’s wrong and the man says even though we agreed to swap seats he’s upset about it. The lady who gave us the seat tickets came on board and asked me to go to my original seat so he can have his original seat back. I told her I wasn’t comfortable with that since I don’t want my daughter sitting next to a stranger for 12 hours and that we already agreed. So then I asked her why she gave us different seats in the first place and she said and I quote “You both came up to me separately so I thought you were separate passengers” MY DAUGHTER IS 7 AND WE WERE TOGETHER HOLDING HANDS WHILST WE GOT OUR SEAT TICKETS!! SHE LIED! So I called her out on her lie explaining how we were there together and she wasn’t happy with that so she threatened me and my daughter that we will get kicked off the plane if we don’t co operate! The man decides that it’s okay and he’ll sit in my original seat like we agreed on however throughout the rest of the flight, the staff were giving me the silent treatment and were giving me glares, side eyes and judgemental looks despite the fact I acted in a calm manner throughout the situation unlike the seat ticket lady who got sassy and disrespectful.

Checked in/went through security while my daughter was not wearing a mask with no issues whatsoever. And have traveled previous to this trip while my daughter was 2 and she was resistant to wearing her mask and never had any issues. However on this trip once I was got to the ticket agent at the gate I was told my 2 year old needs to wear her mask or else we can't get on the plane. I asked the ticketing agent if there was any leniency as my daughter is barely 2 and continually pulls her mask off. The only response I received was a prompt ""MOVE TO THE SIDE MA'AM!!"" and then while I'm struggling to get my 2 year old to wear her mask and juggling all our bags and trying to hold her I overhear the ticketing agent berating me to other passengers boarding the plane. Super hurtful and totally unnecessary. I was thankfully able to get my daughter to finally keep her mask on and asked if we could please board the plane. I received the go-ahead, but little did I know this ticketing agent had went ahead onto the plane to tell the flight attendants and captain of the plane that we were a ""mask issue"" So of course I was promptly stopped from boarding the plane and no one is telling me anything. I finally saw the ticketing agent and asked why we couldn't board the plane now that my daughter is not pulling her mask off. She said ""well we can't guarantee she wont' pull it off on the flight"" Ummm she's a baby! of course we can't guarantee she won't pull it off and further more what's the difference between someone pulling there mask down to eat/drink?? Somehow that's okay but a 2 year old tugging at her mask is unfathomable?? So at this point I was told ""the captain does not want any ""mask issues"" today and he said No to us boarding the plane and that's what I get, but that the supervisor was coming down to talk to me but it's not up to him"".  Well thankfully the supervisor did come down because I found out that the ticketing agent told the captain, flight attendants, and supervisor that I was the one not willing to wear my mask (mind you I had been wearing my mask the ENTIRE time) and as I'm starting to cry because I think that I'm not going to get to see my family the supervisor says to me ""you know you need to wear your mask the enter flight correct?"" OF COURSE! I was never the issue. My two year old didn't want to wear her mask and it's kind of hard to rationalize with a two year old who is barely talking why she must keep a mask on her face. Once he realized that this ticketing agent was clearly targeting me and my two year old daughter he was able to convince the captain we were not an issue, we were granted access to get on the plane. I'm so grateful to that kind supervisor and that I was able to actually speak with him and clear up the lies that were told about me.  I have never been treated so poorly and still can't believe that this ticketing agent was purposely targeting me and my two year old. I understand there are rules and regulations and we were happy to comply but the fact that my 2 year old pulling on her mask was the cause of us to almost not even be able to get on our flight was absolutely ridiculous! Where is your compassion??? Even on our trip back to Charlotte after seeing my family, we had just one flight attendant who constantly was checking up on my 2 year old to make sure she had her mask on, which she was wearing for most of the flight but of course my daughter at one point pulled her mask down and started to scream/cry (AGAIN SHE'S TWO!!) as I'm trying to put her mask back on, but no sympathy or help from the flight attendant, as she stood over us ensuring that my 2 year old wear her mask. I can't hold my hand over my toddlers mouth to ensure the mask stays put that's called child abuse! I was just berated some more about how ""If I'm traveling to another location I will have issues so be warned"" Ummm no I'm not traveling anywhere else and No, American Airlines and their awful employees were the ONLY ones I have had any issues with.  I will most definitely never fly American Airlines again, I will choose one of the many other airlines we have flown with while my daughter was 2 and were treated with kindness and help instead of constant targeting, berating, and any lack of compassion for a BABY!","{'neg': 0.069, 'neu': 0.841, 'pos': 0.09, 'compound': 0.9731}",0.9731

So rather than wait for the phone call, I drove to the airport to change it in person and take a flight, to find that the American agents were gone for the night.

So I sat at the airport waiting for them to call, which they did after 3.5 hours.

We ran to the gate (which was about 4 up from where we were) and they closed the doors and we ""missed"" the flight. We then needed to find another flight but I was hot. No one was accountable just repeatedly stating that we need to watch the monitors as it was our responsibility. Yes. I 100% agree if I hadn't been in almost constant communication with the lady who stated she would be the one to help. Everyone I talked to was rude and lacked any kind of empathy or accountability. If one more person stated that ""We change gates all the time, you need to watch the monitors"" I thought my head would explode. Whatever happened to common courtesy, or better yet, common sense?

The first leg of the flight was not too bad about 25 minutes from Fayetteville to Charlotte. The second leg was not as nice.  I did fly first class and the seats were not comfortable at all.  The seats were large with a lot of leg room; however the lumbar support was very uncomfortable.  The other thing that was a little annoying was no TV screens in the seats.  We even had a newer plane returning from San Antonio and it didn’t have TV screens, so make sure you bring a device to watch the free movies/TV they offer.  Staff was very helpful.  There was a young lady and her baby sitting near me and the flight attendant gave her some special attention, as well as taking care of the rest of the passengers in first class.

So easy to watch a couple movies and Wa-La, you're in Vegas! Check-in, Gate and Flight Crew were all awesome, friendly and welcoming. The flights were smooth. With the rowdy winter storms and Omicron hampering travel, we got a notice the night before our return home that our flight was rescheduled.

They had a special problem check in point and the agent was very helpful. Our flight home was broken into MSP then DTW. I had aisle in Main but the tv didn't work and I asked several attendants, all said they would check on it and it finally fired up an hour into the flight and then went out within 20 minutes.  We had a four-hour layover in MSP as the pilots were stuck in Boise due to the weather. We finally boarded at 11:15 PM, and arrived in Detroit at 2:30 AM. I was worried about getting carjacked on the way home or my husband falling asleep while driving because we don't stay up all night like that. All was well and in the end, considering how much weather and covid has impacted holiday travel, we felt lucky we arrived home only 5.5 hours late, even though it was 3:30 AM.

Customer service is about like I remember it, whether while dining in or at the boarding gate: courteous and polite, but kind of detached and aloof. I've never met any personnel in this airport who were either outright rude or outright bubbly, I guess that's just the Seattle way. Alaska and Delta have nice lounges there, and, again, the N concourse is nicely redone, so there is some incentive to transit through there more often in the future, but the airport still has a lot to be desired yet in terms of overall customer experience.

American Airlines tried everything to keep our money and not supply service. I talked to another super nice lady who told me that American Airlines was bought out by US Airways but they kept the American Airlines name as it was more popular on a Google search. This lady told me if ai reached out to customer relations that they would extend the credit until at least the end of the year. I just heard from American Airlines today and they said that they will NOT extend the date for the credit. I told them I can’t use the credit, no need to until the fall again like when flying last year. I said, give me a credit where I couldn’t fly and they said no. So they have decided to just take my money. I have flown Air Canada(many times), West Jet, Delta and I have never received such poor service and rudeness like I have with American Airlines. Knowing that US Airways bought  them out makes sense as I never had good luck with them either.

Instead of trying to help, the attendant pushed us off to the side and said a supervisor would be here but “since you didn’t check in there are no seats for you” when i tried telling him we clearly checked in and we have the proof of our boarding pass and our seat assignments he really just wanted me to sit to the side and be quiet. The supervisor finally showed up 30 minutes later and after being called 4 times and told us it was a glitch in their system and that they gave away the seats we paid for and she confirmed we were in fact checked in. We had to catch the next flight, thank goodness we didn’t HAVE to be home at a certain time. I understand technology glitches but she said if we wanted to put in a request for a refund we can online. Then customer service said since we still got a flight that day we can’t get a refund and the supervisor would have to hand out any voucher if that’s what they chose to do in our situation. So in all honesty if AA would have been the slightest apologetic and tried to somehow make the situation even just a tiny bit better for us since it was the airlines fault, that would have been extremely nice.

Recently my family and I were flying to Bozeman MT to visit Yellowstone National Park. When I tried to book my tickets online there was some sort of issue with the website so I had to call delta, when I spoke to a delta representative they were able to book the flight but they put my wife and I on one reservation and my kids on a separate reservation. I was assured that this was essentially just a technicality and something that needed to happen to accommodate whatever issue was happening on Delta's side, but that it would not negatively impact my travel. The first issue came up when we tried to check in. We couldn't check my kids in online as they were 'unaccompanied minors'. They're not flying unaccompanied, but to Delta it looked that way, so I called Delta again, they said there was nothing I could do, but we would just have to check in at any of the counters at the airport. After arriving 2 hours early as instructed we found a delta employee, explained that we needed to check bags and check in unaccompanied minors. They directed us to a service counter where we waited about 30 minutes in line. Once it was our turn the person at this counter informed us that there's a special counter for unaccompanied minors and that we'd have to wait in another line. An hour and fifteen minutes later we finally had our boarding passes and made our way to security. We arrived 2 hours prior to departure and made it to our gate 15 minutes after our flight's scheduled departure time, the only reason we made the flight is that it was running an hour late. We had also paid extra to choose our own seats, since we were traveling with our kids we wanted to make sure we're all sitting together. On our return flight however they seemed to misplace our seat assignments and put us elsewhere not together, not the seats we had chosen and paid for. I've had good experiences with delta in the past, but this was not one. It also wasn't limited to one person or one airport or one counter, every step of the way we got bad information or had to wait longer than was acceptable or didn't get services we paid for.

I suppose given that we booked basic economy and they were domestic flights, if we wanted to check baggage, we were going to have to pay per piece. So along with our 4 bodies we had: 2 carry on suitcases, my husbands backpack, our children’s diaper bag, a duffel bag for the kids clothes, a double stroller and 2 car seats 👀 talk about wishing I had 14 arms! Layovers are never long enough with all this baggage and 2 kids! We arrived to our first flight just in time and of course stressed about how we were going to get down the aisle.. the flight attendants were lovely and there was space in the overhead compartments in business, so they took some of our baggage and stored it there for us. The flight was enjoyable and I am happy to say that the flight attendants for our connecting flight were just as amazing! Now fast forward a week and to our return flights 🤦🏼‍♀️ We must have jinxed ourselves because on these flights, we were “those people” with “those kids”... after what felt like 2 very long and very exhausting flights, we were now faced with a toddler who had peed in his car seat while he was asleep and an infant who I had to wake up to get out of the plane... our poor cabin crew of course has to wait until we are off of the plane to leave themselves, so that adds stress to us. Not because of them, but just because we feel bad. So while my husband changed our toddlers clothes, I was wearing our infant and decided I’ll start taking baggage out of the plane. I grab the 2 suitcases and place them right outside of the plane... big mistake.. once you exit, you can re-board.. they saw the concern on my face for my husband and asked, so you have 1 bag left I take it? I said.... let me check.. 2 suitcases here and my baby, so that leaves, my husband, my toddler, a duffel bag, 2 backpacks and a car seat. The pilot heard and along with flight attendants, all assisted in grabbing our belongings and bringing them out for us 💙 they were so lovely and so helpful, without as much as a question or a complaint. It was heartwarming and allowed this stressed momma to relax a little! Once off the plane, we were faced with a small meltdown because our toddler wanted to go back on the plane.. after trying to calm him down, the pilot comes running up to us and presents him with his very own set of wings!!

0.9779,2021-07-01,2021-07-01,10.0,Fly with any carrier but American Airlines,"My husband was a hospice patient when we flew on American Airlines in late July and early August, 2021.  Because I needed as stress-free and comfortable of an experience as possible for my husband, I made our first-class reservations over the phone, informing them that my husband required wheelchair assistance, and that we would be traveling with our 9lb Yorkshire Terrier. Because we were traveling with the aforementioned Yorkie, we were not able to do online check-in. For the same reason, curb side check-in was also not available. While this makes absolutely no sense to me, we dutifully stood in a very long line to accomplish this task. Then we were told that a wheelchair was not available, and that we could sit and wait for one, with no guarantee that one would arrive in time for us to make our flight. Opting to walk, my 57 year old (once strong and 200 pound) husband had to rely on me, his 120 pound wife for assistance, nearly falling three times.  At our layover in Charlotte, a wheelchair WAS available, but the elderly woman who was supposed to assist us told us she was too busy to push the chair and that I would have to do it  myself (while lugging my carryon and the Yorkie).Our return flight was canceled and I had to wait hours to reschedule it for the following day, forcing us to miss a medical procedure that had been scheduled for my husband.When we landed once again in Charlotte on our return trip to Austin, an announcement was made that all wheelchair assist passengers were REQUIRED to remain in their seats until all other passengers had deplaned. This, and the fact that our wheelchair assistant spent nearly ten minutes chatting with the other assistants, gave us no time to use restrooms before boarding the plane. Being an AAdvantage member, and having spent close to $2,500 for our first class tickets, I decided to reach out to customer service to share our horrible experience. It took them close to 60 days to respond to me, and the response was basically a ""cut and paste"" lecture in economics (I never complained about the price of the tickets, I only said that for what we paid for first class tickets, we did not receive first class treatment.), airport policy regarding wheelchair assistance, and the ""operational challenges"" that American Airlines faces in trying to adhere to regulations pertaining to flight crews. American Airlines assured me that while they did absolutely nothing wrong, they wanted me to maintain a favorable impression of them! To accomplish this, they issued two trip credits in the amount of $150 each - one for me and one for my husband, who is now deceased.Because I do need to return to Cleveland for my beloved husband's funeral, I am entertaining the thought of using the trip credit and taking my chances with American Airlines once again. When I called to see if I could use the trip credit issued to my husband toward my own ticket, the ""customer service"" representative quite rudely informed me that it was just a trip credit, and anyone could use it. I cannot even put into words my disgust with American Airlines, and their total lack of care for their customers.","{'neg': 0.057, 'neu': 0.839, 'pos': 0.104, 'compound': 0.9779}",0.9779

I booked a round trip flight to travel to New Hampshire, flying into Boston on the 18th departing at 3:15, for a meeting on the 19th at 9am. I have family there so I was spending the holidays since I was there already. Return flight was for the 28th.It’s December 18th (day of the flight), I go get some coffee at a local coffee shop in Dallas and leave my wallet at the outside table. Noticed it when I got back to my apartment. Made some calls, went back their to look, looked in the parking lot (mine and the coffee shops) no where to be found. Looked for three or four hours finally coming to the conclusion I won’t be able to board this plane with out my ID. So knowing this I call American Airlines 800 number and let them know I wouldn’t be able to make the flight at 3:15 and to put me on a later flight so I can have time to figure out how to get on the plane. With some google research I found you can get through TSA if you have your SSN card and a form to verify your identity(also later remembered DFW has CLEAR in terminal E so I would’ve been fine no matter what). The nice man on the phone helped me out and booked a flight later in the evening for 7pm which would arrive at 12am which works(maybe a little sleepy the next day but I’d make it besides it was my dumb mistake leaving my wallet behind). The catch was my round trip now had to be converted into a one way to make up for the difference in fare cost, oh and the seats I paid to upgrade for two of the flights would have to be refunded but they can’t issue a voucher because the site wasn’t working. But I would be getting a $100 or so e voucher back for what was left return flight I used to pay for this more expensive one way flight. He even said he placed me in an isle seat upon request because I am 6’4” and definitely need the room. (Usually this means your checked in when you’ve selected a seat)I get to DFW around 6pm (many would be worried about missing their flight but Becauae of COVID there’s barely anyone at security and getting through takes at tops 5 minutes right now). I get to the check in desk around 6:20 because I need to check a bag, and the (not so) very lovely lady told me I cannot check in and cannot check my bag because I am too late, which is sometimes the case showing up 40-45 minutes before departure(a gamble I don’t recommend taking if you like your shampoo and such) but I had no liquids I just had a backpack and a small suitcase and didn’t want to lug the suitcase everywhere so I wanted to check it. But I was too late, so I then see I myself am not checked in, so I go to check in at the desk. The lady now tells me I cannot check in, and am now on standby for tomorrow for a flight departing at 12:45pm.  Obviously frustrated, and upset after a long, stressful, and unfortunate day, I walked away and went back to my apartment. After I got back I called up American again and explained what happened and after thinking about it, not understanding why I wasn’t able to check in even though I had plenty of time to make the flight, and now not only being placed on a flight the next afternoon, but being placed on standby for a flight the next afternoon.I was greeted by a younger woman who understandably had some trouble reading through the reservation as it went from round trip to one way to being ‘missed’ to now on standby. She finally read through it all and told me the only thing I could do was pay an extra $200 something dollars to get a seat on the plane at 12:45pm the next day. Because that’s the difference in fares. I kindly explained what happened and wanted to understand why I wasn’t able to check in, and why I have no been placed on standby when I need to be in the plane and get to NH ASAP to now kiss some butt for being(a day) late. I also explained why I felt it was unreasonable for me to have to pay an extra $200 to make sure I get this seat when I have already had to exchange my round trip flight to a one way flight and for some unknown reason want allowed to be checked in.She told be that changing the ticket from the first flight at 3:15 to the second flight at 7:00 was a courtesy (even though in essence paid an extra $190) and was considered a ‘no show’ even though I called a few hours before boarding began. And then being bumped to standby the next day was a courtesy as well because I never checked in for the flight at 7:00 and was also considered a ‘no show’. After being told that i simply asked okay, so there is nothing you can do for me unless I pay another $200 and you don’t have a reason for why I wasn’t able to check in. And she responded with theres no other option. So that’s my story, hope you enjoyed.

I find it very hard to trust your company and the compensation for missing clothes and other belongings such as medication, toiletries, electronics, shoes and countless other things has cost me money that you are not willing to give me back unless I have receipts. To me that is the most corrupt and evil mindset and crime a company can commit again humanity or someone like me. I have not been able to change clothes, I wore the same items for weeks on end, dealt with pain and depression, and the items in my luggage are precious gifts that I thought I would never get back. Now I get them back but the time, effort and money I spent trying to move through life since will not be replace unless I have a receipt which is robbery to me and I’m sure everyone else’s eyes globally. I feel that the least you could do is offer complimentary hotel and food vouchers or something more because you know very well that your company has caused me extensive anguish and exhaustion chasing down my belongings. To be American Airline should be the best airline in the world and honestly you have failed the American people by calling yourself American Airline but delivering such and experience to me and I know countless others without adequate service recovery.

My first flight was full but my second one was nearly empty, allowing me to basically have no contact with anyone, which was nice.

However, I was disappointed in 1. the deplaning procedure, and 2. the flight attendants’ attitudes.Keeping the middle seats open is great. Boarding ten people at a time is good, provided that people line up IN THE  CORRECT  NUMERICAL ORDER. And I must be fair to say that we arrived 30 minutes early on our return trip.However, when it’s time to deplane it’s the usual free for all. It’s a rush to be the first one off the plane, with many passengers crowding together in the aisle (how hard would it be to change this procedure, just like boarding?).Also, once the bag of “snacks” and CUP of water is handed out,  the flight attendants seem to become very scarce for the remainder of the flight, and asking for a second water seemed to annoy one of them. So much for Southwest’s caring and friendly approach to customers.Will I fly with them again? Yes. Will I hope for better and friendlier service? Definitely.","{'neg': 0.049, 'neu': 0.769, 'pos': 0.182, 'compound': 0.9787}",0.9787

Once at the gate, I was advised that boarding will begin starting with rows from the back to the front. Upon entry of the aircraft, I was handed a hand wipe (Purex). I had my own of which I used to wipe down my seat, monitor, seat pocket, arm rest and tray table. The boarding process was quick, organized and easy. Only one flight, Ontario, Ca. to Atlantia did they not board from back to front. The rest of the flights boarded accordingly as I mentioned earlier. Shortly after the plane reached the desired altitude, snacks were served. First and business class passengers receivers snack boxes and all other classes received snack bags. There was no contact between the flight attendants and passengers. Everyone wore masks and ensured that my safety was their first priority. I love this airline!P.s.

Had it not been for the credit we’d have likely flown United or Delta as past experiences with American had always been poor. Ok, let me pause and explain that the trip to DFW was originally booked on American because the fare was too good to pass up. I also figured that it was due time to give A.A. another chance. I got the same lackluster experience as my past encounters.The trip started with a flight connecting in DFW to catch a 2nd plane heading west. The pilots didn’t do much of anything in the way of communication with passengers. I bring this up because we taxied continuously for a good 5-8 minutes from landing toward the gate. We then came to a stop for another 10 minutes or so and no announcement or guidance as to what was going on. We got moving again and made it to the gate. The next time I heard anything from the pilot was climbing off the plane, “thank you for flying with us!” was tossed my way routinely.Things would surely get better from there, right? Sorry, my mistake. We got ready to board the second flight and my carry on bag was targeted for “bulging a little too much” so on we went with a gate checked bag. Wonderful. I’d have shrugged this off if not for the two other bulging bags I passed in the overhead bins near the more premium seating or the additional person that got on behind me with the same size and style bag in maroon. Yes, it was bulging more than mine. Ok, ok. You’re probably thinking “wow this dude is a whiner!” and as I stand on my soap box, I’d probably agree but stay with me here. We sat down in our seats to wipe things down with the sanitation wipes I got from UNITED the weekend before. Dropped the tray table and had pretzel crumbs land in my lap. That shouldn’t happen on a plane that should’ve just been cleaned based on COVID-19 protocols, should it? Wipe it off and move on. Got it. Then we noticed the spilled drink residue on my wife’s tray table and, the ceiling?!! Wait, and we look out the window to see that a “chip” of the flaps is potentially missing from the wing extensions for take off and landing?!! Ok, same old American Airlines that I remember avoiding.

0.9799,2021-08-01,2021-08-01,20.0,American Airlines Flight Attendant says CARES Child Harness isn't allowed on flights,"Recently my wife, our 12 year old daughter and 2 year old son flew American Airlines from TUS to AUS.  The final leg of the trip was DFW to AUS.  We boarded the flight and our 2 yr old was sitting in the middle seat next to me (aisle) and our daughter (window). We have been flying with a CARES Kids Fly Safe Airplane Harness for years without an issue.  The Harness is FAA approved and authorized on ALL US carriers.  After securing our son in the harness (which acts similarly as a car seat for small children), a flight attendant walked by and took an interest in the harness.  She returned a short time later with another FA who abruptly and rudely told me that the harness was not allowed on any American Airlines flight because it posed a safety risk.  I advised that it was FAA approved and she said she didn't care - it was not approved on American Airlines aircraft she said.  She ordered me to remove it.  I had the distinct impression had I argued the point, I could have faced legal ramifications or arrest for interference with flight crew.  I was furious.  But, I relented and removed the harness.  Flight was delayed.  The FA came back a short time later and told me she was on the phone with her supervisor and asked to see the FAA label.  I showed it to her.  She returned a moment later and told me that while AA forbids ANYTHING to attach to the seat, they would allow us to use the harness ""this time"" but only in the window seat - as if it was a huge favor.  While the FA eventually relented, the fact is that it is a definite issue if a seasoned American Airlines FA didn't know that the only FAA approved child safety harness was authorized for use on this flight.  It is on the FAA website, the AA website AND in the American Airlines flight manual.  Yet this FA - argued with me that it was not allowed.  And, when she finally allowed me to use it, she still refused to admit that it was allowed.  So either she still didn't know, or she allowed me to use a device she believed to be restricted on AA aircraft.  Either way, its not reassuring.  Long story short - if you use a CARES Kids Fly Safe harness, make sure to go to the CARES website and print off all the FAA paperwork.  Also, check on the AA website and print off the AA policy.  Apparently their employees are not clear on them.And if this wasn't bad enough, American does not allow early boarding for those of us with young children.  DO none of them have toddlers and understand it takes extra time to situate kids on a flight?  This makes no sense.","{'neg': 0.067, 'neu': 0.811, 'pos': 0.122, 'compound': 0.9799}",0.9799

I had landed at DFW at 2:30 pm August 1 and expected a four hour layover so I didn’t carryon what I would need if I planned to spend the night. As my flight was getting delayed and gates were changed I approached the AA gate agent to find out if the flight would actually take off. The airport at our destination closes at 10 pm typically as no flights land after 10. She said that they could request that the airport stay open. Is that possible? When they finally boarded us, it was 11:30 pm with an estimated 1:30 am arrival. This didn’t seem possible but they did put us on the plane. The pilot arrived after we were boarded and announced that there was a maintenance issue and we should take off after it is addressed. Apparently, the toilet was making a funny noise which sounds vaguely like BS. Well, the issue stalled take off for about 45 more minutes when the pilot announced that he ran out of time and had to go. Somebody said he is running off. No more announcements for 15 minutes. We received text messages informing us that our flight was canceled. After a few more minutes the flight attendant said we needed to get off the plane. It is now 1 am, hotels are full, no rental cars are available and Uber is charging people exorbitant amounts to get to a hotel. On top of that, we no longer have valid tickets and if we leave the airport, we can’t get back in. The AA gate agent who had assured us we would get this flight out said we should go to another terminal - from terminal B to A gate 21 because there is a shorter line there at the customer service station. It turns out that station had been closed for a while and every employee I found and asked about when they were going to open said 6:30 am and everyone knows it is not open all night. Yes, the gate agent sent us to a closed customer service station to get rid of us knowing we would be stranded all night in the airport. Hold time to call AA was 4-7 hours at this point. AA only offered a Wednesday flight to me online when flights were available for Monday. I ended up having to purchase a ticket for $400 to fly out on Monday. I was on hold for 3 hours. On Monday, our gate was changed 3 times and we were delayed for hours. At the second gate, the AA gate agent was purposely setting off the alarm and announced that there was a maintenance issue. I wasn’t the only one who noticed that AA employees were actively sabotaging flights and stranding passengers. I hope they understand that they endangered the health and safety of thousands of people. Staff and AA failed to care. I seriously recommend taking a different airline and do whatever possible to not fly through DFW. I called for help on the white phones and they didn’t help at all even when I told them there were infants and small children sleeping on the floor. They didn’t even offer water.

The reason first is in quotation marks is because this particular plane has an actual first class cabin and business cabin but they're both sold/marketed as first.  I originally was in the actual first class but the night before was bumped to the biz seat.  A bit of a let down since I booked this particular flight for this cabin but not the end of the world.  There was one issue checking in (luggage) at the terminal.  The electronic kiosks weren't working so we (everyone else trying to use the kiosks) had to wait in line to speak with an AA rep to check bags.  The rep was really nice and was able to get me back in a window seat but not my original seat.  Boarding was quick and we pushed back from the gate roughly on time.  The seat itself is nice with lots of room and a large monitor.  The only thing I didn't like was the angle of the seat made it hard to see out of the window.  It was nice to be served a meal on a short flight and I was surprised to get actual metal utensils.  The food was pretty good but nothing amazing.  The service was nice and the staff were friendly.

0.982,2021-08-01,2021-08-01,10.0,EPIC FAIL,"August 2, 2021, a day that shall live in infamy in the American Airlines Legacy.  That is the day American Airlines lost me, a million miler with AA and (of course) initially USAIR.  I will tell you that USAIR was a customer centric organization and I gave many KUDOS to management because delivering a true service to consumers day in and day out starts at the top.  The lack of delivering a truly excellent service day in and day out is the fault of management for the same reason.  The post COVID American Airlines experience is terrible if not consistently terrible.Today started out by our getting up at 5 AM to get on a direct flight from LAX to Boston.  The 405 north was unusually light and I thought this to be an omen of good things to come with our trip.  This was not to be the case.Let's start at the gate.  Gate agents for our flight 2455 were overwhelmed to say the least.  Several flights were being moved between gates, and the voices of these agents were at once condescending and harsh.  There were a couple of hispanic women at the gate waiting area that were clearly not from the US that were caring for an infant.  They asked me in Spanish for help.  Their flight to Dallas/Ft. Worth  was to depart at our gate (42B) seemed to be in a state of flux (I went online and there were no updates, gate TBD).  So, after my flight was cancelled (we will get to that in a moment) I agreed to help the women translate with the gate agent.  I asked the gate agent for guidance as to where the flight would depart to Dallas Ft. Worth for our new lady friends and the agent fumed ""why are they still here?  I told them where to go!! Why are they coming back to this gate.  I can't walk every person to their flight. "" I told her that her anger was misplaced, these women did not speak English and were frozen in their fear to be alone and in need of help.  I demanded that she disclose to me the terminal and gate number that the flight would depart from and the agent lost it.  I took a page from the Germans and asked her what her name was.  She did not tell me but calmly wrote down the terminal and gate number.  I wrote instructions for the ladies in Spanish and sent them on their way.  Ok, now to my personal American Airlines debacle (made a little better by the fact that I was able to take some stress out of the day for our new friends).  Our flight gets cancelled, my wife's confirmation code was  inadvertently changed thus taking her off of my itinerary.  Two confirmation codes.  I try to rebook online, I have status, now she does not.  Could not book fast enough.  Every time I booked my flight and went to put her on, the flight sold out because of the number of flights cancelling, and so on.  I call American Airlines customer service and agree to a 2 hour call back.  I get the call back and the automated system hangs up on me.  So I call again, getting an hour and a half lead time (this time) to talk to a human.  Well guess what?  A human called!!  I told the agent about what happened and that I wanted to cancel the return leg of my flight.  She did it, I asked her to send the bags to my home and what did she do?  She placed me into an endless cue to speak to baggage claim.  Now, she committed to stay on the phone with me until the call connected to baggage claim but that didn't happen.  So where am I now?  Sipping cocktails in the Delta SkyClub (they allow AMEX Platinum card holders free access).  My wife has a platinum card as well so we are both in here enjoying the Delta Hospitality (making the best out of this disastrous day).  Where are my bags?  American says they are still on the plane (the flight that was cancelled).  American Airlines is playing the COVID card like so many other weaker management teams are doing around the country (my partners and I call this failure under the cover of COVID).  While American makes up excuses, I will make sure to make my DELTA Airlines challenge miles to maintain status with them as I will no longer fly the airline I have flown 1 million miles plus on.  Today, I started out planning on getting home safely and on time from my (former) choice airline, American; instead, I am on a Delta red-eye.  I guess my golf clubs will get to my home sooner or latter....","{'neg': 0.063, 'neu': 0.833, 'pos': 0.104, 'compound': 0.982}",0.982

I wasn’t able to make any updates or changes to a pre-existing ticket on my mobile app or from their website. We got tech-support involved anf They couldn’t figure out the issue. In addition, they could not give me any due date as to when the problem could be fixed. So they told me that I needed to create a whole new reservation.I told him that’s fine just give me my refund and I will look for a flight later. They would not give me a refund because they said they didn’t want me going to any competitor airline and then I had to make a change right then and there, Mind you it’s 12 AM. They also said that if I didn’t make a change now they can’t communicate to another supervisor my issue and that that supervisor would handle the situation how he wanted.I was very upset because they weren’t thinking about me the customer they were only thinking about themselves the company. He kept saying I needed to give him a valid reason as to why I needed a refund. My reason was I was offered a service and I was promised certain benefits from using their airline and I wasn’t given That. Therefore, if they are not keeping up with their side of the bargain then I deserve my refund. He wouldn’t accept it.So how did it end? Well since American Airlines wasn’t able to figure out why their system wasn’t working they told me that I had to buy a whole new ticket and hopefully that would resolve the problem. That and I rely on having that flexibility as a customer mainly because my schedule shifts around often.I felt like my hand was definitely forced.So I had to buy a new flight which was $30 more than my original ticket because that was my best option at the time. Entire experience just made my blood boil. I really did not feel valued as a customer and felt like I was just another number. Therefore I choose not to use this airline ever again I will be looking into their competitors a lot more for any future or upcoming flights.","{'neg': 0.028, 'neu': 0.854, 'pos': 0.118, 'compound': 0.982}",0.982

I devoted my entire holiday season, including Christmas and New Years to taking care of COVID-19 patients. I have not travelled by air in a while. I was lucky enough to be vaccinated several weeks ago and thought that it would be an acceptable risk to fly to see family for a weekend. I was very wrong. My flight with Delta was a fantastic experience. All passengers were wearing masks, and flight attendants would remind them to pull the masks up if they were not wearing them over their noses. The boarding process was slow with plenty of space between patrons. The middle seat in each aisle was left empty to promote social distancing. The flight attendants were wearing appropriate masks and offered Purell packs for cleaning when you got on the plane. Water and snacks were served in individual bags with the instruction to keep your mask up between sips or bites if you chose to partake. The process for disembarking the plane was even socially distanced. Passengers were asked to remain seated until those in front of them were up the aisle with their bags. Overall, I felt relatively safe the entire time flying with Delta. My flight with Southwest back was an entirely different experience. People were crowding against each other while boarding. The plane was packed to the brim without a single open seat. When I asked the flight attendant at the front whether they were keeping middle seats open for social distancing, he laughed at me. The cabin was hot with all the bodies packed in. People took off their masks or pulled them down so that noses were exposed, and the flight attendants said nothing. The flight attendants were not even wearing appropriate masks- they were wearing the type that infectious disease studies have found are not as effective. If Southwest thinks that their waiver before flying is doing any good (the one that says you do not have COVID-19 symptoms/exposures), they should strongly reconsider their stance on that. There were multiple passengers repeatedly coughing without masks and sniffling throughout the flight. Disembarking from the plane was a similar crowded disaster as boarding. I felt unsafe the entire flight.My experience with Southwest was a slap in the face to healthcare workers who have sacrificed so much during this pandemic. Southwest disregarded the health and safety of all its patrons present on my flight.","{'neg': 0.051, 'neu': 0.839, 'pos': 0.11, 'compound': 0.9823}",0.9823

I was not aware that American Airlines stopped practicing 'social distance seating', when I asked the stewardess about this she proceeded to yell as me in front everyone in first class and anyone else within earshot. 'Karen' told me I was free to leave the plane and rebook a less filled flight because this one was ""fully booked"".  'Karen' lectured me about airlines offering 'social distance seating' as a courtesy not as a requirement. 'Karen' continued to lecture me on how airlines couldn't make money if they didn't sell seats. For the next hour, 'Karen' frequently stopped by my seat to continue to harass me. I would also like to say that my connecting flight, on American Airlines was also filled to capacity. 10 days before, I had flown Delta and the experience was wonderful and 'social distance seating' was in practice. Travelers were offered hand sanitizer and wipes along with a bag with snacks and a water. American Airlines provided absolutely nothing. After being stuffed on both flights like sardines, at the end of each flight the captain announced that upon leaving the aircraft, travelers were expected to follow social distancing practices by leaving the plane one row at a time....WHAT A JOKE!! I sent a complaint to American Airlines customer service. This was their response: Hello Susan:Thank you for contacting Customer Relations. My name is Emma and I'm here to help.First and foremost, I sincerely regret the poor customer service experience you had onboard your flight to Charlotte on Friday. I can absolutely understand your frustration with being embarrassed repeatedly by our flight attendant. That's never the kind of experience we want you to have with us and I'm disappointed you did not receive the treatment you deserve from Karen.American continues to limit the number of customers on each aircraft. Additionally, American Customer Service agents also may reassign seats to create more space between customers or to accommodate families who need to be seated together. Once boarding is complete — taking in consideration any aircraft weight or balance restrictions — customers can move to another seat within their ticketed cabin subject to availability. As more people get back to traveling and loads are higher, American has deployed new tools to notify customers and allow them to move to more open flights when available, all without incurring any cost.I'm truly sorry that you have perceived a lessening of the warm, friendly and professional attitude we expect our people will project. I've made your comments available to the appropriate management personnel so that we can ensure better service moving forward.Susan, we appreciate you very much and hope to welcome you onboard a future AA flight.

Almost makes me wish they were my preferred airline now. To begin with, they're the only US airline still making a solid commitment to keep seats open during COVID. Some say they'll ""try,"" while others admit they do nothing. But Delta actually does. Flight attendants and check-in crew were actually very nice -a notable departure from United. They're still giving you a free snack and drink on short domestic flights. Not much, but it's better than some. Free movies even on a 2 hour flight. Basic economy does mean a surcharge for checked luggage, and it doesn't guarantee seats together. But with flights not running full during COVID, I figured it was a risk worth taking, and I was right. No one is getting stuck in that middle seat these days.

The trip was a once-in-a-lifetime experience and, of course, not everything was perfect, but the trip was memorable.  When we woke up the morning of our flight home-- Anchorage to Minneapolis and Minneapolis to Sioux Falls, SD, we had a notification that our flight was delayed for an hour- which was great as we did some additional sightseeing before dropping the rental car off. We checked in at the airport and made our way through TSA without problems and then sat at our gate. Not long after, the flight was delayed for another hour, and then another hour. At this time, they did announce that there was a problem with the plane and they were working on fixing it. Great, as I would rather they fix the problem prior to my boarding and flying for 4+ hours. And since we had a three+ hour lay-over, we were still good to make our connection. Then came the delay of another hour and a half-- which meant we would not make the connection and so my husband went up to talk with the representative. The rep gave him two $15 vouchers for food and said the hotel would be taken care of in Minneapolis. Not exactly what we'd hoped or expected, but still going with the flow. Delta ended up taking a plane that was scheduled to go to Seattle and finally, we were on our way-- 5 hours after the originally scheduled flight. The flight went great and even though the stewardesses were also thrown a curve-ball as they too would not be going home, but would be spending the night in Minneapolis, they were awesome and had a great attitude. We landed in Minneapolis and debarked and since we had decided the celebration deserved it, we had flown first class and were the first off the plane and the first to the podium.  Here is where everything took a turn.... my husband was up there for a long time and the extra person actually came around and began handing out pre-made vouchers to passengers by name. When all was said-and-done, there were four families that were told, ""Sorry, but we used up all of the allotted rooms so you are on your own."" They were very nice about it, giving us a little over-night package and one even showing us where she would sleep if she ever had to spend the night in the airport. No hotels were recommended and there was No assistance with getting a hotel room and there was definitely No compensation since the hotel that was a DELTA partner was full. Worst experience ever and I will never fly Delta again and I will never recommend Delta to anyone.

I was so happy, Alaska's first class was great, we took one trip trying Delta Vacations, as Alaska vacations disappeared. The first class experience was amazing on Delta and we got an American Express Delta card and flew both Alaska and Delta. That first trip on Delta was the only truly first class experience, since then, down hill.  The service is terrible, food is awful, drinks are minimal (very few options, like in the past), the snacks (which I eat too many of because I am hungry due to the food service being what I would call gross food.

I do not feel like I am special, we worked hard to fly first class and spent many younger years in coach, if we pay for First Class, we should receive First Class service.

Fortunately I was able to make the times work, although I had to make changes to my itinerary.While making my reservation, American offered the opportunity to make my fare refundable for an additional $200. I declined that offer, figuring it wasn't likely the fare would drop. That turned out to be a poor decision, because a few months later the price dropped by literally 50%. Had I gotten a refundable fare, I could have canceled my flight, gotten a full refund and booked again at half the price.One thing I DID pay for when making my reservation was a Main Cabin Extra seat. On the day of my flight while checking in at the airport, I saw that American had moved me to a middle seat in the back of the plane. I would have to pay an ADDITIONAL $200 if I wanted a Main Cabin Extra seat up front. I was annoyed, but agreed to pay it, opting for a seat in a row that appeared to be empty. That turned out to be money well spent because no one tried to move and I got the entire row to myself for the duration of the flight. Getting to lie flat and trying to sleep for the entire 10 hours and 20 minutes made a huge difference as we landed in Athens around 8 a.m. local time. I was very grateful that the flight attendants respected my desire to not be disturbed. It definitely helped that they could see my seat belt was fastened and I wore my face mask the entire time. I also downloaded and used the American Airlines' affiliated app ""VeriFly"" for my trip to Greece. It was very helpful on the way there, as American verified my vaccination certificate and ensured I completed the Passenger Locator Form (PLF) required by the Greek government for all incoming passengers. Getting it setup and finding my way around was a bit confusing at first, but a breeze once I completed everything on my checklist and was certified ready to fly.This was my first time flying internationally since COVID and I could tell that everyone, from the pilots and flight attendants to the passengers were trying to offer/have the best experience possible despite the circumstances. Given the uncertainty of variants and other viruses bound to develop in the future, enhanced protocols could very well be the new normal.","{'neg': 0.044, 'neu': 0.857, 'pos': 0.099, 'compound': 0.9843}",0.9843

Unfortunately I was notified the morning of departure that the flight was cancelled due to the tropical storm that was to impact the east coast that day.  I called American Airlines, afraid my trip would be ruined.  Customer service put me on a very early flight for the following day and were able to change my return flight to a day later so that I could extend our trip by 1 day (and not lose any time).  They did this at no extra charge to me.  The flight change ended up working out great!  I actually gained a few hours in Sedona thanks to American Airlines.  I had never had to deal with a cancelled flight before and they made it foolproof for me!  On the day my son and I were to depart back to NY, we missed the return flight due to the car service arriving 2.5 hours late to pick us up.  Traveling with my son (a child) I was very nervous of what might now happen...if we would be stranded in Arizona with no hotel and no flight.  I also had poor cell phone service so every time I went to call AA I ended up getting disconnected.  Once I arrived to the airport, at bag check-in, the attendant was super helpful.  She worked very quickly and gave me the two best options, and my son and I were able to grab a snack and catch a flight within an hour or so.  Again, just as I ever had a cancelled flight, I also never missed a flight either.  AA was understanding and accommodating in BOTH situations!!  These mishaps could have potentially ruined my short vacation, but thankfully AA made sure that didn't happen!!I also hadn't traveled on AA in quite a few years. It seemed the various plane cabins we were on were upgraded (even in the basic economy section!).  Everything was very clean.  We had more leg room and with our return flight we even had touch video screens on both planes, which was a welcomed perk.  AA staff did a great job spacing people out on the plane.  My son and I had a row to ourselves on each flight.  They made sure people felt safe, especially traveling during Covid-19.  I also saw people ask to re-arrange their seating so that families could sit together and they arranged that as well.","{'neg': 0.052, 'neu': 0.834, 'pos': 0.114, 'compound': 0.985}",0.985

0.9855,2022-01-01,2022-01-01,10.0,The second day of stupid,"So, our Friday night flight was cancelled.  After over an hour on the phone to find a new flight, the only option available was Monday night - 3 days later.By the time we got to the baggage claim, no bags.  Walked to ticket counter - no bags and no Delta Employee.  Our ride was waiting, so we left without our 6 checked bags.We returned to the airport in the morning to get our bags, my husband waited in the car, so he could drop me right at the bag claim.  I was told at the unclaimed bag desk that because our flight was cancelled, our bags would have been kept at the ticket counter.  I walked to to the ticket counter, and had the unfortunate experience of having to work with Dwayne.  Dwayne, the Delta employee at the Spokane Airport ticket counter was the most condescending and unhelpful person I have encountered recently.  Dwayne should not “work” (if you can call what he does for customers work) in a service position.I am wearing a beanie and a big jacket and his first response to me was “oh my God, you scared me”.  He then looked down at the luggage cart I’d brought with me for 6 bags and said, “what is that?”I let him know I was hear to pick up my bags, as our flight was cancelled.  He then talked to me like I was a child, informing me that “bags aren’t collected here”.I explained, again, the situation.  I explained that I had already been to baggage claim, that I had talked with someone at the baggage counter who called someone at the ticket counter to confirm the bags would be here.  He then asked me for my confirmation number, which I had on my Delta App and gave him.  He then asked for my baggage claim  tracking number, which I didn’t have on me.Dwayne finding a perfect opportunity to not be helpful or do his job held up a random baggage ticket sticker, tapped on it for me, I’m case I didn’t see it being held in front of my face, and said that I needed to provide him this ticket, which I would have been given if I checked my bags.  I told him, again, I don’t have it on me.  I then asked, if he has my name, my tracking number, and someone has confirmed our bags are here, why do I need it.  To which he said, “It is going to make it easier for me to find your bags.”  I asked him what he would do if I had lost it (I knew it was in my carry on in the car), he said that it would be harder to find my bags then.  I asked him to do it the “hard” way then, which was literally walking back to the place they would store bags for folks whose flights were cancelled, and he replied, “could you just go get the bag confirmation, please”.  I said, “so you aren’t going to help me unless I walk all the way back to the baggage claim car waiting area and get this stupid ticket”.  And he literally mmmhmmmd me.  The sound, “mmmhhhhmmm” was his response to me.So, I walked BACK down to the baggage claim, met my husband, got the ticket, and my husband joined me back inside to deal with Dwayne, cause I would not be spoken to that way again.  We waited in line for ten minutes to get back to the PRIORITY counter, and we were greeted by Dwayne asking “did you get it?  Did you get it?”  My husband handed Dwayne the baggage tracking tickets, and Would you be surprised to hear that Dwayne did NOTHING with them but COUNT them.  No scan, no look up the super special bag tracking number in the system to solve the mystery of where our bags were, nope!  None of that.  He just COUNTED them and asked, “so, six bags”?  Then walked down the hallway to where they put bags and AMAZING!!  The magic tickets led him to where our bags were.Good Job, Delta.  I can’t wait to watch another preflight video where you tell me all the wonderful things you are doing to make my travel safe and comfortable - clearly that is a lie.You shouldn’t force people to give you even one radio button.

Unfortunately, next to my seat is a big dog, and the dog owner let the dog came up on the seat and breathing to my face. I don’t know if the dog has covid or any contagious diseases. I didn’t feel comfortable with the dog, so I asked to change my seat back to the original one 21F, which is the window seat. But the Delta employees said that “your seat is changed, and you don’t feel comfortable to sit next to the dog, so you have to sit any available seat.” They force me have to accept the other uncomfortable seat or I have to sit next to the big dog. They changed my seat from original comfortable to uncomfortable. I paid $40 more for the service that I can change my seat to a better seat. But they changed my seat again and again to the worse ones instead. I have asthma, and I allergic to animals fur, but they don’t care, and they treated an animal better than a human. They moved me instead of the dog.After that, 2 of the Delta employees treated me differently. I said “thank you” to the one who served me with trash picking up, but she didn’t say “you are welcome” to me as she did to everyone else. Another one spoke to me rudely “step here!” while I was waiting to go to restroom. They rude to me and treated me different just because I don’t feel comfortable with the dog!

0.9878,2020-08-01,2020-08-01,50.0,The best service I’ve had so far!,"My southwest flight was my first flight ever. Among the horror stories, I had my worries that I would be one of them. Traveling by myself to Houston for specialty surgery was already enough pain and hassle so I definitely didn’t want anything else to make my trip unbearable. My departing trip was pretty much hassle free. First 2 bags check in free, snacks and water aboard the flight, phone was dead and an attendant gave me her entire portable charger for the entirety of the flight to use, and the seating wasn’t too bad on my back either. The flight was non stop and quick, just how I wanted it. News of the hurricane coming scared me though so all my surges got bunched together and the stress about flying back in time so I wasn’t stranded was looking over me. Southwest made it easy at first to change my flight time to get me home ASAP. When I arrived to the airport though, the service was spotty. Some attendants were rude and unresponsive while others were very cheerful and happy to help. I disregarded the rude ones seeing as the airport was so big and it was inevitable. But after waiting for a wheelchair because of my mobility issues, and not being talked to as I waited there, I ended up missing my flight and then being told I wouldn’t be able to fly out anymore. I spoke with several different people who gave me several different answers about flights before ultimately being put on a 6 hour flight which I wasn’t very happy about but I was okay with at the time because I would at least be safe from the hurricane. Flying out was a breeze and besides the pooping in my ears the entire time I was content for once.I wasn’t met with a wheelchair when I got off of the plane and had to limp across the airport to my next gate. Tired and out of breath I approached two attendants, Jose Acosta and Claudia Stokes who instantly noticed I needed assistance and spring into action. Claudia verified my tickets and apologized for not being helped initially.l while Jose quickly got me a wheelchair to be seated in. Not only were they very apologetic on everyone’s behalf, they were doing everything in their power to make things right. Jose wheeled me around to grab food and a drink while having good Candid conversation and Claudia checked in on me as well afterwards. They both are the very definition of customer service and accurately represent exactly what any company would want to portray. They have made my ENTIRE trip better in a matter of moments and have brightened my mood even after multiple surgeries solely with their smiles and friendly approachable attitudes. They are what the face of Southwest should be and everyone else should look high and follow in their footsteps. From the bottom of my heart, Thank you Claudia and Jose!","{'neg': 0.055, 'neu': 0.824, 'pos': 0.121, 'compound': 0.9878}",0.9878

0.9879,2021-01-01,2021-01-01,20.0,"Pretty standard flight, until we hit unexpected severe turbulence","American Airlines Flight 2334DFW-PHL4:40 pm-8:48 pm Airbus A321My wife and I recently took this flight home from Dallas/Fort Worth to Philadelphia after connecting from an American Eagle flight from Aspen. For the most part, the flight was standard, with lots of extra space on a mostly-empty older A321. However, some severe turbulence before we arrived in Philadelphia led to a surprisingly scary end to the flight.We had no problem making it from Terminal E to Terminal A at DFW for this flight using the Skylink train. Our connection was slightly over an hour and we had plenty of time to change terminals and stop for a quick lunch before boarding. The far end of Terminal A where this flight boarded (Gate A11) was also spacious between gates, with lots of space to spread out while waiting.The flight started boarding early, but we didn’t rush to board, since I knew it wasn’t going to be a full flight from looking at the seat map. Boarding was very civilized and calm. During boarding, a flight attendant handed out the standard bag that includes hand sanitizer wipes, a small bottle of water, and Biscoff cookies. As we made our way toward the back of the aircraft, it was obvious that some of the other flight attendants were doing the bare minimum, standing in their assigned spots of the aircraft on their phones, not even looking up at all to greet or assist passengers.We had a row of three seats to ourselves with standard legroom in the middle/back of the plane, and there were lots of empty seats and rows around us, so everyone was able to have their own space. The aircraft was one of the older legacy-US Airways A321s that we often have on flights to/from Philadelphia, which have basically no amenities at all (no power outlets, TVs, etc.), but we’re used to them and usually find them to be comfortable enough with ok legroom in economy.We left the gate about 5 minutes early and took off very quickly. Wifi was available on the flight, with some items offered for free, including a variety of movies and tv shows to stream. The flight was totally uneventful for the most part, until the pilot made an announcement as we approached Philadelphia that the seatbelt sign was going to be turned on early for the duration of the flight, due to potential turbulence as we began our descent into PHL. I expected this turbulence to be the typical bumps on any flight, but I was definitely not prepared for how intense it became. Out of nowhere, the sky got extra dark and clouded-over, and the plane started dropping and then lurching pretty violently from side to side. There were several drops that had a distinct roller coaster feel to them, and some of the side-to-side movement was pretty intense just from looking ahead and seeing how tilted the cabin was in front of us. At one point, some sort of red emergency lights came on in the cabin, and we were honestly quite scared and holding on tightly to our seats. We were in this intense turbulence for probably about 10 minutes, but it felt like much longer. I normally don’t get scared or bothered at all when a flight is turbulent, but this felt like nothing I had experienced on a flight in the past. When we finally got out of the turbulence, the pilot came back on and apologized for the scary ride, saying that none of their forecasts had shown any turbulence to that extent at any point on our route. As we continued our descent into PHL, there was still quite a bit of turbulence, which now felt much more like the normal kind, and I think everyone on board was relieved when we touched down safely. I know that we objectively were probably never in any potential harm based on what I know about airplanes, but it was the first time I have ever been on a flight and wondered if we’d make it to the ground ok. I know that it wasn’t just us who felt that way, because I saw one of the flight attendants, who also appeared shaken, make a call to the cockpit once we landed to ask what exactly had just happened.Despite the harrowing end of the flight, we made it to our gate in Philadelphia 30 minutes early, which was great. We landed in Terminal C, but the airport exit in Terminal C was closed at the time, so we had to walk down to Terminal B to get to baggage claim. By the time we got there, which didn’t take particularly long, our bags were already out on the carousel, which was very impressive. This flight from DFW-PHL started out seeming like a very standard one, with plenty of space and a standard bare-bones A321 cabin. However, the unexpected severe turbulence as we approached PHL was quite scary and unlike any flight we had been on before. I could not wait to get off of the plane.","{'neg': 0.06, 'neu': 0.843, 'pos': 0.096, 'compound': 0.9879}",0.9879
0.9879,2021-03-31,2021-03-31,3.0,"""LAS is just a really dirty airport overall""","  | For such a newly improved airport, McCarran sure is trash! This is the worst practically new airport I've seen anywhere in the world. I don't know what the casino revenues collected in Vegas, or even the airport itself, are going toward, but it sure isn't toward having a meaningfully modern, efficient airport, despite the many years and dollars spent on revitalization. For the pros - 1) Baggage claim was actually efficient. 2) Signage inside the airport was ample. That's about it. As for the cons? 1) There is no efficient means to take a rideshare or taxi, as the wait for either can be over an hour. It took me 40 minutes and I felt lucky compared to the people around me. 2) There's no effective means of public transportation to the Strip and this is considering that the airport is practically on the Strip! Not even a monorail. 3) The terminals have mostly new, though very depressing and uninviting, architecture and design. 4) The terminals were poorly lit, in both the late evening and early morning. 5) I saw a tiny handful of anyone working in the airport who smiled, or who otherwise just didn't look angry. 6) Airline (baggage claim) and security personnel were almost entirely ill-mannered and officious. Not just ""having a stressful morning and need coffee,"" but flat-out rude. 7) Apparently this airport doesn't believe in automated check-in and baggage machines, even though they're chock full of them, Alaska, Frontier, Southwest, etc. weren't operating theirs, and required their passengers to stand in long lines (of course, if you checked in in advance and have no baggage to claim, this isn't a problem for you). 8) LAS is just a really dirty airport overall, plain and simple. 9) Practically nothing was open in the airport at either 9pm or 6am, I guess this isn't a huge deal to me only because we're still in the midst of a pandemic. I understand that LAS has to interact with a never-ending array of passengers who don't even understand clear airport signage or etiquette, but I would respectfully suggest that LAS look to Salt Lake City (stunning new airport with overall great service) or even Phoenix (which is above-average but not great) as examples of how to operate a respectable airport.","{'neg': 0.067, 'neu': 0.79, 'pos': 0.143, 'compound': 0.9879}",0.9879
0.9879,2021-06-01,2021-06-01,10.0,Abandoned Daughter at gate,"#MichellesLifeMatters.Finding it hard to celebrate Independence Day this year.  Just this last Sunday my handicapped daughter Michelle was left abandoned at a Chicago Ohair airport gate by her American Airlines escort. I can hear you saying now ""Mike what does this have to do with Independence day?"". Let me explain one of the quotes of the declaration of Independence imbedded in my head from childhood and school. ""all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of happiness"". We have strived to give our daughter this American right, while vowing to keep her safe.  So when American Airlines told us we could send her just as if she were an unattended minor (which mentally I don't think anyone would disagree with) and they assured someone would be with her at all time, we decided to allow her to fly unattended to her brothers for her birthday.  Now the Independence Day connection: I always thought surely that with all our rights in this country we could get the word out about our experience in a free and uninterfered with manner. We have found that to be anything but the case, this is truly a testimony to the fact that some corporations have more protections than you and I as an American. You would think that someone with ""Freedom"" would be able to work with Media, advocates and lawyers if needed to get the word out.  Our experience so far has been anything but a free speech one. After my wife had a 1.5 hour interview with the local media news channel and much excitement from the reporter of getting the word out, we were later told that the publisher denied it due to fear of reprisal of the ""Federally Protected"" American Airlines. So I figured ok they don't want to stick their neck out for the handicapped over the Airlines. Where could we go from here? So we tried contacting a lawyer, now we are having much reluctance of any lawyers wanting to take on  the case for, you got it, fear of the ""Federally Protected"" American Airlines.  Now I ask you as an American, How are we free if corporations have more say to squelch and cover up the truth. I just want to get this word out as I don't want anyone else to ever have to go thru this with their child. Ok she is not a child she is 29, but I can tell you right now if I were to dump my daughter at the airport by herself now being a week later I would be in Jail , sych evals and all other kind of scrutiny since I am her guardian.  Maybe if she would have opened the airport exit or she was an ""unattended luggage""  she would have gotten more attention.  Please help me get this word out, no individual or corporation should be above the law.  As for American Airlines it has been crickets other than having their lawyer call us. I need to know how and why this happened and above all what I can do to avoid this to happen in the future.If there isn't a  law to prevent this I am completely prepared to lobby for those (disabled) that can't communicate or even fathom the danger themselves. Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of happiness was the goal back then and I feel it is still a fight today.

0.9881,2020-12-01,2020-12-01,50.0,Great Airline - working through the COVID pandemic,"We used Southwest to finally take a twice-postponed trip to Disneyworld just after Christmas. Southwest switched several months ago to allow middle row seating.  For us, we were fine because there were five of us and we took up an entire row.  It was not a completely full flight so the one empty seat remaining on the row was empty the whole time.  I was on the side of the plane with my wife and daughter.  In my experience, Southwest's customer service is far superior to other legacy airlines and also low cost airlines.   Their flight attendants are friendly but do enforce the rules - especially regarding mask usage.  Their rules regarding the way they seat their passengers takes a little getting used to but I am comfortable with it and have not had a problem keeping our party together  during flights.  For those unhappy with a seat next to them being occupied, I feel your pain but if you don't buy an extra seat that spot is fair game and you should expect to have a person sitting next to you. The best part about Southwest is their baggage and rescheduling  flexibility.  COVID may have prompted some other airlines to temporarily loosen their change fees, but Southwest has never had them.  Also being able to check two bags is wonderful.  If prices are close, I will always go with Southwest, especially due to the lack of change fees.  COVID caused us to have to reschedule this more than once and  SW was very accommodating and didn't charge us half the price of the ticket to make a change (zero $$ change fee)  It is nice to fly with an airline where I don't feel like the customers are hated or at least taken for granted. Another nice feature is they seem to have more non-stop flights than many other airlines, mainly because they have less reliance on ""hub cities""  and instead rely more on point to point flights.   We did have an automated reschedule prior to flying that booked a connecting flight after our original flight was cancelled, but they cheerfully booked us back on a  non-stop when my wife called weeks before the flight date. They are great to fly and I hope they keep their business model and are able to work through this COVID crisis.  I also read that they haven't laid off or furloughed any workers through the Pandemic unlike many of their competitors.

Upon our return the process was relatively easy however, I would recommend that if you are traveling with children make sure to purchase the pass that allows you to board early.  Southwest allows passengers to board via a number system.  We were told to line up near the window once our number was called; however, the numbers were only visible from the inside of the pole instead of on the outside.  Thus, it was somewhat difficult to find your place.  In addition, you may have to deal with disgruntled passengers who may be inclined to believe that you are cutting the line.  Unfortunately, this process resulted in my son sitting alone because there were only middle seats available once we boarded the aircraft.  Lesson learned...purchase a pass if you have children traveling with you.  Overall our experience was great....free bags, a direct flight, and on time arrival and departure.

When I’d have no choice but the fly them, I would pad my trips by 24 hours to account for the inevitable delay, cancelation, and/or missed connection that would leave me stranded overnight. The few times I made it to my destinations, my checked bags wouldn’t...So today’s flight was my first American flight in years. I had no choice because Covid rearranged the flights I would normally take with another carrier.And I have to say I was impressed. Most importantly, both flights were early. Getting stuck overnight in a layover city is annoying during the best of times, during a pandemic it could be awful. Grateful it didn’t happen. Kind of sad that getting paying passengers where you were paid to take them at the time to said you would warrants praise, but these days it does. But the reason I’m writing the review was for the awesome flight attendant handling the First Class  (it didn’t cost much more to upgrade, I’m not some oil tycoon or movie star slumming it while their own jet is in the shop).His name was Magnum—no joke; and he was as awesome as his name. Incredibly attentive service. Also hustle to get people seated quickly because he said we had a narrow window for takeoff and didn’t want us to miss it.He managed to professionally manhandle the folks that in the back that lacked the spatial reasoning ability to fit their bags in the overhead while they stood in the aisle trying every combination over and over again except the right one. Anyway, thanks to Magnum and all the folks that got me where I was going on time, I am willing to give American another shot. To;dr: used to hate American, but awesome flight attendant named ‘Magnum’ was so great I will give the brand another chance.

I flew to Austin (first flight during this pandemic) and as always the customer service is great. As soon as you stepped on the plane they gave you sanitizing wipes so you could wipe your hands and area if you chose, and immediately cane and collected all the used wipes. The planes were very clean and you felt safe. There was AT LEAST one seat between people but they gave me a whole row to myself. During the flight they gave us a pre-sealed snack kit with bottled water, hand sanitizer, and some snacks. Not a lot but it was a short flight. Also for boarding they sat people in the back first and worked towards the front so you wouldn’t have to walk past people and have as much contact, and same with debarking they had the people in front of you get ready and out first.

I choose seats where I can sit by myself since we're in the midst of a pandemic, right? I obviously can't bring a portable battery on the plane with me, right? So get this...SEVEN DAYS before my flight, AA calls me and tells me my schedule has been completely flipped around. Instead of landing at 4:30pm, my flight now lands me in Oregon at 10:50pm. So basically they took an entire day off my ""vacation"". Not just that, but this new schedule makes me wait at the Phoenix airport for SEVEN HOURS.TWICE.None of this was even slightly close to my original schedule. But I figure hey, things can't be helped, it's a pandemic, whatever.

So I get comfortable for my six hour flight, grab my phone and charger, and... Oh, there's no outlets of any kind...

Everything about the flight was very much average in terms of service and experience we’ve had while flying on American during the pandemic. The flight was totally fine and pretty unremarkable. We arrived at PHL about an hour before the scheduled 6:00 am departure and had no wait or difficulty when checking our bags using the self-tagging kiosks in the Terminal B/C check-in area. The Terminal B security checkpoint was very deserted at that time of day as well, so we were through the line quickly and off to the gate for boarding. Especially in the early morning, we’ve been finding that PHL is very dead now as compared to pre-pandemic flying.The flight boarded right on time, and flight attendants handed out hand sanitizer wipes as we boarded, which are nice to have while traveling.  We were happy to find that even though American is not blocking middle seats like some of its competitors, the flight wasn’t full, and the two of us had a full row to ourselves. Since the flight had several extra empty rows, flight attendants were also helping spread out and re-seat passengers to promote physical distancing. We left the gate almost 10 minutes early, quickly took off, and made it to Chicago about 20 minutes early, all of which was great. However, I did find the aircraft, a Boeing 737-800, to be one of the less comfortable AA aircraft I’ve been on. While the seats themselves are of a standard comfort level, legroom in standard economy definitely felt more cramped than on some of American’s Airbus aircraft that we’ve more commonly flown on in the past. However, I did appreciate that the seats had both full outlets and USB plugs for easy charging during the flight, and the phone/iPad stand at the top of the seat came in handy as well. Wifi was available on the flight, with several things offered for free, including a variety of movies, tv shows, and Apple Music to stream. I also used the AA app to track our flight and prepare for our connection in Chicago. There was no service on this flight, which was announced at the beginning. I don’t understand why they didn’t offer the little bags with a snack and water bottle in them that are handed out while boarding other AA flights, since it takes no time at all to hand them out, and there would normally have been drink and snack service on a 2.5-hour flight before the pandemic. The flight attendants did make several of the standard announcements about required mask wearing during the flight, and I didn’t see any non-compliance from passengers, so I felt safe on this flight. I would have liked if they had made an announcement asking passengers to disembark row-by-row when we got to the gate in Chicago, but they didn’t, so people jumped up as usual to clog the aisle as soon as the seatbelt sign was turned off.Overall, this flight from PHL-ORD was perfectly fine, with standard service from American. The plane was clean with enough space for us to spread out, and we made it to Chicago early, giving plenty of time to make our connecting flight.","{'neg': 0.018, 'neu': 0.881, 'pos': 0.1, 'compound': 0.9896}",0.9896

However, on my trip back to the States from Narita to DFW on January 26th, I had the most Amazing service ever! The flight was not very full so they tried to space everyone out so they had more room. I had 2 open seats next to me that I was able to lay down and take a nap. The Stewardesses on that flight made sure everything was perfect. They checked on me and we had some good short conversations. I shake due to a brain injury and they always came by to make sure I was warm enough and to see if I needed anything to drink. I did spill a coke and told them and they helped me clean it off my tray and gave me a new blanket. They opened all my food lids for me. I mean it was Amazing. I didn’t feel as if it was a pity party, but just blessed to have these Angels on board that day. It was above and beyond all expectations.

I rushed out to the gate only to find that the plane had left early. This amazing gate agent (Denzo) somehow got me onto the last flight of the day from SAN to JFK ASAP, which was amazing because this flight was scheduled to leave right around the same time as the one which I had originally booked!!!!Flight #1 on my trip was a bit rocky, but, I mean, that's to be expected when landing in Salt Lake City. Flight #2 was amazing, though. In spite of a thunderstorm warning, the plane, under Pilot Mark Naro, smoothly soared during the entire flight.I am, moreover, impressed by how effectively Delta instituted social distancing measures. Increased air cirulation in the cabins, distancing enabled by empty middle rows, rigerous sanitation, and face covering all left me feeling far more safe than I could have imagined: flying during COVID-19  was actually not scary!!My only complaints:1. Clarify online check-in policy. Change the section titled ""recommended check-in time"" with checked bags to ""required check-in time with checked bags."" This is seriously confusing and can risk customers missing flights.2. Provide a snack option edible for everyone. Cheeze-Its, the current snack option provided by Delta, are great in that they are vegitarian, but they are, unfortunately, an issue for anyone with lactose intolerance, which is fairly common in the US, especially among minority groups.Overall, I am thankful for Delta's amazing crew, who saved my trip and, moreover, are working ardously to keep customers comfortable as well as SAFE during the current crisis.","{'neg': 0.088, 'neu': 0.723, 'pos': 0.189, 'compound': 0.9897}",0.9897

0.99,2021-06-01,2021-06-01,10.0,Unamerican Airlines,"Let's begin with the fact that I will never fly American Airlines again. Even though they are the only airline that flies out of Waco Airport (ACT), I will drive to Austin or Dallas to reach my destination through Southwest Airlines. Chapter One - The Flight CreditI had a flight scheduled right before the COVID-19 pandemic hit that was cancelled due to the world coming to a screeching halt. No worries, I'm tech savvy and consider myself an extroverted introvert. However, I had a flight credit burning a hole in my wallet that I could finally use. I tried to use this credit online, but to no avail. Apparently I had to call and speak to a Reservation Specialist to click OK on a keyboard to make the reservation for me. Four hours later, the time being 11:35PM I believe, I finally received a call stating I am next in line to speak to a representative regarding my reservation. After explaining the situation, the representative begins finding the reservation I just handed to him on a silver platter and says it will cost me $200.00 to use the credit. With my curiosity piqued I asked the reason for this charge. He proceeded to tell me that it was because this was a new destination and not the one I had originally booked over a year ago. You can imagine how the rest of that conversation went, however the ending threw me for a loop. After saying that he would speak to someone who could indeed make the call to correct this wrong, I hear a click and begin seeing red. Yes you are correct, the man did indeed hang up on me to sweep under the rug. However, I am a rather large man and not easily swept off my feet nor under any rug. I spoke to the Reservation Specialist Supervisor who simply read from her script ""I am sorry for the inconvenience."" I asked if there was any disciplinary action against employees who hang up on customers, because in my line of work there tend to be repercussions for negative employee behaviors and actions. At this point you could hear the tensing of her stomach as she frantically flipped through her script to find this scenario, beads of sweat beginning to form on her upper lip. Naturally she skipped to a response that was as generic as they come and I grew tired of speaking to a blank page. I ended the conversation with a question that I would grow to use frequently in the near future ""Who else can I speak to that can actually help?"" Rather than spend my nights waiting by the telephone I decided to email my issues to the next line of defence by American Airlines, Customer Relations. The next day on my way home from work I received a call from Customer Relations regarding my misfortune of using a flight credit. She proceeded to defend the individual who said he would be back but left me all alone fuming in the dark saying that he probably pushed ""End Call"" and it immediately started to ring again for another customer. Makes perfect sense because I used to use that line back in college.""I'm sorry, I must have accidentally hit ""End Call"" and it moved to the next girl in line. I'm so sorry for the inconvenience.""Doesn't matter at this point, I just wanted to use the money I had already spent with American Airlines and not incur any further hidden ""fees"" associated with using this flight credit. This call ended the same as before with another line from America's Customer Service Anthem ""I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but..."" and having 5,000 miles left on the nightstand as a tip. Not sure if you know this or not, but a 30 minute flight cost around 45,000 miles, one way. Makes a man feel cheap, ya know? Anyways, she said I needed to speak to a Reservation Specialist to finalize my flight reservation and use my credit, minus $200.00 in change fees. Another four hours drift by like sand through glass and I speak with another representative who placed me and my wife's reservation separately, because you cannot use a flight credit that has more than one passenger on a ticket. I only mention this now because it comes back later in the story. With that, we wait till the day of the flight which brings us to our second adventure. Chapter Two - The Absent AttendantHungry, tired from work, late, and masked I stand at Gate 29 in the DFW airport terminal impatiently waiting for a woman who will never show. I can see the plane outside the window, the pilot has made several coffee break visits to the door, but no boarding takes place. ""Your flight has been delayed 15 minutes"" dings across my phone as we listen to the poor souls holding the door so the tired and weary passengers don't break down the gate to get on a plane just waiting to be boarded say ""we are waiting on the flight attendant who should arrive here shortly."" How little did I know that this phrase is one I was going to hear quite frequently for the next hour. A woman stands up and makes her way to the counter around 45 minutes in and speaks with the pilot and two souls informing them that she was a flight attendant off duty but would gladly step up and work to get us off the ground. They say no at first, but another 15 minutes go by with no flight attendant in sight and they hail her from the door to save us all. Cheers from the crowd fill the terminal as she walks through the crowd of irritated passengers offering free drinks to this woman who may or may not have been God sent. After our ""brief"" delay we finally begin boarding our flight to land in LAX two hours later. Chapter Three - A Seat by Any Other Name As we begin picking up the hotel room, packing up our items for our 5:00AM flight, we remember we need to check in for our upcoming flight. As we rush to the app my wife notices our seats are quite different from what they were a few days ago. Puzzled, I investigate and surely enough she is correct. I am now at the back of the plane whilst my fair maiden lay in the middle seat at the front of our plane several stories ahead of me. Remember when I mentioned the separate flight tickets due to the credit earlier? Here is where that comes back into play. Because we had to do two separate tickets due to a flight credit testament passed down from the American Airline Gods, we were now separated on a flight leaving Las Vegas, quite tragic indeed. Not only were we separated, but both of us were taken out of our Exit Row seats and assigned to main cabin seats. Did I mention my wife and I are both over 6 feet tall, and I am not the skinny skater boy I was back in high school. So you can imagine the horror that came over me when I realized I was sitting in a very tight fit seat next to some stranger. I was able to move my seat for free to an Exit Row thankfully, but my fair maiden was not so lucky. There were several Exit Row seats available, however we were forced to pay for a seat upgrade on a seat we already upgraded so she could sit next to her Romeo and stretch her legs out on our two hour flight at 5:00AM. Which brings us to the end of our fairytale and on to...Chapter Four - Happily Never AgainSeveral emails go by with a Customer Relations Representative as I ask for the reimbursement of a seat upgrade that we were forced into after they moved us around due to equipment changes, AKA a new plane. We were reimbursed for our original seat, but that left $13.27 needed to be reimbursed for a seat change we did not plan for. Now we are blessed to not be hurting for money, but I cannot stand idly by while large corporations sit there and take advantage of the people that pay for their peanuts and tiny plastic cups. I have seen enough poor customer service to last me a lifetime and I cannot, no...I will not stand for it any longer. After waiting several days for a response, Cara Whitney copied and pasted her script into her email and said ""I must respectfully decline your request for a refund."" While I went into great detail how this is only logical, I received nothing back. I respectfully declined her response and said that I cannot accept these terms for the stated reasons, to which I typed out in great detail. The last email I received from Cara stated that she added a flight credit to my account in the amount owed to me and said that this is the best she can do. Now let us take a pause here while we look at the series of unfortunate events that led me to this conundrum I call my personal Hell. Do you see the irony? All of this began with a flight credit, and she expects this to end with one. Even I had to sit back and laugh after reading that response.I replied back stating that I must not have made myself very clear. I WILL NOT be flying American Airlines EVER AGAIN so what good is a flight credit to someone who is not flying your airline? Yet another slap in the face similar to the ""Bonus Miles"" left on the nightstand. You can credit my account for the total amount I am requesting, but not reimburse me directly? Seems odd and cruel if you ask me. Anyways, I ended the email with a note that said I get off work at 5:00PM and you can call me at that time to discuss how you can arrange my reimbursement and take back the flight credit. 5:00PM arrives and I am greeted with a call from an unknown number masking as ""Potential Spam"" but I threw caution to the wind and answered anyways. Sure enough it was Cara to tell me that she is sorry for the ___________ (entering the test portion of the novel) and that there is nothing they can do. (true / false)If you said ""inconvenience"" and circled false, you would be correct in my book. I refuse to believe that Customer Relations is the end all be all for American Airlines. If so, I feel they would have a much more distinguished title to reflect their God like abilities. However I was told that there is nowhere else I can turn to to have this resolved. No supervisor, no corporate, nothing. It has reached the end of the line and has been deemed the weakest link in their eyes. So I continue to ask for clarification so that I can understand her side more, and hope she hears the true logic and something clicks. I ask how it's fair to change a flight where you paid for an Exit Row seat to be bumped to the middle of a main cabin seat. Her response was that it looks for her EXACT seat and throws her into it. C9 may have been Exit Row on our original plane, but C9 is main cabin on the new plane. At this time there are still no lights on at home and she continues to say ""yep"" despite the illogical statements I am spitting out. I ask why they do not move seats and include extras, such as Exit Row, and she simply replied with ""cuz"". At this point I have lost all composure because I am I am trying to reason with a brick wall, or at least the person with the intellect of a brick wall. So from here there is only one thing I can do. I said I am making my story known on every platform I can think of. I did not mean to take it so literally, typing out a novel as a review of a poorly run company, but here we are. All of this to say I, nor anyone I can influence, will ever use American Airlines ever again. I hope that this novel gets published for corporate eyes to see the level of customer service that is being shown to your patrons. I hope you, as patrons, band together and let your stories be known when you are shown injustice because saying nothing means nothing will be done to fix it. I hope you aren't shown this level of poor customer service and injustice, but if you are I hope you stand with me and fight for the cause to wipe out poor customer service and injustice anywhere you can. Stand with me, and together we can make a difference. *steps off soapbox*","{'neg': 0.085, 'neu': 0.817, 'pos': 0.098, 'compound': 0.99}",0.99

I've been lied to, witnessed a clear violation of how things are supposed to be handled, and I've been ghosted.Some backstory: relocating as a remote worker. I packed my work equipment with multiple layers of bubble wrap and clothing, put them into a box, and sealed it with guerilla tape.I checked my box as an oversized special item to prevent any mishandling. The lady at the counter marked the box as fragile and oversized. She then told me that I could claim the item in a designated area as it would not drop down the conveyor belt.She then asked me to sign away all liability saying that they'll take REASONABLE care of my property but aren't liable for damages.Well, Delta's definition of reasonable care means that they'll stack boxes on top of a box marked fragile, send it over to standard baggage claim tumbling down the conveyor belt, bend the box(how?), Then the coup de grâce, puncture the box and it's content...So I see the box tumbling down the conveyor belt and I'm dmbfounded... This is not what was discussed. Its about to flip over the sides since it tumbled end over end but luckily It caught balance and landed with a thump back onto the belt.I go to the counter to explain to the lady who's clearly annoyed, what happened to my box. She asked me to test if everything in there works. I couldn't find the wires for the monitors and we ended up speaking to Scott Winters of LAX. I pointed out every bend and hole on the box saying, this isn't reasonable care.After seeing the box Scott said I can go home to buy wires and test the monitors within 24hrs, email him and then we'll work something out if it's broken. I'm guessing this was to just get me out of the airport because he later ghosted me.The next morning I got some new wires and plugged in my BenQ which worked fine. I then unwrap my dell 27"" ultrasharp ips monitor and see what appears to be a hole that's penetrated the first two layers of the screen.Naive and hopeful, I plug in the monitor thinking that it'll still work and if it's just a scratch then I can live with that. But after plugging it in That scratch started to look more like fractures as the screen begin to illuminate. It was done.I called Delta's help support number, when I finally got through to someone I barely got out half a sentence before being interrupted. The gentleman proceeded to interrupt me a few more times until I finally got my story out and after a final interruption I just hung up.I emailed Scott to update him on the progress I had made, I also sent a message via Facebook messenger to Delta to figure out how to actually put a claim in for the issue. Scott replied back thanking me for keeping him in the loop.I finally got a ticket submitted and within an hour someone had already denied my claim. I cc Scott on the email asking them to make things right. They offer me $250 travel coupon. I absolutely decline and you can remove it from my account then remove my account.I send another message to Scott, he was friendly so I'm sure he'd be willing to help, nope. He ghosted me.I've made quite a few trips with Delta in the past for work and I religiously chose them because of their seating space and how easy it is to check in. No more. I'd rather fly spirit. You all really showed how much you value the 9-5 regular Joe. I bet if I was a frequent first class passenger you all would have been way more hepful and and remorseful for your clear negligence of handling and someone else's property.","{'neg': 0.045, 'neu': 0.848, 'pos': 0.107, 'compound': 0.9908}",0.9908

First of all, I used mass transit, which connects to the airport real well, and I cant say anything negative about getting to and from the airport. I also flew AA, so I cant say anything about terminals A,C, or E, or the ease of inter terminal movement. Also, no, I do not know why there is no terminal D. As for land side B, it is a little cramped, but overall nice. Airside, however, is extremely open, airy, clean, and generally pleasant! The food options are pretty run of the mill, which was good as I showed up 2 hours before my departure to eat. Also, get a load of this, I was through standard security in 7 minutes, in New Englands busiest airport!

0.991,2020-08-01,2020-08-01,50.0,Fantastic,"I recently traveled to Atlanta to visit family back in August. Typically I would have flown Delta because I could have flown out of the nearest airport directly, but I wanted to give Southwest a try. I had traveled on the previously with large groups but had never done so solo. The ground staff at BWI were fantastic, very efficient and getting from the front door of the terminal to the gate only took about 10 minutes including security. Southwest has taken steps to help reduce the probability of transmission of COVID-19 aboard its aircraft. This was apparent during the boarding process as Southwest currently boards in smaller groups than it did before the pandemic began. Boarding was simple, but just make sure you take a look at your boarding pass before boarding begins so you know when to approach the podium. Gate agents and flight crew were fantastic, as had been my previous experience. Service was a bit less than usual (soft drinks were not available) although I believe Southwest had this posted on their website, but I was already aware of this regardless. I presume this will return once the pandemic winds down. The flight down to Atlanta was smooth. Some of the highlights include the free checked baggage (up to 2 per passenger up to 50lbs each) and the open seating. I would recommend Southwest more for vacation travel than business, but personally I would have been satisfied with them either way. Definitely a new go-to airline.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.85, 'pos': 0.15, 'compound': 0.991}",0.991

0.9913,2020-08-01,2020-08-01,10.0,Save yourself and support a better business,One of the worst flight experiences I have ever had! No customer care or a word of customer service. For the price I would most definitely choose any other airline I would and will from now on choose to even pay more for simply a good experience. American Airlines is a joke. Claiming to care about customers health they over price for there OLD non cared for planes. Even though we are in a “pandemic “  they choose to be cheap and tight wads worried about control and there bottom line. In a plane where ever customer is stuffed shoulder to shoulder touching all in the back half of the plane while the front half of the plane only had a few scattered seats being used. If they actually cared about there customers and being a good quality airline ran by quality people they would have obviously have moved customers around the airplane creating some more comfort and doing their part to protect there customers as they claim they are doing. Also as I was getting my rental car the lady there assumed I had been flying with AA because of my poor experience and that she had heard the same exact customer care from other distraught people who felt the same. Shoving everyone in the back of the plane. Not a single thing was OFFERED THE ENTIRE FLIGHT! of over 2.5 hours not a single complementary food or beverage. Claiming for the covid. So all I understand from AA is they care about control and bottom line. Over priced tickets and one of the least updated planes being on 4 of there planes through this trip not a single plane was updated like Delta flights. I took a flight from Delta not long before this flight and updated kind very nice customer service was awesome and they offered in flight food and drink. If you care about your sanity and or just simply do not want to support bad business then please do yourself a solid and fly with a better company.

Not only did Troy make us feel so special for our special day, he went above and beyond! Once we got close to landing he made us a crown out of the snack bags, and gave us a bottle of champagne and cranberry juice. He handed my husband a radio and told him to hold it... He started playing here comes the bride and also who let the dogs out for Oakley. He was by far my favorite flight attendant I have ever had and I really hope and wish to cross paths with him again!

0.9918,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,40.0,We love Delta!,"So I will start by writing that our flight TO MSP was amazing. The attendants were so sweet and accommodating. The seats were spaced apart and they were quick to fix when people were walking around unmasked. As a nurse traveling during a pandemic I was happy things were taken seriously. Our flight back however was not good. While the majority of the staff was exceptional there was an older flight attendant who was a huge grump and honestly, if you work in the service industry (as I had for 15 years) you need to keep your emotions in check. I had expected my family of four would have a whole row to themselves as we did in the first flight, but instead we didn’t. I mentioned to the stewardess that sitting two feet max from a stranger was worrisome and she stated in a very snide voice “it will be fine!” I replied “No, it’s not fine.” I shut my mouth and sat down, but the rest of the flight she wouldn’t help me. Honestly, maybe it’s time she got a new job. I am generally a very nice person but I did not like her tone or dismissive behavior. I realize I am choosing to fly in a pandemic BUT precautions still need to be made, and staff professional.I loved the fact that we had personal televisions and that we could even watch movies that were just released. I have flown with nearly every airline and I really do enjoy Delta. I feel that the crew for the most part is excellent and enjoys their work as much as one can enjoy work. The flight was on time with minimal trouble boarding. We appreciated the crew and what they are doing for us during this pandemic.We will fly Delta again.","{'neg': 0.039, 'neu': 0.801, 'pos': 0.16, 'compound': 0.9918}",0.9918
0.9919,2021-08-01,2021-08-01,40.0,Very good but much better options out there.,"I guess in Skyteam is i like most families in the 70s and 80s and Thanksgiving. You have the Adult table and then you have the kids table. Delta is at the adults table, naturally, and Air Europa is at the kids table. When started booking my trip i went to delta website 1st and noticed not all skyteam members where showing up. So at Skyteam you have the adults and the kids and in my search i found Aeroflot and Air Eruopa are 2 of the kids. Heck even a Delta reservation agent said Aeroflot is not part of Skyteam. Lol. Lets give the positive 1st cause this will be a Delta bashing thread and i hate leaving negative reviews but i had to in this case:Positive: Delta Agents could not have been any nicer or more helpful. They did the best they could do. Even the supervisor was confused when explaining the problem below.  The flight attednats where terrific. the Captain on Delta flight 2229 was the best. He even told the cabin ""please be nice to the flight attednats they did make up the mask mandate so please do not be rude to them"" he then asked for military and vets to raise their hand to thank us.Negative (sorry but this makes no sense. There is no reason 2 Alliance partners can not check bags with each other)My girlfriend and i flew from Dallas to Tenerife with no layovers. DAL to MIA on Delta and MIA to TFN on Air Europa. Delta agents a DAL said that even though Air Europa is Skyteam they could not check bags on them. So when we get to Miami 1 of our bags showed up and they other did not so a 5 hr connection turned into almost missing our plane becuase Delta can not transfer bags i guess. Air Europa on the other hand my bags both showed together at the same time as i did. Maybe Delta needs to move to the kids table and Air Europa to the adults table.I would not recommend Delta after this.  The reasons are:  with no thru checking of bags on other carriers then you can save 300 bucks from the start on Southwest. I had to use main cabin in Delta to pick my seat. Which was about 2-300 more than Southwest wanna get away fares even adding the early bird on southwest you still save money and get 2 checked bags free which saves you another 40 bucks or more per bag. AND you still have to go claim your bags and go back thru security, just like we had to with Delta/Air Europa.I had very high expectations of Delta even got the Amex Delta Platinum card but after this i will be canceling the delta card and my skymiles account as i can not see a reason to fly Delta again.  Since i harldy ever leave the US and unless Southwest goes out of business i can not justify a financial reason to fly Delta again.","{'neg': 0.065, 'neu': 0.803, 'pos': 0.132, 'compound': 0.9919}",0.9919
0.9919,2022-02-01,2022-02-01,30.0,"Pretty average flight, but rude gate agents set a negative tone","American Airlines Flight 1313PHL-DEN9:50 am-12:23 pm Airbus A321My wife and I recently took this flight from Philadelphia to Denver at the beginning of a vacation to Colorado, and it was very much a standard AA experience - not great, but not bad. Rude gate agents at PHL started things out on the wrong foot, but it was better after that. The aircraft was in decent shape and we got there early, which is pretty much a win in my book. We arrived at Philadelphia Airport about 2 hours before the flight, and the large Terminal B/C check-in area was a bit busy, but it was still easy enough to get a kiosk to self-tag and check our bags with no wait, and we were quickly on our way. We used security at Terminal C, which is for Precheck only, and it was very smooth-sailing with no wait at all. We had a couple of Admirals Club passes that were soon expiring, so we went to the Admirals Club located up the escalators and on the second floor between terminals B and C.  We had never been to this lounge in the past, and although it’s a little dated, we appreciated that it was very large with plenty of seating areas and good views of the terminals and runway. I was also happy to see that they had hot food available on the buffet, including waffles and make-your-own breakfast tacos, in addition to having a station where someone was making avocado toast to-order. They also had a variety of standard cold food options. It was a nice surprise that hot food was available based on my experiences at other airport lounges in the morning. The drink options were a little weaker, since the only things included at the bar were a very cheap house red and white wine and the absolute lowest quality liquor options. Everyone that was there, us included, was asking for typical morning drinks like mimosas, and it was annoying to be told that no sparkling wine of any type was included. Instead, we had to pay $13 for each mimosa, which wasn’t a big deal, but easily could have been complimentary and made with a basic prosecco. No one is looking for a house red wine at 8:30 in the morning.The flight started boarding a few minutes early, so by the time we got to the gate at the appointed boarding time, boarding had already begun. It was a full flight, and had the standard chaotic process that is particularly bad at many of the tight gates at PHL, including C22 where we were. When it finally got to our group (Group 5), they called us  immediately after Group 4 with no break in between, so everyone just continued boarding through the priority lane, which the gate agents were allowing. After almost all of Group 5 had boarded, the gate agents suddenly decided that Group 5 could no longer board through the priority lane and that everyone had to use the main boarding lane. Normally, this would be fine since that’s how Group 5 is supposed to board. However, they didn’t do this in an organized manner, or at the start of boarding the group like they should have. The few of us who were still lined up in the priority lane were told we couldn’t board without going to the very back of a new separate line that had now formed in the regular boarding lane. Since I was next in line, I found it totally frustrating. The gate area was extremely small, we had already waited in what had been an acceptable spot until it was arbitrarily changed, and now having to swim upstream against the crowds to get to the back of a new line was a waste of time and energy. I asked the first person in the new line if she would mind if we went in front of her for boarding since it was so crazy and we were all in the same group anyway, and she said she didn’t mind at all. I told the gate agent this and he was extremely rude. He absolutely refused to let anyone else board in the way he had started boarding our group, saying that the other passenger “didn’t have the authority to decide when and where we can board” and it just left a negative taste in my mouth because he was being totally unreasonable. Arguing with a gate agent about which side of a stanchion I’m allowed to board from is just not the best way to start a trip, especially with it being so chaotic and impossible to move around. We eventually made our way to the back of the regular line and boarded shortly thereafter.  The aircraft was an A321 in the newer configuration that’s nothing super special, but better than the old legacy-US Airways A321s that we often flew on from PHL in the past, which had no amenities at all and small overhead bins. The plane ended up having extra-large overhead bins that easily fit everyone’s carry-on bags. I also appreciated that the seats had power outlets and USB chargers, along with the newer device holders that are helpful for holding a phone or watching something on your tablet during the flight. We had also paid for Main Cabin Extra seats with extra legroom, and I was happy with our purchase. The legroom was noticeably comfortable and better than standard economy seats.We left the gate a couple minutes early, quickly took off, and generally had a smooth and uneventful flight to Denver. Wifi was available on the flight, with several things offered for free, including a variety of movies, tv shows, and Apple Music to stream. I also used the AA app to track our flight and the time until arrival.There was one beverage service early-on in the flight, which included a choice of cookies or corn nuts. There was no additional service at all, and I definitely thought there should have at least been an offer of something basic like water one more time on a 4.5-hour flight. The flight attendants instead spent a lot of time making unnecessary announcements, including a credit card pitch right in the middle of the flight, which was annoying when most people are trying to focus on a movie, reading, or sleeping. If they have to do that, it’s much better when it’s right at the beginning or end of the flight. We also didn’t love that the captain turned on the fasten seatbelt sign at the slightest hint of turbulence and would then leave it on for long periods of time. We only hit one patch of slight turbulence on an otherwise totally smooth flight, so it should have been off much more than it was.We ultimately arrived at our gate in Denver over 20 minutes early, which was great. Luggage was pretty slow to arrive at baggage claim, especially given that it takes a while to get from the gates at DEN to baggage claim. However, it wasn’t the worst experience we’ve had when it comes to baggage claim, and we were still leaving the airport earlier than expected, given the early arrival of the flight. Overall, this flight from Philadelphia to Denver was fine. It didn’t feel like anyone went out of their way to make it a great experience, and the gate agents at PHL were incredibly rude and difficult in a way that they didn’t need to be. However, I was very glad we arrived early and had an uneventful and pretty comfortable flight.","{'neg': 0.085, 'neu': 0.802, 'pos': 0.113, 'compound': 0.9919}",0.9919
0.9922,2022-02-01,2022-02-01,10.0,"Missing the event of a lifetime, thanks American Airlines","Special moments may only last a moment, but their impact lasts a lifetime. The birth of a child, a special graduation, or the marriage of your first born child spark a host of emotions and imprint beautiful memories for us to replay over and over. It was this that fueled my excitement as we boarded the shuttle at the Asheville Airport that warm Friday in February. I had shopped for just the right dress, pondered over the perfect gift to give my son and his beautiful soon-to-be bride. My first born child was reaching a milestone in his life that a mother cherishes. Oh and I did. Pride, love, excitement, all welled up in me as I anticipated celebrating this moment with my family. Our excitement landed us at the airport an hour and forty-five minutes before our scheduled flight. At flight check-in, the attendant told us that our flight was delayed but not to worry, we have plenty of time to make our connecting flight. We got through the security check points and settled into our chairs after checking in at the gate. We would have to wait as the attendant at the gate also shared that flight 5085 was delayed. Valentines Day weekend had everyone it seems feeling love in the air! “You should be fine to make your connecting flight as there are several delays in the system,” the flight check-in desk said. As the time ticked by and the window to catch our connecting flight from Charlotte to Las Vegas shrank, we asked again. Explaining to the attendant how very important it was for us to make this flight. “You’re not going to make that connector flight,” the gate agent said. “But not to worry, there are two flights behind that one going to Las Vegas and with these delays in the system, you're a “shoe in” to get one the next one. Just like happened here, others will miss their flights and seats will be open,” she said. “You are the first three on the standby list,” she said. “You’ll be fine.” We were not fine. We arrived at Charlotte at 3 p.m. and got to Gate C11 at 3:07 p.m. Our original flight to Las Vegas was scheduled to leave at 2:57 p.m. and when we got to the board at that gate, the board said the flight had left at 3:05 p.m. At that time I thought to myself, I wonder why they didn’t offer to hold the plane? Did they call the gate attendant here alerting them that three very excited passengers were delayed (at no fault of their own) and can make that flight if you hold it. Two minutes, And a small gesture of customer care. We, however, were not dismayed too much at this point as the agent had told us, “You’re a shoe-in for the next flight to Las Vegas. You’re the first three on the list.” The first flight came and went and we were not included. However, we heard the gate agent explain that they had oversold/overbooked the flight and asked if anyone were willing to give up their seat for a $600 voucher. There were 13 people on the standby list and we were numbers 1, 2, and 3. We waited for the second flight (having to go to a second gate) and again, we were the first on the list of about 17 on the standby list. Again, American had overbooked/oversold this flight as well (wonder what the purpose is of overselling every flight?) and asked if anyone were willing to give up their seat. In the end, they allowed standby passenger number 14 to board the flight despite the fact that we were a “shoe-in” at numbers 1,2, and 3. At that point there are no more flights available. And they actually asked us if we wanted to be on standby for the flight in the morning. I asked, “you mean the flight that you oversell, overbook?” “Spend the night in the airport?” No thank you, Having to make the call to my son was one of the most difficult things that I have had to do. Your actions as a company have had such a negative ripple effect across so many people all for the reason of getting as much money you can for every flight—overselling, misleading people telling them that there are delays all over the systems and you are a shoe-in. Unfortunately the story doesn’t end there. We went down to baggage claim. Miss Brittany Lloyd told us that one of our bags was on the plane to Las Vegas but the other two were here and it would be a minimum of 45 minutes to locate them and get them to baggage claim. We waited. We shared our situation with her. She blamed the ticket handlers and was not the lease bit concerned about our dilemma. (Mind you the sign above the door reads, “Customer Assistance Baggage”. There was no assistance. We requested to file a lost baggage claim. Ms. Lloyd said we have to call a number, “We don’t do that.” So my daughter called and stayed on hold for 25 minutes before being told that the employees at the “Customer Assistance Baggage” department need to do the baggage claim. She actually was able to get assistance from a young gentlemen working which I believe only happened because Ms. Lloyd wasn’t in the area. We waited 2 and half hours with no help or updates from the “Customer Assistance Baggage” staff. We asked Ms. Lloyd at the 2.5 hour mark how is it that she is able to determine where the bags are? Is that system reliable because is appears our bags are not here. She said that she is able to scan the the bag information. Then she blamed the system for not telling her the right thing. At no time during the 2.5 hours did Ms. Lloyd make any effort to check the status of our luggage until we had to go back and ask. She then informed us that all three of our bags were in Las Vegas. We asked to make a lost baggage claim and she told us we had to call. When we informed her that her corporate office instructed us that she, her department was responsible, she laughed and said, “They don’t know what they are doing. We can’t do that here, it’s their job.” I was left wondering what exactly is Ms. Lloyd paid to do? When we told her that her associate had filed the first claim she conceded to “update” the claim to add the other bags. I suppose that was easier work than to do a claim from scratch. I don’t know if you’ve ever experienced a simultaneous convergence of anger and sadness but it’s not exactly the emotion one would want to elicit in their customer. I have never had such a debasing, incompetent, dishonest, and completely unprofessional experience with a company. This is was a second chance for your company to prove what your public relations company claims about American Airlines. The last time we flew with your company, they cancelled our flight from Charlotte to Asheville and told us, “There is nothing we can do, you’re on your own.” We were hoping you would redeem your reputation that your employees and your policies built. Your systems are broken, your customer service training is nonexistent and your policies are driving your brand—I don’t believe it’s the direction you intended.","{'neg': 0.074, 'neu': 0.822, 'pos': 0.104, 'compound': 0.9922}",0.9922
0.9923,2021-08-01,2021-08-01,10.0,First Class my A** : American Airlines no longer cares about customers,"Unbelievable that an American Airlines MOST loyal customer, an Airpass Member and Executive Platinum Member and AA customer for more than 40 years, is forced to say AA is a disgrace! American Airlines has lost their way. And if I hear someone say “its due to COVID” one more time I might throw up. NO EXCUSESAfter a surgery required me to need a wheelchair to get on board my recent flight, I was amazed that there was NO pre boarding for anyone. In fact the gate agent called groups 1-4 at once. All the ground crew cared about was getting everyone on the plane so it wasn’t late departing. Thank God I was in First Class so I didn’t have to get further back in the plane amid the line of passengers with my crutches and baggage. Even once on board the new 737-800, I was amazed that the First Class seats have so little room, no padded arm rest any more, very little recline and such hard seats that my back was killing me after the 3 hour flight (shorter than most I have to take). I am 5’10”, 155 lbs and even I didn’t have much room. And what happened to the preflight drink? COVID, yeah right, because as we all know a drink of water OR alcohol before flying increases your chances of catching the nasty illness. Then when I tried to log on to AA Inflight the system was down and stayed down for the entire flight! Ridiculous! First Class meal: a disgusting choice of dry sandwich or a pimento cheese sandwich. Really? On an international flight? First Class prices and a hard seat with no head room, no leg room, no recline and lucky me (because I get food at all) a sandwich that even the staff said they wouldn’t eat. BTW, the one plus on this flight was the crew. They were great. This has not been the norm on many recent flights I have taken but this crew was excellent. And upon landing and trying to retrieve my luggage, I faced an issue that has been ongoing for years now. Priority tagged luggage is supposed to be first off the plane. Clearly NO ONE has any training on this anywhere in the world. Why am I paying Extremely High Prices to travel First Class? I dont know. I am definitely not getting my moneys worth.Between problems with AAs new “enhanced account management platform” that isn’t setup for use on phones and tablets (that’s right, upgrading technology so it no longer works on the most widely used platform in the world), not being able to make online reservations as an Airpass member, not being able to see the cost of flights I reserve until AFTER my flight when I get my statement, and ZERO response to requests for help, I am amazed at how they treat the most loyal customers. I was recently stranded half way through a trip when the “ enhanced account management platform” erased me from Americans system. Before that I was stranded in Eastern Europe with my wife and kids because of flight cancelations and the fact that Airpass offices were only open weekday Central Standard time. REALLY!!! I must be missing something because I get emails from AA all the time telling me how much they appreciate my loyalty.

Let me start with positive.  Because all airlines are basically being forced to drop exorbitant fees to entice clients,  I was able to make a change to a flight with no hassle.  Almost felt like the good old days of travel when the airlines didn't act like used car salesman.  The bad...We have never been treated so much like a disease as we were during our trip this December.  The flight attendants all the way to the captain of the plane made us feel like it was our privilege for them to fly us.  As the one paying their salaries and in this case around $5,000 for our tickets,  it should be the other way around.  I know everyone is scared to death right now, but if the planes and filtering systems are as safe as you say they are,  please stop stuffing the idea that masks will help down our throats.  We wore our masks, we boarded in the order requested,  we cleaned our chairs prior to sitting down.  Then we received a zip lock baggie with water and goldfish in out first class seats. We were then told to take our masks off to take a bite or sip, then put them back on in between.  Seriously?   I also would have been satisfied with a soda but apparently its only safe to serve alcoholic drinks because that is all they serve.  Just a heads up to all of you health Consultants at Delta,  I've known more people that have died from alcoholism in my life than Covid 19.  I don't have a problem with adults' consuming the beverage of their choice.  Just don't try to tell me you care about my health, then  contradict yourselves.  Also,  please ask your flight attendants to act like they care.  There are obviously some great ones,  but the percentages are going down.  Most seem to act on the defensive now.  PLEASE,  work on making it a pleasure to fly again.  I and all my employees have to fly in order to conduct business.

I am most often the only person on the plane who has paid the $125 one-way because I am not claiming that my dog is an emotional support animal. Now, please let me be frank here. There is a difference between someone who is obviously using a service animal due to a physical or emotional handicap....and then there is everyone else.  I know that Delta believes that they have made it difficult to take a pet for free, but that is NOT what people say who do this. I have asked them. They state that that documentation is easily found online, one just needs to pay for it, and that in the long run, it saves them money. So, I fly with my dog under the seat for $250 round trip and they fly with theirs on their lap for free! How is this fair? I ask, can my dog earn 1/2 miles? No. Can I get an extra piece of luggage free? No. Can I use my companion pass for him? No. Your policy encourages lying while offering nothing to those of us who are honest. Even just offering free wifi would be something, but Delta offers nothing for the few-and-far-between who are honest customers. Secondly, on a separate note, Delta should offer some type of reduced-luggage fees if one is flying to Africa with two extra suitcases of school supplies, as I am on Dec. 21. To pay $400 to deliver supplies to a struggling school seems like a decision that needs to be evaluated. Finally, as a soon-to-be Silver Medallion Member, your benefit of a free piece of luggage is not a benefit to those of us with Delta AmEx cards as we already have one piece free....you should allow SM members to have an additional free bag. In closing, the biggest issue is the one involving traveling with my dog. That one puts me in a slow burn me every time.","{'neg': 0.058, 'neu': 0.767, 'pos': 0.175, 'compound': 0.9928}",0.9928

The Captain kept everyone well informed and the flight attendants were attentive and responsive.  Restaurant quality meals.  We will definitely begin flying with Delta more in the future.We were late arriving in Amsterdam and missed our KLM connecting flight.  Went through the tedious Passport Check into the EU zone from our International zone but once at the Immigration Control Point, everything was very professional and expedient.  The KLM Club was spacious, clean and well stocked.  At check in, the Concierge already had us booked on the next available flight in the same class and same seats as on our original booking.  Every detail was handled seamlessly.  We had a flight attendant on our AMS - BUD that was on her last flight with KLM (moving on to another career).  Everyone on the plane helped celebrate her tenure and that made the flight quite personable and a great deal of fun.

0.9932,2021-08-01,2021-08-01,10.0,Just don’t.,"I am starting this review with the classic “ If I could leave less than a star I would” This is a long one… but worth the read; so stick around if you have time. Let me fill you in on some context before I describe how truly awful of an experience my husband and I had on our trip to Scotland to get married (yes, you read that right. This horrible experience happened on our trip to another country to get married) our wedding was planned for August 24th 2021. Originally, we had planned to get married in 2020 but had to postpone due to covid. So anyways, the long awaited wedding. Luckily, it was jus the 2 of us traveling to marry so no friends or family were involved. Our original flight plan was to depart 8/20 from TPA with an arrival date into INV on 8/21. (TPA-CLT-LHR-INV)Announcements were made that onboarding was beginning at TPA so we made our way over, some time had passed and we noticed that nobody was getting on the plane. Then we heard the announcement “Flight #2915 to Charlotte will be delayed due to mechanical reasons” then some more time passed and they decided to let us board. Once everyone boarded they made another announcement that there would be additional delays due to inclement weather. My husband and I were checking the weather radar at this time and saw no sign of inclement weather, just the beautiful sun shining skies of Florida. At this point most people on the plane were getting upset because of the upcoming missed connections that were going to take place once arriving to CLT. We spoke with one of the attendants on the plane an explained our situation and asked what the arrival time would be he told us it has been pushed back from 3:30 to 5:30. Which of course is going to cause us to miss our connecting flight to London. He advised us that it would make the most sense to stay on this flight to get to CLT because they are a bigger hub and would have better luck getting us on a sooner flight to London than staying at TPA. So we finally land in LHR at 5:30. My husband and I rushed to the gate to try to make our original flight to LHR which was scheduled to depart at 5:45 but once we got there it had departed. Mind you, this was our first time traveling internationally and our first trip with American Airlines. When speaking with “customer service” (and yes, I am putting that in quotations because it should hardly be considered customer service) the associate re-booked us to a flight leaving to LHR the following evening. At this point we had lost an entire day of preparation before our wedding. The associate also offered us a coupon for a nights stay at Comfort Inn and told us that there would be a shuttle waiting in front of the hotel. She also made us aware that since our flight was now delayed by a day that we would need to retake our Covid Tests. But not to worry, she gave us a location that offered a rapid PCR test costing $190 per each test for a total of $380. After leaving the “customer service” counter we then stopped by baggage claim to insure they were aware that our original flight was missed and they assured us that our checked bags were being held and had been directed to our new flight leaving August 21. We then proceeded to the area we were directed to wait for our shuttle to Comfort Inn. We waited for an hour and a shuttle for Comfort Inn never showed up. However, several shuttles for other accommodations did. Obviously, at this point we decided to board the next shuttle that showed up which was to Fairfield Inn & Suites.Mind you, we also contacted your “customer service” telephone line to be sure there wasn't any other flights that could be taken so that we were behind schedule an entire day. The rep insisted that there wasn’t. Not even with any other airlines. At this point our frustration with the lack of care or effort that we received throughout our trip so far was growing. We asked the representative on the phone to speak with a supervisor that could potentially be of more help. She told us there was not anyone else to speak to and that American Airlines does not have a customer support team. She also told us that in order to file a complaint the only way to do so was by email and that we were not able to officially file the complaint until our trip was completed in case any other issues were to arise. I wish that this was the end of the complaint but unfortunately many other issues ended up arising and this was only the beginning of a nightmare trip that should have been everything but. The following day we made sure to get to the CLT early so that we could check with baggage claim again to make sure both of our checked bags were being directed to our new flight to LHR, they assured us they were holding them and they were in track to be put on our new flight. When it became time to board our flight from CLT to LHR we checked again with the onboarding desk at the gate because our app was showing only 1 checked bag was in route to be loaded onto our plane. She also assured us that if 1 was showing then the other was loaded as well. We checked the app again after getting seated on the plane. It was still showing the same thing, 1 bag loaded and the other still in CLT. We were planning to check with a flight attendant to explain the situation and see if they could offer any type of insight but instead the first attendant that came around was unbelievably rude and hateful. Before we even had the chance to speak with him he looked in the overhead storage and proclaimed ”who’s bag is this?” In which my husband replied “mine” and the attendant said “you should do something with it because if I have to touch it, it’s going under the plane with the checked bags”  To be talked to like that after everything else that we had just went though truly was enough for us to decide to NEVER use American Airlines after this trip again. I am not sure where this man received his training from but I can assure you if it were my company I would not keep him employed. What a poor excuse he is for a flight attendant. Horribly rude and no manners whatsoever. Needless to say my husband was furious and decided to ask one of the other flight attendants, Pattie, if there was anyone he could speak to about this interaction. She sent over her “supervisor”, Keith. Keith came by to ask what the issue was and preceded to tell my husband that he would prefer the short story of the situation that transpired.  So we started the short version of our story and Keith equated everything we had endured so far to being a “rough day.”  Keith and Pattie would not give us the name of the attendant and instead told us to tell you that it was the male flight attendant on the back of the plane. We also asked for a bottle of water on this flight and the attendant told us they didn’t have any bottles of water for purchase. Which is shocking for how long the duration of that trip was. We also paid for preferred seats on this flight.  So, as you can imagine at this point we just gave up with any hopes that anyone on this plane had any respect or empathy for their passengers.Once again I wish I could say this was the end of the awful experience we had but as I’m sure you can guess at this point it is not. After finally landing in LHR and going through customs we went directly to the American Airlines service desk to have them track our bags and he too assured us that both of our bags were now on track to be delivered to INV and was unsure as to of why our app wasn't updated.Now, we finally were on board to our final destination- Inverness, Scotland. As I’m sure you have guessed by now, once we landed in INV 1 of our bags did not. We honestly weren’t surprised based on the turn of events that we had already experienced. We were just exhausted and emotionally drained from the entire experience. So now, we have to deal with a lost bag on top of our wedding in 2 days. We were lucky enough to meet a true customer service rep with British Airways, the first person throughout this experience that actually seemed to care. This rep not only filled out the appropriate paperwork but also immediately called the airports we had flown through explaining that our wedding was in 2 days and how important it was to find and receive our luggage in a timely manner. He was able to locate the missing luggage and even arranged for a courier to deliver it since our place of stay was located 3.5 hours from the airport. Thank you, Ian!This review has taken some time for us to write because we wanted to celebrate our marriage and not focus on the negativity of the trip. We have been in contact with American Airlines customer relations rep, Cesar, and he has advised us the only thing that they can do is reimburse us for the hotels stay at Fairfield Inn & Suites and offer us a $200 flight credit. This credit really has no value to us as we have mentioned several times we will never be traveling with American Airlines again. It would have been nice to be reimbursed for the additional cost of covid testing we had to pay out of pocket for since this was something we had already done in preparation for our original flight. Unfortunately, Cesar said this was not possible. So we assured him we would be leaving a review for American Airlines that truly showed our experience. Now a couple months have passed and we are doing that.I also want to be clear that my husband and I have both worked in the customer service industry for a majority of our working lives and know that this was not handled in a professional or courteous manner. We firsthand understand the stress that is placed on everyone in service industry fields due to the ongoing covid pandemic. Unfortunately, the way this issue was handled from all aspects was a total miss and disappointment on American Airlines part. We hope this review will have you look at other options when deciding on who you will travel with next.","{'neg': 0.072, 'neu': 0.834, 'pos': 0.094, 'compound': 0.9932}",0.9932

0.9938,2021-03-01,2021-03-01,20.0,"Disappointing seats, but otherwise fine","American Airlines Flight 2918MIA-SFO9:25 am-12:54 pm Airbus A321S My wife and I recently took a morning flight from Miami to San Francisco, and although the flight itself was objectively fine, we were very disappointed with our seats. Since we saw that the flight looked very full, we purchased Main Cabin Extra seats to have extra legroom for the 6.5-hour flight. However, we don’t believe the seats we paid for actually had any extra legroom, which led to a cramped and frustrating experience.Miami Airport was very busy on the morning that we departed, and we were surprised at how vast the AA check-in area is at that airport. There are a lot of different check-in lines and banks of self-service kiosks for American Airlines flights at MIA, so if you enter where the line is particularly long, I would keep walking to look for another area that’s less busy. By walking a bit further down past the first few doors into the building where everyone seems to get dropped off, we were able to find empty kiosks to check and tag our luggage without a wait. After doing the self-tagging, we just had to wait a minute or two to drop it off at the bag drop area.Security was also quite busy that morning, and even though we were able to use the PreCheck line, the line was pretty long, spilling out into the ticketing area. The wait wasn’t as long as it appeared, and we made it through security and to our gate at the far end of the terminal (D48) using the Skytrain with about 10 minutes before boarding, after having arrived at the airport about 80 minutes before the flight. As we knew, the flight to San Francisco was completely full, and boarding began a couple minutes early. I didn’t like that boarding wasn’t done in the most organized fashion. Boarding always seems to proceed best when the gate agents call one group at a time and don’t call the next group until the previous one has fully boarded, especially during the pandemic when there is supposed to be a goal of social distancing. However, the gate agents started calling the boarding groups in pretty rapid succession, which led to lots of crowding and confusion at the gate. When we were on the plane settled into our seats, I was immediately struck at how tight the space seemed to be, considering that we had paid $99 per person to upgrade to Main Cabin Extra seats that were marked as being in the exit row with extra legroom. This was Row 12 on the legacy American A321S, which is a row of three seats, where the aisle and middle seat have another seat directly in front, but the window seat has no seat in front of it, allowing for access to the exit door and tons of legroom. We were in the less desirable aisle and middle seats, which simply did not feel like they had extra space at all as compared to when we sit in standard economy. We looked over at a non-exit row Main Cabin Extra row across from us, and it was obvious that row had significantly more legroom than our seats. I’m pretty positive that our seats just had standard legroom, but were sold as Main Cabin Extra because they were technically in the exit row along with the spacious window seat. Cramped legroom aside, it was nice that our seats had a variety of amenities, including seatback TVs and outlets for charging devices. Wifi was also available on the flight, with several items offered for free, including a variety of movies, tv shows, and Apple Music to stream, all in addition to what was loaded on the seatback TVs.  We’re much more used to the legacy-US Airways A321 that is bare bones, so it is always nice to be on one of the legacy-AA ones that are better equipped.Boarding was also a bit of a mess, since the aircraft ran out of overhead bin space after many passengers had already boarded with their carry-ons. This led to major bottlenecks in the aisles, as well as some really rude passengers screaming at the flight attendants about it and just being generally rude and hard to deal with. I felt bad for the crew, who I thought handled it as well as they could. Once carry-ons were figured out and everyone was finally seated, we left about 10 minutes late, but took off quickly.Shortly into the flight, the flight attendants came around to provide drink service and Biscoff cookies. This was the first flight we’ve been on during the pandemic that included a more normal drink service and choice of beverages in economy (the only things not offered were alcoholic beverages). I believe I read that American’s return to a more normal drink service is only on longer flights like this one thus far. I did think it would have been nice if more drinks or snacks were offered later in the flight, since it was a long one. Even just coming around to offer extra cookies or water as an additional beverage would have been appreciated, but the only service was at the very start of the flight.After a generally uneventful, but not so comfortable flight, we arrived at the gate in San Francisco about 20 minutes early. This was our first time arriving at SFO on an American flight in a while, and we were very impressed by the new Harvey Milk Terminal that AA flights now operate out of. The terminal itself was beautiful, with lots of space and a surprisingly restful feel for an airport. We made our way to baggage claim and were very impressed to see how the new baggage carousels were designed, with bags coming out at multiple spots of the large carousel. Because of this, there’s no one “desirable” spot to stand in to be the first to get your bag, since you don’t know exactly where yours will come out. Checked bags came out quickly and we were on our way.Still frustrated about the seats we had paid for on this flight, I wrote to American the next day to complain about the seats we had paid for. I first reached out to them via DM on Twitter, which I know can help with certain customer service situations, but it wasn’t helpful this time. The responses I got were rude, and basically just said that because we sat in the seats we paid for, they wouldn’t provide any refund or compensation. They were totally missing my point that although we did sit in the seats we paid for, the seats themselves didn’t seem to have the main attribute of Main Cabin Extra, extra legroom. I then reached out to the airline via the contact section of the website, and I got a much better email response that way. I explained that I felt that the seats were mismarked as Main Cabin Extra based on their legroom, and I received an apologetic response saying that we were eligible for a refund of the seat fees if we submitted it on the refund section of the website. I submitted for our refunds and received them a few days later. It was a little unclear if the person responding to my request really understood the issue or if they’d look into it for the future (doubtful), but I was glad to get the refund we were hoping for. I actually would have preferred just having extra legroom on the flight, but getting a refund was a fine outcome after the fact.Overall, this flight from Miami to San Francisco was fine, given that we arrived early and the flight was smooth and uneventful. However, the poor space in the Main Cabin Extra seats we had paid for will make us much more careful when choosing seats in the future. Even if our seats did have extra space relative to standard economy (which I don’t think they did), it was truly so minimal that I would never have voluntarily paid extra for it.","{'neg': 0.048, 'neu': 0.87, 'pos': 0.082, 'compound': 0.9938}",0.9938

I was so happy when they started service to the Hawaiian islands.  With no first class or meals, I was uncertain how such a long flight would be; however, as they’ve done for the past 50 years, Southwest delivers the same high level consistent service we’ve all come to expect.  Regardless of the craziness covid has brought to air travel, the crew was nothing short of perfect.  I have no ties to Southwest Airlines other than my brand loyalty to a company that understands that  their employees are their competitive advantage.  There was no “harshness” towards the passengers they had to remind how to properly wear their masks, rather just polite conversation to make sure everybody was in compliance.  The new 737 - Max 8 felt roomy and bright.  The cabin was very quiet and comfortable. They did serve a larger snack that did help tie us over until reaching our destination. Southwest is not a “budget” airlines, to me they are a no frills airline that gives you everything necessary to get from point “A” to point “B” (including free checked bags) safely, comfortably and  at a reasonable price point. Their staff is always friendly, courteous and often times funny.The entertainment system is good, easy to use with a good selection.

I loved the free bags and no extra fees. I always had great customer service too. I used to recommend Southwest to everyone. Well let me tell you, no more! Their service, quality, and customer care has gone down the drain! I finally got to visit my family this summer after a year and a half of not seeing most of them due to the pandemic. Myself and my three boys traveled to our destination via American Airlines. Had no issues there - great service and a nice plane! On the way back, however, I traveled via Southwest. Unbeknownst to me they had changed my nonstop flight to a flight with one stop in Orlando. I found this out when checking on my flight a few days before. Now in their defense, I searched my email and they had notified me of this change back in the beginning of May via an email that I am fairly certain ended up in my promotions folder instead of my inbox or else I would have seen it. The thing that urked me is that they made this change the day after I bought my 3 nonstop tickets. The day after their sale ended, they decided to get rid of a bunch of nonstop flights. How convenient for them... Not so much all of us who booked with them because we wanted a nonstop flight. I was hoping they had one this week that I could change it to, but nope. Checked their website - none. Now mind you, I was traveling alone with three boys. My oldest is 6 and the other two are both under the age of 2 (a 21 month old and a 6 month old). If you are a parent, you understand how difficult this could be. I waited on hold for almost 2 hours just for them to tell me they could refund my tickets, but if I used flight credit it would stay as flight credit (not helpful as they have no nonstop flights on this route anymore). They said they ""temporarily"" got rid of nonstop flights from their schedule. I looked at my options for the week and either the layovers were way too short to make it to the other plane for us or they were long and required even more flight time. Needless to say, I had to keep my flight. By then other airlines were too expensive and Southwest said they could not book us on another airline. I was told this before I even asked so you know a bunch of people must have asked this. I haven't gotten to the worst part yet.. We had a fine first flight to Orlando. A little over two hours. They kept changing the time but ended up boarding on time after all. We made it to Orlando and our stroller was already waiting for us when we got off the plane. Kudos to Orlando people. Flying to Dallas was a different story. We were sitting in the plane an hour before we took off. This was due to the weather, so that, I understand. This was another 2 and a half hour flight as well. My poor kids were doing fairly well despite traveling all day. (Remember, two of them are a young toddler and a baby.) Near the end of the flight while we had been traveling for over 11 hours already one of the flight attendants remarks about the mess we had made (my toddler spilled some chip crumbs on the floor) and said that we would have to clean it up, but she said it in a passive aggressive way and asked if we needed a trash bag. While I told her ""okay"" I don't think she heard me because she said, ""I will get you a trash bag,"" like it was a mission of hers. She never ended up bringing the trash bag. Now mind you, I have a baby on my lap that is still learning how to sit up well on his own and a young toddler that I am trying to keep entertained so he stays in his seat and my 6 yr old is napping. But she expects me to bend down in the tiny space where our legs go while holding a baby to pick up crumbs. Really? When my 6 year old woke up I made sure he helped me and we quickly threw away all of our trash including stuff on the floor as the attendants went by quickly with the trash bags. (Side rant: Why do they always go by so fast even when they see you still trying to gather trash?) Needless to say, we left some chip crumbs on the floor and some fell in between the seats (which already were dirty with other people's crumbs so I wasn't reaching in there). When we got off of the plane I was waiting with the boys for my stroller with the baby attached to me in a wrap. There was one other family with their daughter waiting too by the time I got my stroller. As I am unfolding my double stroller with the baby attached to me and making sure my toddler doesn't run off, the flight attendant who never brought me the trash bag comes off of the plane and said that I left a huge mess and it was rude of me because they have nothing to clean it up with and as I was saying, ""You never brought me a trash bag,"" (which was the only reponse my flabbergasted mind could come up with), she just kept walking and ignored me. WOW.. The mom in the other family waiting for a stroller was like, ""Really?!"" She couldn't believe how rude that flight attendant was to me while she sees me struggling to juggle my kids and our stuff and stroller while traveling all day by myself (my husband had to stay in TX and work). I am generally a nice person okay, and if she had brought me a trash bag like she said she was, even though she was rude, I would have had my 6 yr old son help me clean up the floor hoping I didn't squish the baby while bending over in that small space with him and doing her job for her. Is it my fault Southwest makes flight attendants clean the plane? Isn't that part of your job? Is it my fault they don't give you guys hand vacuums? So besides the super rude, unsympathetic flight attendant who must have never been a mother, and Southwest getting rid of all of their nonstop flights from Philly to Dallas (and who knows where else), Southwest does not do the amount of COVID cleaning they claim they do. Both planes were dirty and the first one I was on had dirty tray tables that I made sure and wiped off and sanitized for all of us. Southwest is skimping on their cleaning procedures because they are turning over planes at such a quick rate. They just care about the all-mighty dollar. They don't seem to care about their customers anymore. It is a real shame. Southwest, I used to love you, I used to always fly you, but now I must say goodbye. Try to do better, please.","{'neg': 0.066, 'neu': 0.828, 'pos': 0.106, 'compound': 0.9942}",0.9942

My husband says to the flight attendant, ""he probably can't hear you because he has his headphones on"" and the flight attendant says, ""well, if he wants to look like an idiot in front of everyone, that's his choice"".  1) It's unacceptable to call anyone an idiot, especially a supposed customer.  2) I'm guessing this flight attendant is the real idiot because he assumed we were not traveling with this man with his headphones on, not realizing that he's our son.  If I think that the flight attendant is willing to call another customer ""an idiot"" to a customer, what does he call me to other passengers when I'm not listening.

0.9944,2021-11-08,2021-11-08,6.0,"""further upgrades are needed"""," |  I arrived and departed from Terminal 1 and if you've travelled a lot around the world, you know this is not the worst terminal in the world, but it's far from being the finest either. Poorly designed from the outset, I have seen improvements made and they are more than welcome, but further upgrades are needed. Here's my experience with a few recommendations for improvement (hope management is reading!). Arriving in the baggage hall, there is no big screen indicating which carrousels are for which flights. You have to walk around and eventually you find it. Confusing to say the least. Having said that, luggage arrived fast, and immigration was relatively quick and pain-free. Agent was not unfriendly. Washrooms in arrivals area clean and modern. The UP train to Toronto Union station is excellent: comfortable, fast and not expensive. Upon departure, check-in and security were efficient and fast. The security area is a vast improvement from when the terminal was first built, and the walk to the international gate area seems much more spacious and attractive. There is fast and free WIFI. The international gate area (E gates) is another story - much too narrow a space and totally unfit for purpose, still crowded with strange tables and stools with Ipads (fine for eating but inadequate when waiting for flights with hand luggage) and a total lack of seating despite this flight being a smaller plane and not even full. No relaxing seating of the kind you find in multiple international airports around the world anywhere (not that there would be any space to put them). People were sitting on the ground and queues for flights snaked over into adjoining gate areas. Bathrooms near the gate are small and gross - it felt like something taken out of a high-school circa 1980. If there is one thing to say about this terminal it's inconsistency, with gate area spaciousness, seating (kind and amount) and queuing for flights being especially poor for a terminal of it's size. Needs a re-think if international hub status is every to be achieved.","{'neg': 0.056, 'neu': 0.767, 'pos': 0.177, 'compound': 0.9944}",0.9944
0.9945,2022-02-02,2022-02-02,7.0,"""a nice airport with lots of amenities"""," |  Newark Airport is underrated - if you know what you're doing. To most travelers, EWR is a very confusing airport with lots of (not so great connections) around the airport. However, once you get the hang of things, EWR is a nice airport with lots of amenities. Getting there, parking is very open most of the time, and most of the time you have to either book 24hrs in advance or go to Short Term parking. They accept multiple forms of payment such as EZ-Pass and credit cards (Terminal C accepts Cash). Getting there on train is also convenient from the city as NJTransit operates to Newark every 15-30 minutes from NY Penn Station. The AirTrain could be down occasionally, so make sure you have time to get to the terminal before your flight. About terminals, Terminal C and B have adequate facilities and places to shop. Terminal A however, is being torn down to make way for Terminal 1 in the future. Terminal A is one of the most dated terminals there is, and I would only recommend flying out of it unless you HAVE to (i.e JetBlue, United Express, Air Canada etc.). Security can be very slow at times at Terminal A (especially during busy hours). Terminal B is the international terminal. This terminal is somewhat dated, however, is way better than Terminal A. Customs are relatively quick here, never had an issue getting through. The last terminal (and where most of EWR's travelers go through) is Terminal C. Terminal C is the best terminal at current hands down. United has modernized this terminal to fit the needs of the modern traveler. The TSA process can be from what I experienced to be anywhere from 5-20 minutes, which isn't that bad. Be warned though, prices do get steep here in terms of retail options and dining options. There is very little cheap food options (besides the Wendy's and Dunkin Donuts, or the Starbucks pre-security), so if you want a good meal, be prepared to shell out some extra cash. Getting to any gate at Terminal C is relatively easy, as if you don't need to walk, there's buggies driving around taxing people through crowds to get to gates. (don't forget to tip them!). So in short from this review, if you're going in Newark, if the trip is a couple bucks extra going out of Newark on United in Terminal C, do it. Terminal C will be your greatest for connections, as well as overall amenities.","{'neg': 0.014, 'neu': 0.844, 'pos': 0.142, 'compound': 0.9945}",0.9945
0.9949,2020-06-01,2020-06-01,30.0,What happened to the COVID-19 safety practices?,"I recently took my first “non-essential “ travel to Florida to response to a family medical emergency. After great consideration and the reports of others who had flown recently, I decided to take the risk of flying with proper PPE and the stated safety accommodations the airlines were publishing.  I was surprised at the casual massing of flying customers at the gate. Some wore masks, others didn’t. I’d read that careful boarding (back to front) helped avoid unnecessary jamming of the aisles and reduced multiple passes be other passengers.  To my continued surprise, the same group boarding group cattle-call was in effect, with a long line in the boarding line, ramp and in the aircraft. At least everyone was wearing a mask ( of sorts... bandannas, tee shirts pulled up, etc). My next surprise was the announcement that this was a “full flight.”  I assumed this meant that, with staggered seated for social distance, the flight was a capacity.  I was more and more concerned as the seats filled in. I guessed families flying together would sit together until my row filled in too. As I strapped my mask tighter, I sat shoulder to shoulder on 3 of the four legs of my 6 hour journey from San Diego to Orlando ( change of planes at DFW).Flight crew instructed that masks “should” remain on throughout the flight, but could be removed during eating and drinking ( American offered a small courtesy bag with a half-bottle of water and a small pack of cookies)... no food or beverage services throughout the rest of the flights. I noticed many folks without masks during the flight- not apparently eating or drinking and the passenger in my row fell asleep with his mask halfway off.  Flight attendants have a hard job and COVID-19 must make it that muck riskier. However, I didn’t see any attempts to ask passengers to keep masks on or clear the packed aisles when boarding and deplaning. I asked about the full flights and was casually told they had to aggregate flights to assure they could fly economically and some flight will either get canceled or other would sometimes be completely full.  I am pretty brave about taking estimated risks, as a medical professional, but I will try my best to protect myself and those around me. It felt like American had chosen economics over reasonable safety precautions.  I know people are of vastly different opinions about how to or whether they even need to wear masks and other PPE, but medical science and the CDC are pretty consistent about what reduces risk and what increases it.  I felt I was taking an informed risk based on advertised safety precautions.  I don’t recall the Airlines announcing an easing of their concerns.  You’d expect the flight crews to be concerned and at least push for distancing and tight cover regulations.  Good luck to us all.  I finished my self quarantine after flying and am symptom free this time!","{'neg': 0.039, 'neu': 0.823, 'pos': 0.138, 'compound': 0.9949}",0.9949
0.995,2020-06-01,2020-06-01,50.0,Efficient and Friendly Customer Service During Covid-19,"I have flown with Delta airlines and Northwest prior to the merger for many years both domestically and internationally.  I can honestly say that through the years they have been there when my travel plans have been altered due to family and travel emergencies.  Most recently, with the Covid Pandemic, I had to cancel a trip with friends to Egypt. Of all the contacts involved with my altered trip plans, Delta Airlines was the most efficient, effective and friendly.  My initial (and only necessary) contact was greeted by an actual person who not only solved my flight issues but gave me options.  I requested a refund as compared to a flight credit due to my unemployment status.  This was posted to my credit card account in less than 1 week, which was weeks ahead of the reported timeframe, which was a great relief and assistance to my ability to meet financial responsibilities.  I feel like many companies are hiding behind the facade of the pandemic to excuse themselves from providing quality customer service.  It is apparent that there are some companies, such as Delta Airlines, that truly took the necessary steps to provide what was necessary during these unforeseen times.  I also respect the fact that Delta is taking the necessary steps to provide a safe environment for current patrons that must fly as I did a few weeks ago.  I feel that Delta is truly taking safety seriously over profits, as demonstrated in part by not filling middle row seats on their planes as other airlines are doing.  I hope this company is rewarded in the future for taking the necessary and difficult steps during these challenging times.","{'neg': 0.047, 'neu': 0.736, 'pos': 0.218, 'compound': 0.995}",0.995
0.9951,2021-03-01,2021-03-01,40.0,Comfortable domestic flight on a wide-body aircraft,"American Airlines Flight 415PHL-MIA6:40-9:26 am Boeing 787-800 My wife and I recently took an early morning flight from Philadelphia to Miami on American, and thought it was a very good flight overall, particularly due to the aircraft. It was great to be on a 787 Dreamliner for the short flight to Miami, which provided great extra space in the premium economy section that was sold as Main Cabin Extra. The flight was departing from Gate A8 in Terminal A-East at PHL, but all ticketing and security in that terminal has been closed for most of the pandemic. There were signs outside to tell passengers to check-in at Terminal A-West (typically used more for international departures), which is what we did. I would currently recommend using Terminal A-West for all flights departing from any part of Terminal A at PHL.It was busy in the ticketing area, but there were a lot of employees around to direct us to open kiosks to self-tag our luggage. They also kept asking which flight we were on and directing us accordingly, so I’m not sure if the check-in area was somehow further divided up by flight that morning. The employee who weighed our bags and checked our IDs was particularly friendly and pleasant, which was a nice surprise at PHL and a very welcome start to our trip. The Terminal A-West security checkpoint isn’t the biggest, but it wasn’t particularly crowded that morning, with a separate PreCheck line that we were able to take advantage of. We were through security in only a couple minutes. From there, it was a quick walk to the gate. The flight to Miami was completely full, and boarding began a couple minutes early. We were very happy when we settled into our seats, which were located in what would normally be the premium economy section of the 787 on long-haul flights. These seats are essentially equivalent to first-class seats that AA features on smaller aircraft on most domestic flights. However, in this case, the premium economy seats were being sold as Main Cabin Extra seats as part of economy, rather than a separate upgraded class like they would be on an international flight. It cost us $25 per person to upgrade from standard economy to these seats, which are significantly better than all other seats in the economy cabin. Anytime we see that American is operating a wide-body aircraft on a domestic route, we look out for this great opportunity to upgrade to significantly better seats for a low cost. It was also nice that our seats had all the amenities we could need, including seatback TVs, multiple outlets, and footrests. Wifi was also available on the flight, with several items offered for free, including a variety of movies, tv shows, and Apple Music to stream, all in addition to what was loaded on the seatback TVs.This was actually my first time in a window seat on a Dreamliner, so I initially really liked the window controls, which allow you to choose how light or dim you want the view out the window to be, with no normal window shade. However, as the flight went on, I did not appreciate that the flight attendants took over the controls shortly after takeoff and locked all windows on the darkest setting, which prevents passengers from seeing out at all. I can understand putting the windows on this setting on a redeye where the cabin should remain dark, but this was a daytime flight. Not being able to see anything out the window for almost the entire flight was disappointing, and they only allowed us to control our own windows again a few minutes before we landed in Miami. Not having any ability to see out also made my wife a little dizzy at times. Shortly into the flight, the flight attendants came around to provide mini water bottles and pretzels. This has generally been the standard level of service on most shorter AA flights we’ve been on lately, except that the same items have been given out during boarding on most other flights. The crew was pretty hands-off throughout the flight, and we didn’t really see or interact with anyone much otherwise.The flight attendants did make several of the standard announcements about required mask wearing during the flight, and I didn’t see any non-compliance from passengers. However, I didn’t appreciate that when the captain made his own announcement about masks, there was a very clear negative tone to it, implying that he disagrees with the mask mandate. He was apologizing that passengers have to wear masks solely because of federal requirements, and said that he understands how hard wearing a mask is, so everyone should just try their best to get through the flight wearing a mask. First of all, with the flight being under 3 hours long, it’s hardly a major imposition to wear a mask. I thought it was also totally unprofessional that he added his opinion to the mask requirement, when it’s simply a federal requirement, regardless of how anyone feels about it personally. His announcement could also undermine the flight attendants’ ability to enforce the mandate, which isn’t fair to them either.After a very comfortable flight, we arrived at the gate in Miami just a couple minutes early. Unfortunately, the baggage claim process added a lot of frustration at the end of the trip. I find the baggage claim area at MIA to be too small in general, with too many flights arriving at the same time and all sharing carousels. That made it hard to tell which flight’s bags were coming out at any given time and made the area much too crowded. After multiple other flights that had arrived after ours received their bags, our bags finally showed up almost an hour after we had arrived at the gate. This was incredibly frustrating, and is one the slowest baggage claim experiences I’ve had on American or any other airline in quite some time. I’m not sure what took so long, but it made us late getting where we wanted to be in Miami, even though our flight had arrived as scheduled.Overall, this flight from PHL-MIA was nice, particularly given all the space we had in Main Cabin Extra seats in the premium economy section of the Dreamliner. Other than the inability to see out the windows during the flight and the overly long baggage claim process, we were happy with the experience.","{'neg': 0.061, 'neu': 0.836, 'pos': 0.103, 'compound': 0.9951}",0.9951

However, Southwest recently showed me just how much they appreciate my loyal business.I booked a flight late November of 2020.  Just before my trip in the month of November, I tested positive for COVID-19.  Due to quarantine, I was forced to cancel my trip.  I called Southwest and they gave me a credit for the flight.  I was told that I could not take the credit as points, which I was fine with.  Due to my positive test, and travel restrictions from my employer to certain states, I have not been able to travel, nor have I had any reason to travel.  My credit expires on July 7, 2021.  With restrictions being lifted, I decided to book flight for late July 2021, my wife and I celebrating our anniversary.  Southwest advised me that I could not use my $436 credit towards that flight because the flight was booked after the expiration of the credit.  I explained that I had no other trips to take and requested a two week extension of the credit for my anniversary trip.  Southwest refused to extend my credit a reasonable 2 weeks and told me to allow the credit to expire.  Then call them and request an extension after the expiration.  With this option they would take $100 from my credit, and then I wouldn’t be able to use the new credit of $336 until after 20 days later.  They would then extend the credit.  So I either lose $436 or get $336 that I can’t use for the trip I would need it for!!So I decided to take an unplanned trip in June, a trip I neither planned or budgeted for, just so that I would not lose my $436.  When I attempted to book a flight for June, Southwest would only allow me to use half of my credit for the 2 tickets I attempted to purchase.  Still leaving me approximately $218 that I will probably lose.  How can a company be so empathetic with circumstances surrounding a pandemic and then implement policies designed for a customer to lose money, especially when they are telling me that I have a credit.

0.9966,2021-10-01,2021-10-01,10.0,American Airlines v Delta Airlines ..  No Contest,"My Wife and I just completed a “Bucket List” 49th Anniversary Viking River Cruise Trip that was exceptional!  We were originally scheduled to fly British Airways to Budapest however that was changed to an American flight and then finally to a Delta flight. I was happy in that a number of Friends have told me how nice Delta is v. American. I have not flown Delta in a number of years opting for American because we were primarily flying out of AA Hubs in Philadelphia and Orlando. Boy were they right!  From Baggage Check in to Friendliness to Cleanliness and Flight Attendant Attitude, Delta wins hands down.  We were flying First Class so there was access to the Delta Club in both Orlando and Atlanta as well as the KLM Club in Amsterdam.  They were clean / airy, the Reception was extremely friendly, the choices of food and beverages was very good, windows clean and seating comfortable. Check In was a breeze and the cubical seating was clean and comfortable with lots of at seat storage space.  The seats were highly adjustable.  We were on an Airbus 380 series.  There was a mechanical issue with our flight from Atlanta to Amsterdam which caused a 1 ½ hour delay in departure.  Someone had flushed a toy on the previous flight that was stuck in a critical valve for offloading the toilet waste.  This was discovered after everyone was on board and the decision made to remain boarded rather than deplane.  The captain kept everyone informed of their progress in the remediation with factual information sprinkled with a little humor.  The flight attendants made everyone on the plane as comfortable as possible. When underway, the cabin service was great, the food upscale restaurant quality and the entertainment selections were current.  I cannot sleep on planes so I was able to notice the flight attendants were checking on everyone every 15 minutes.  They also attended to the toilets every 30 minutes.  The wake – up process was “gentle” and well executed.  The entertainment headsets were left at our seats on deplaning. The delay meant we had missed our connection in Amsterdam however, after passing through the Immigration Check, when we arrived at the KLM Club, they had our tickets waiting (same seats same class) for us on the next flight to Budapest departing in 1 ½ hours.  Turned out to be a FUN flight as one of the flight attendants was on her last flight with KLM and moving on to a new career.  Everyone was celebrating her the entire flight. Older model 737 but clean and comfortable.  Offboarding and baggage claim were easy in Budapest.Our return flight was on an American 780 series aircraft.

That attitude continued when our boarding passes were printed and had split up my Wife and I on a 10+ hour flight from Amsterdam to Dallas.  The reasoning given was the captain had rights to one of our seats.  I’ve flown numerous international business / first  flights and never had that happen.  The check in person was borderline rude stating that was the policy and we could change to the last row (next to a galley and restroom) or stay in the current separated seats.

0.9966,2021-10-01,2021-10-01,50.0,Delta v American  ..  No Contest,"My Wife and I just completed a “Bucket List” 49th Anniversary Viking River Cruise Trip that was exceptional!  We were originally scheduled to fly British Airways to Budapest however that was changed to an American flight and then finally to a Delta flight. I was happy in that a number of Friends have told me how nice Delta is v. American. I have not flown Delta in a number of years opting for American because we were primarily flying out of AA Hubs in Philadelphia and Orlando. Boy were they right!  From Baggage Check in to Friendliness to Cleanliness and Flight Attendant Attitude, Delta wins hands down.  We were flying First Class so there was access to the Delta Club in both Orlando and Atlanta as well as the KLM Club in Amsterdam.  They were clean / airy, the Reception was extremely friendly, the choices of food and beverages was very good, windows clean and seating comfortable. Check In was a breeze and the cubical seating was clean and comfortable with lots of at seat storage space.  The seats were highly adjustable.  We were on an Airbus 380 series.  There was a mechanical issue with our flight from Atlanta to Amsterdam which caused a 1 ½ hour delay in departure.  Someone had flushed a toy on the previous flight that was stuck in a critical valve for offloading the toilet waste.  This was discovered after everyone was on board and the decision made to remain boarded rather than deplane.  The captain kept everyone informed of their progress in the remediation with factual information sprinkled with a little humor.  The flight attendants made everyone on the plane as comfortable as possible. When underway, the cabin service was great, the food upscale restaurant quality and the entertainment selections were current.  I cannot sleep on planes so I was able to notice the flight attendants were checking on everyone every 15 minutes.  They also attended to the toilets every 30 minutes.  The wake – up process was “gentle” and well executed.  The entertainment headsets were left at our seats on deplaning. The delay meant we had missed our connection in Amsterdam however, after passing through the Immigration Check, when we arrived at the KLM Club, they had our tickets waiting (same seats same class) for us on the next flight to Budapest departing in 1 ½ hours.  Turned out to be a FUN flight as one of the flight attendants was on her last flight with KLM and moving on to a new career.  Everyone was celebrating her the entire flight. Older model 737 but clean and comfortable.  Offboarding and baggage claim were easy in Budapest.Flipside:Our return flight was on an American 780 series aircraft.  We were first in line to check in on an early morning flight with all documentation ready.  The person at the check in counter had obviously had a rough night and was not a happy individual.

0.9967,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,40.0,Great in-flight entertainment!,"I checked in easily for this flight via the American Airlines app. I knew the flight would be full as every seat on the seat map was taken when I checked in, and American was offering to take bids for volunteers to be bumped at the gate or change flights free of charge. I decided to wait until the gate to see what they would offer. Security was a breeze, though there was no Clear lane at this terminal at MIA, which was disappointing -- at least TSA Pre-Check was open and there was no line. I waited out my time before my flight at the American Express Centurion Lounge, which was nice and I enjoyed several drinks and a warm, hot buffet meal before my flight. I proceeded to the gate extra early to inquire about whether they would need volunteers and what they would offer. I was told that they were offering $675 to take a later flight, but that it wasn't likely that they would actually need volunteers -- in fact, the gate agent seemed surprised by my inquiry. The gate agent told me that she would all me about 10 minutes before boarding and let me know either way, which was appreciated and meant that I wouldn't have to board last to find out if they'd in fact need me. Sure enough, the gate agent called me as promised to tell me that she wouldn't need me, but that my upgrade to First Class had cleared. I felt as if I had won the lottery and was quite grateful. Soon enough, First Class boarding was called and I boarded the aircraft to my aisle seat in the second row of First Class. There was no pre-departure beverage but headphones were handed out before departure for the in-flight entertainment. I SO appreciated the personal televisions on this aircraft and the high speed wi-fi. American has just ripped these out of their 737 aircraft, which is a major disappointment and downgrade relative to their competition including Delta and JetBlue. Once in the air, the service was pretty bare bones, but still better than Delta! I was offered a turkey and arugula sandwich, which came with a delicious chocolate chip cookie. I sincerely hope American brings back the pre-pandemic in-flight service to domestic First Class soon, including hot meals, a towel, and hot mixed nuts. Drinks were proactively offered, including doubles, though in plastic cups, not real glassware, which was disappointing and hardly premium. Overall, this was a good flight, but there are certainly areas where American can improve if it truly wants to be the best US carrier.","{'neg': 0.044, 'neu': 0.779, 'pos': 0.177, 'compound': 0.9967}",0.9967
0.9969,2022-01-01,2022-01-01,10.0,I am upset that the numerical criteria do not allow me to reflect how I actually feel,"I am upset that the numerical criteria do not allow me to reflect how I actually feel. The rating seems to be geared entirely around the experience on the aircraft, which was an admittedly fine experience. The issues I have with Delta were the entire rest of the experience.The mobile app looks and functions terribly. I have flown on most major airlines as I travel a great deal for work and scheduling is often more important than brand loyalty. This is the worst app I have used. The mobile ticket on the route to location did not function at all. Said I couldn't check in and would not display my boarding pass. So I had to show up early to the airport to get my ticket from the agent. This is where the second issue shows up.The Delta staff in each of the 4 different airports I visited were collectively the least helpful employees I have ever worked with. I have never seen a collective workforce seemingly intent on not helping as I did with Delta. I show up to the airport at 3:30 AM as my international flight leaves at 6:00 AM. There is already a line of 20 or so people at the Delta check in location as there is not one employee. When we finally see one at 4:00 AM he is walking slowly through the line asking each one of us where we are flying. After all of that he stands in front and just starts yelling for international flights to form one line, flights to Denver to form a different one, and so on. This would be great except he is still the only person here. So now we are just waiting in different lines. Finally a wave of 4 people come out and start taking customers. This is very slow and the ilne has continued to grow and is now probably 200 people. 3 more people show up and just stand behind the four working. There are plenty of open stations, but we now have 4 people helping customers and 4 people watching. Three presumed managers and the line maker.Get to the line and my wife and I are only given one of our tickets, but we are told that we will get our next ticket in Salt Lake. Make it through to my flight with about 20 minutes to spare, but I am TSA Precheck. I feel sorry for the 20 or so International passengers behind me who may or may not have been.Arrive at our first layover in Salt Lake and head right to the gate to get our tickets. We are told we are not on this flight. That is probably the reason they could not print our second ticket, but why solve that probably in Portland when you could push it to an employee in Salt Lake? Perfect. To their credit I did interact with the solely helpful employee in Salt Lake. I wish I had time to catch her name, but she moved us onto a flight that was currently boarding so we ran to that flight and are on the way to Mexico.As we sit down we realize that our checked luggage is probably not making it. We asked one of the flight attendants who directed us to the app to track our bag, which claims it is still in Portland. She tells us not to worry and it will be there when we land. It was not.We are told it is still in Salt Lake when we land in Cancun and it will be here sometime. They think tomorrow. It did indeed show up the next day. Luckily my wife and I packed a day's worth of clothing in our carry on.Now we fly back. Mobile app issues again. I can only get ONE of our boarding passes. My boarding pass says I need to complete check in, but when I try and complete check in it says I have completed it. Great. Back to the airport early to deal with this. I am told that the two legs of my flight are somehow on different reservations because I changed my flight? I told them I did nothing of the sort and I got a notification the day before that Delta delayed my layover. They tell me I did something wrong while changing it so I can only get one ticket again. I am told to go to my gate when I land and get my new ticket. Fine.Then we get to the gate and my Wife’s mobile ticket now says “Too close to boarding time. Ticket unavailable” WHEN ELSE WOULD I NEED MY TICKET? So now during boarding we are standing in line at the gate to print HER ticket. Scanned and she is in. They scan my ticket and I am not on this flight. Another employee slamming away at a computer for 2 minutes and I am back on the flight. I am sure we will have no issues in Atlanta.Arrive in Atlanta and go to my gate as instructed, granted we are 3 hours before boarding at this point, and stand in front of the employee sitting there:Me: Hello!Delta Employee: Hi.M: How is it going today?D: How can I help you?M: I was unable to get my second ticket in Cancun was told to get my ticket hereD: Someone will be here one hour before boarding and you will get your ticket.M: I was told to get it as soon as I landed. I have had a few issues with me not being on certain flights this trip and would like to just have my ticket in hand. They gave me my ticket numberD: Someone will be here one hour before boarding to help you.M: You are here right now, can we not just print it now so if there is an issue I could handle it?D: No. Someone will be here-M: Fine thank you so much you have been a huge helpI did get my ticket and I was on the flight. So there was no issue, but I cannot believe how difficult and tedious it was navigating the Delta experience. Their planes are fine. Their Flight Attendants are pleasant. Their snacks are standard. They are a perfectly normal airline in the air, but the interactions I had with the staff in the airport were all terrible. I found myself shaking my head and questioning how they could be awarded #1 in customer satisfaction in 2021. I was willing to give the benefit of the doubt in Portland with short staff and an early morning. But every single employee I talked to in airports was so annoyed that I talked to them and pointed out the issues I was having. As I mentioned I fly a lot and almost never need to interact with the staff in airports, but the few times I have with other airlines have all been at least pleasant. I have had flights delayed, and switched and I don’t really care. So long as I get to my destination I understand stuff happens. I just cannot believe how troublesome it was to get my questions answered.I mentioned above that I don’t have brand loyalty and typically fly whichever flight is at a convenient time, but I will now filter our Delta flights.","{'neg': 0.042, 'neu': 0.867, 'pos': 0.091, 'compound': 0.9969}",0.9969
0.9969,2020-11-01,2020-11-01,40.0,Good Flight on Southwest,"Southwest Airlines Flight 920PDX-DEN11:20 am-4:45 pm Boeing 737-800This flight from Denver to Philadelphia was the second leg of a trip home from Portland, and after a much more chaotic experience on our first flight from Portland to Denver, this flight was a breeze. It was a flight with good service, a nice newer aircraft, and an early arrival at PHL.Denver Airport was surprisingly busy on the day we were there, which we did not anticipate in the middle of the pandemic, but it was easy enough to connect between Southwest flights, since they’re all in the same concourse. Boarding for this flight began right on time, and just like on our other flight, the gate agent announced that due to Covid, the normal lining up by boarding number would not occur. Instead, they would just call 5 boarding numbers at a time to proceed directly to the gate for boarding. I actually thought this was generally easier than forcing everyone to line up by number and cram in with their luggage between the marked poles in the boarding area. I’d prefer if it just stayed this way even after the pandemic.We had boarding positions A45 and A46 and were able to get a row quite close to the front of the aircraft. Since Southwest is currently blocking middle seats, it was nice to know that we’d have the entire row to ourselves. I also noticed that this plane had one of the newer Southwest interiors, which we had not had on any previous Southwest flight. My wife and I both commented that although the seats seemed a bit less cushioned than on the older Southwest planes, they were equally comfortable, and the overall space and legroom seemed even better with these thinner seats.The aircraft was very hot throughout the boarding process, and one of the flight attendants made an announcement saying that they were hoping to get it working once we left the gate. I thought the plane remained hot throughout the flight, but it got a little better once we were en route. In-flight service on this flight was good, and I thought the flight attendants were friendly and attentive. They came around even before we left Denver to collect any personal cleaning wipes we had used to clean our seats, and the in-flight service, while stripped down as compared to the past, was efficient. Southwest is currently only offering cups of water for a beverage, along with their standard snack mix, which is fine for me. They also came around at least two additional times with more water if anyone wanted it over the course of this 3.5 hour flight, which was nice.Wifi was available throughout the flight, and features a variety of free movies and tv shows to stream, and you can also sign-on to get access to iMessage and Whatsapp for free using the wifi, which is a good way to stay connected in the air. I also like that you can see a map of exactly where the plane is throughout the flight using the wifi. The only other amenity that would have been helpful to have is an outlet to charge your phone during the flight, which was not offered.I really had no complaints about the flight itself, particularly since we ultimately arrived in Philadelphia 30 minutes early. It was a pretty standard Southwest flight that went well. Baggage also made its way onto the carousel within a reasonable amount of time, so we were out of the airport and on our way home earlier than we were even supposed to land originally. After a more stressful Southwest flight earlier in the morning, this flight was a pleasant experience.","{'neg': 0.027, 'neu': 0.842, 'pos': 0.131, 'compound': 0.9969}",0.9969

I understand that america is about the economy, and consumerism, there has to be a line drawn somewhere though. I booked a flight for a buisness trip within the states which I would consider flying american airlines would be patriotic by showing some financial support toward the company because america, you know.  My buisness trip was extended by quite some hours on the last day which was supposed to be the day I fly out. Now this is where the review has some constructive critiscism, I called customer service which I got a pretty fast response. The employee I was talking to explained there was going to be a price diffrence which I respected. I am going to let it out now I payed around $180 roundtrip for two weeks of a time frame. I was not able to modify to a flight within the same day but later becuse the price diffrence was cheaper the next day, I was okay with that due to my inconveiniencing toward the company.   I paid maybe $210 for the diffrence for a one day modification. On my behalf I then explained the cost to my employeer and I was advised to not ""financially stress"" myself for that price so I then called customer support again to re-modify my flight back to the original ( it seems like I am complaining, I know) but when I was informed by customer service there was a price difference again I almost had to recalculate because why was there a price diffrence to go back to a cheaper departure which happend to be my original. I blamed the economy in my head but the customer support told me AA used to automatically charge $200, so I thought to myself where is the same financial empathy I showed by originally booking this company becuse america. The answer is capitalism, I was then charged $8 cool becuse I get it then tax which makes since The gov has to get their portion of the end aswell. By the way there is no refunds okay I get it but why charge me when I revert back to my original departure. Where I am baffled is when there was a email sent to me explaining my original departure might be pretty packed so they offrered a free flight modification and yes I took it because I got to sleep a few extra hours, now this free flight also happend to be on the same day as my original but a few hours later. I get it everyone we are in a economic crisis along with a helath pandemimc, but come on ceo and friends of American Airlines why did you have to spit in my face like this through your means of capitalism.

0.9969,2021-04-01,2021-04-01,7.0,"""SLC is a sterling, world-class airport, with some wrinkles""","  | SLC is a sterling, world-class airport, with some wrinkles. To begin, I absolutely do not understand the onslaught of negative reviews for the newly-completed (and still under-construction) SLC redo. The only explanation I can think of is that those negative reviews are from people driving in from some place like Magna, West Valley, Brigham City, or Wendover who just don't like big cities and big changes. Let me start with the positives of the new SLC, and there are many: 1) TSA staff who are helpful, polite, and explanatory, who don't bark orders officiously, and who efficiently process passengers. The best TSA I've encountered in almost any airport in the USA, except possibly some small airports like Lexington. 2) Architecturally stunning, post-contemporary, and a generally relaxing, open-air design; the closest thing I've seen in the USA to a Seoul Incheon, Hong Kong, and Sydney's Kingsford Smith (though those airports are even more beautiful). 3) Countless art displays in the terminal, completed concourses, and the underground walkway connecting the concourses at present. 4) Dining and shopping options in the Delta concourse (A). 5) Ample displays and signage, from the time you leave I-80 or North Temple to the time you arrive at your gate. 6) Luggage carts prominently located at the entry to the terminal (although you have to pay for them, and I don't like that we have to do that at US airports in general when you don't always have to in other countries). 7) Accessibility by highway, TRAX light rail, or rideshare is a breeze. 8) It's close to downtown, and still a 45-minute drive from Park City, Antelope Island, etc. 9) The restrooms (men's anyway) have stalls which afford full privacy, common in western Europe and wealthier Asian countries but rare in the US. Now, there are some drawbacks that will need to be worked out: 1) There really needs to be significantly improved accessibility between the terminal, baggage claim and concourses, hopefully the new tunnel under construction will remedy that, but there is no excuse for this airport to not already have an active tram. However, despite the naysayers' reviews, it takes 15 minutes to walk across the airport, not 30 minutes. 2) The food and dining options in concourse B (Alaska, Frontier, Southwest, etc.) could stand to be more numerous. I'll also say that while Uinta Brewing is a great place for a locally-brewed beer, they could stand some competition, as the service frankly wasn't very attentive or friendly. 3) The Southwest personnel weren't very friendly, though at least they weren't rude or hostile like I've experienced from SWA at other airports. 4) If you want to rent a car from SLC, you'll be paying a ridiculous airport surcharge of some kind, I took an Uber to and from Millcreek to rent a car. Even considering the cost of Uber, I still saved $80-100 rather than renting at the airport. I noticed that the rental car facilities from Farmington all the way down to Sandy were almost entirely booked, but the airport still had rental cars available. This is an obvious problem. 5) The WiFI is terrible and needs to actually be accessible for passengers. So, wonderful job overall, SLC! In fact, I'm impressed. Just work out your wrinkles, always find ways to improve and execute plans of action, and you can complete with the very best in Europe and even some in east Asia!","{'neg': 0.033, 'neu': 0.823, 'pos': 0.144, 'compound': 0.9969}",0.9969
0.9972,2021-01-01,2021-01-01,50.0,Good AA flight between hubs,"American Airlines Flight 872PHL-DFW6:45-9:42 am Airbus A321SMy wife and I recently took this morning flight from Philadelphia to Dallas/Fort Worth before connecting onto an American Eagle flight to Aspen. This was actually a very good flight that felt a bit more normal than some other flights we’ve taken during the pandemic, at least based on the service in first class. We were originally booked in economy for all legs of this trip, but when checking in for the flight online the day before, we were offered a paid upgrade to first class for the Philadelphia to Dallas leg for $95 per person. I thought this was a little pricey, but I was eager to have extra space and a guaranteed private row for the two of us, so I decided to pay for the upgrade. We arrived at PHL about an hour before the scheduled 6:45 am departure and had no wait or difficulty when checking our bags using the self-tagging kiosks in the Terminal B/C priority check-in area. The Terminal C security checkpoint, which was previously for pre-check only and is usually our preferred option, had been closed for other flights we’ve taken during the pandemic. This time, I saw that the Terminal C checkpoint was open again and figured we’d use it, even though our flight was from Terminal B. However, it unfortunately appears that they have opened this checkpoint to everyone and it’s no longer for pre-check only. They had lines for both regular screening and pre-check at Terminal C, which slightly slowed things down as compared to past trips. Regardless, we were still through security quickly and off to the gate for boarding.The flight must have started boarding early, since we arrived at the gate right on time for the scheduled boarding and had missed Group 1–they were already boarding Group 4. During boarding, the flight attendants handed out the now standard bags that include hand sanitizer wipes, a small bottle of water, and Biscoff cookies.  We settled into our seats and appreciated that this is one of the better A321s, which includes power outlets at each seat and individual seatback TVs. This is unlike the legacy-US Airways A321s we usually have on flights from Philadelphia, which have basically no amenities at all.We left the gate 10 minutes early and took off very quickly. Shortly after we were in the air, the first class flight attendant came around and took our drink orders. I was pleasantly surprised that drinks were offered, since I know most service has been cut or severely limited during the pandemic on AA flights. The flight attendant was very nice and addressed everyone by name while taking orders, before coming back shortly with the mimosas we had requested. After that, he came back and offered everyone in first class a choice of two pre-packaged Zoe’s Kitchen meals, either a turkey and swiss breakfast sandwich or strawberry yogurt with blueberries and granola. We had one of each and were happy with the food. It was basic but good enough, and we were just glad that food of any type was offered. Since the flight was over three hours, I think a second round of drinks would have been nice, but this was not offered. However, I do think if we had asked the flight attendant for another drink, he would have been happy to get it.Wifi was available on the flight, with several items offered for free, including a variety of movies, tv shows, and Apple Music to stream, along with lots of entertainment and a flight map with flight connection information on the seatback TVs.The flight attendants did make several of the standard announcements about required mask wearing during the flight, and I didn’t see any non-compliance from passengers.  We made it to our gate in Dallas about 15 minutes early, giving plenty of time to take the Skylink train from Terminal C to Terminal E for our next flight.Overall, this flight from PHL-DFW was very nice, with good service from American. The plane was clean with comfortable, large seats and good service in first class, so we were very satisfied with the experience.","{'neg': 0.038, 'neu': 0.837, 'pos': 0.126, 'compound': 0.9972}",0.9972
0.9975,2020-07-01,2020-07-01,20.0,Crowded flight with a rough group of passengers,"American Airlines Flight 1993MCO-PHL2:04-4:35 pm Airbus A321This flight was to return from a quick weekend trip to Orlando, and since it was our second AA flight that weekend, we were a bit more prepared for the lack of social distancing and crowded nature of being on a plane than we had been two days before. We knew to expect that no seats would be blocked out for distancing purposes, and that it would probably be a pretty full flight, which it was. Overall, the flight was ok, but the crowd of passengers was really rough, with a lot of very loud kids and adults and poor compliance with the mask-wearing requirements, which was disappointing.   We had purchased Basic Economy tickets for only $40 each, and we decided not to pay for seats in advance, since a good number of seats had not been assigned when we looked at the seat map a couple days prior. There were three people in our party, and we were assigned a standard row of three seats toward the back of the plane when checking in online right at the 24-hour mark. Since we have the AA credit card, our checked bags were free, making Basic Economy really no different than paying for a much more expensive regular ticket. It was a good deal.When we arrived at MCO for the flight, it was immediately clear that this airport is busy. It wasn’t as busy as it would have been a year ago, but it was much more of a “normal” feeling of commotion than we witnessed at our home airport (PHL) two days prior. The AA check-in area was crowded, although we were able to find an open kiosk immediately and were on our way quickly. When we were in line for the bag drop, I definitely noticed that people were not very good about leaving space between parties. It would have been a big help if AA had included social distancing markers in queues to help groups see where they should stand while waiting. The agent who took our bags was very nice and quickly had us on our way.Although it’s not AA’s fault, we saw a lot of poor compliance with mask wearing at MCO. So many people (passengers, staff, and airline crew) were not wearing masks properly, and leaving their noses or mouth (or both) uncovered, with no one to really enforce the rules. We were pretty uncomfortable walking around MCO due to the combination of crowds and lax mask wearing. This is unlike how it generally is where we’re from in the Northeast, so it was a little surprising to see.The flight boarded on time, and proceeded very much the same as always, with people crowding the gate trying to board the plane. Since we had checked our luggage and didn’t have carry-ons needing overhead bin space, we decided to wait until the very end of the boarding process, and we were some of the last people to board once everything was clear.  The flight was pretty full, and the seats with standard legroom that we had in the main cabin had the standard space and comfort that you’d find on any AA flight. Everything did seem relatively clean, but not noticeably different from any flight before the pandemic. After we wiped down our seats with Clorox wipes, one of the flight attendants pointed out to us that our seats had small paper garbage bags in them that we could use to dispose of the wipes, which was nice. I don’t think our flight on the way to Orlando had these, and it was nice to have something to hold small trash items.Unfortunately, right around us were a lot of the worst behaved passengers on the flight, which included a lot of groups with loud, unsupervised kids, and adults who were equally poorly behaved and not wearing masks properly. The groups around us would have been gross on any flight, but especially during the pandemic, we could not wait to get away from them ASAP.On this flight there weren’t as many announcements made about safety and modifications related to Covid as there were on our way down to Florida, but announcements were made about the mandatory mask rule and the fact that flight attendants would be monitoring compliance throughout the flight. I appreciated that one of the flight attendants actually did come by a couple of times to check masks, and corrected those who weren’t wearing them properly.We ended up leaving the gate a few minutes early, and waited about 20 minutes to take off, even though there didn’t seem to be any planes ahead of us waiting to take off. The flight was fine, with no food or drink service provided due to the pandemic, making it a pretty basic, bare bones flight. Other than any cost difference, there’s really no reason to choose American over a budget carrier like Spirit or Frontier right now. The A321 doesn’t really offer any amenities, although wifi was available to watch free in-flight movies on aa.com. The flight was uneventful, with very little contact with flight attendants since no service is being offered. We arrived at our gate in Philadelphia right on time.  Just as they had done on our flight to Florida two days earlier, the flight attendants made an announcement after we landed to encourage people not to jump up in the aisles as soon as the seatbelt sign was turned off. They asked everyone to de-plane row by row in order to promote physical distancing. It was very disappointing that a large number of passengers on this flight ignored this completely, and felt the need to jump up and clog the aisles/have unnecessary contact while waiting to get off the aircraft.Overall, our flight to Philadelphia was fine, but we were not comfortable with the combination of AA not creating any space on the planes and the crowd on this flight being very rough with lax behaviors around mask wearing. We did our best to keep to ourselves safe, but we didn’t enjoy the flight experience.","{'neg': 0.054, 'neu': 0.824, 'pos': 0.123, 'compound': 0.9975}",0.9975
0.9978,2020-11-01,2020-11-01,40.0,Pleasant Flight,"American Airlines Flight 2820ORD-PDX8:25-10:56 am Boeing 737-800My wife and I recently took a flight on American from Chicago to Portland, Oregon, after connecting in Chicago from Philadelphia. Similar to our earlier flight that morning, the flight was very much a standard experience for a flight on American during the pandemic. The flight was totally fine and pretty unremarkable. The flight boarded right on time, and flight attendants handed out hand sanitizer wipes as we boarded, along with a bag that included a package of Biscoff cookies and a mini water bottle.  We were also happy to find that even though American is not blocking middle seats like some of its competitors, the flight wasn’t full, and we had our own row to ourselves. Since this flight was over 4 hours long, we had purchased Main Cabin Extra seats with extra legroom toward the front of the economy cabin, which I’m glad we did. Although I was not particularly impressed by the amount of “extra” legroom that these seats had for the price (I think some other airlines, such as JetBlue, may have an equivalent amount of space as their standard legroom), it was definitely more comfortable than if we had been sitting in standard economy seats. Despite the Boeing 737-800 not having the most generous legroom, I did appreciate that the seats had both full outlets and USB plugs for easy charging during the flight, and the phone/iPad stand at the top of the seat came in handy as well.  We left the gate a few minutes early, quickly took off, and made it to Portland about 10 minutes early. The pilot initially said that we would probably be late arriving in Portland due to bad weather along the way, but said they would do their best to go faster, and I appreciated that this actually happened. Wifi was available on the flight, with several entertainment options offered for free, including a variety of movies, tv shows, and Apple Music to stream. I also used the AA app to track our flight using the free portion of the wifi.Other than the cookie/water bags given during boarding, there was no service on this flight. I understand trying to limit contact and service during the pandemic, and I was glad we were given something, but I think it would have been appropriate to at least come around one other time to offer more water bottles or cookies based on the length of the flight. The flight attendants were coming around constantly to pick up trash, so it’s not as if they wouldn’t have been able to give out more water as well.The flight attendants did make several of the standard announcements about required mask wearing during the flight, and they were pretty forceful about it, which I appreciated. Most passengers around us were relatively compliant, although some people were definitely stretching the allowance to take off their masks when “eating or drinking.” When we landed, the flight attendants instructed everyone to stay in their seats after the seatbelt sign was turned off so that passengers could de-plane row-by-row and not clog the aisles. Everyone did listen, so I was glad we had a very civilized process of disembarking the aircraft.Overall, this flight from Chicago to Portland was good, with standard service from American. The plane was clean and the flight was early, with enough space for us to spread out. Other than feeling like seats were a bit tight, even in Main Cabin Extra, we were comfortable enough and had a pleasant flight.","{'neg': 0.011, 'neu': 0.844, 'pos': 0.145, 'compound': 0.9978}",0.9978
0.9978,2020-08-01,2020-08-01,50.0,First Time Flyer,"I was a few days shy of my 42nd birthday when I took my first flight ever. My doctors had cleared me to fly. I have a condition known as malignant cardiac vasovagal syncope and three structural heart issues. Basically, if I pass out due to any kind of stress, my heart and lungs quit for a little bit. This can be aggravated by lack of sleep and dehydration. I was very excited when the plane left the ground and felt like a little kid on their first roller coaster ride and was sharing this excitement with an older woman who was seasoned in flying. This was a two-flight trip and this first stretch to Chicago Midway Airport. About 20 minutes before landing I was beginning to experience the first signs of problems. The two attendants on this flight were perfect! Their training was evident, but their humanity and honest concern shown through like a beacon in the fog. A am a former E.M.T. , former volunteer firefighter, fire company president, fire police, and have been in the workforce of the healthcare system since I was 18 years old. When you, yourself, are the patient, it’s very difficult to be your own support system or “rescuer “. That being said, the grace given by these attendants was what kept me just on this side of consciousness. When we landed in Midway, I was able to walk and talk, but just barely. I had just a little over an hour till my second flight. One of the attendants assisted me of the plane and even carried my  very heavy carry on bag in order to help me get to the bathroom and the store for food and Gatorade with salt and to help me get to the next flight’s boarding lobby. The Chicago Fire Company (I do not know which division ) responded to the airport to evaluate my condition. They were very respectful and regarded my privacy with a professional support that was very reassuring. The woman who was perhaps a manager for Southwest Airlines at Chicago Midway was very kind and very professional. As the paramedics and team of firefighters were working on me, she had the airport doctor on her cellphone. My coherency level was just starting to come back, meaning I was just beginning to have the ability of communicable speech again. This is “normal” for people with this condition, though it leaves you in a euphoric exhausted state. This is also when you start getting your awareness levels back again and can become very self-conscious. It can be very embarrassing. They all were very reassuring, regardless. I spoke with the doctor on the phone and knew the line of questioning intimately. In other words, he did his job accurately and professionally. He was also very kind and understood my condition without me having to explain, other than the diagnosis itself (most healthcare providers do not know, nor understand how to treat this specific condition)(one wrong move can cause the patient to go into cardiac arrest). I hadn’t realized at the time, though I should’ve known it, that I was extremely dehydrated and hadn’t slept in almost three days. This and the excitement so stressed my body out and it was reacting negatively to the stresses. After the doctors medically cleared me, having given me strict instruction (which I most certainly followed ), I was able to board my second flight in time. The option was given to me that they could set a later flight for me if I needed more time (I was trembling). The option was helpful, but I decided to continue forward on the scheduled flight. Once on the second plane, it was slightly larger, and I chose a seat near the back closer to the attendants, further from other passengers (still embarrassed and concerned it might happen again) behind the wing. The second flight was about 5 hours? I’m still not certain. I couldn’t in good conscience not have the flight attendants be prepared for the possibility of my condition affecting me yet again, so I asked one of them if anyone had contacted them about what has happened on the last flight. Remember, I’ma former E.M.T., firefighter, etc.  They were surprised by my question and just as I began tiredly attempting to explain my condition to them, the wonderful woman who had handed me her cellphone to talk to the doctor then entered the airplane and gave the attendants all of the information they required to deal with any potential situation. They gave me multiple packages of pretzels (salty items) to compliment my Gatorade so as to add to my hydration levels. The whole time the plane was taking off, and throughout the flight, the attendants were amazingly, well, attendant. At the same time, they were non-invasive and very reassuring. I don’t know what was happening with communication behind the scenes, but I know that I will never travel with anyone else. It will probably take a miracle to get me back on a plane again, but, if I must, it will be with them and only them. May God bless each and every one of you as you all blessed me that day. All of my gratitude to you. Thank you for being so wonderful❤️","{'neg': 0.05, 'neu': 0.818, 'pos': 0.132, 'compound': 0.9978}",0.9978
0.9979,2020-07-01,2020-07-01,30.0,Not bad for a flight during the pandemic,"American Airlines Flight 1565PHL-MCO8:20-11:01 am Airbus A319My wife and I recently took our first flight during the height of the pandemic for a weekend in Orlando. Overall, the flight was fine, since we made it to Orlando quite a bit early and had no real issues. However, the lack of any sort of social distancing or spacing on the flight felt a little weird, even though I already knew that American wasn’t blocking out seats on its flights anymore and that this flight would be full. We’re not particularly nervous about traveling, or we wouldn’t have taken the trip at all, but it was just a little more jarring than I expected to walk back onto a full flight for the first time in months.The day before our flight, we received an email from American stating that our flight was going to be full, and that we could switch flights for free if we wanted to do so. The flight was so full that the app was also offering compensation to anyone who was willing to give up their seat. We didn’t have any flexibility in our plans, so we stuck with this flight anyway.We had purchased Basic Economy tickets for only $40 each, and we had paid an additional $15 each for advance seat assignments to ensure we’d be seated together. Since we have the AA credit card, our checked bags were free, making Basic Economy really no different than paying for a much more expensive regular ticket. It was a good deal.When we arrived at PHL in the morning, the airport was very dead compared to what we’re used to. The check-in counters for Terminal B/C had no lines, and we were able to check our bags quickly using one of the kiosks. The same was the case for security. We were told that Terminal C security at PHL was closed (which is typically where we go for precheck), so we went to the Terminal B security checkpoint and expected that we’d have to do regular security. We were very pleasantly surprised to find out that one of the lanes at Terminal B was being used for precheck, so we were able to have expedited screening.The flight boarded on time, and proceeded very much the same as always, with people crowding the gate trying to board the plane. Since we had checked our luggage and didn’t have carry-ons needing overhead bin space, we decided to wait until the very end of the boarding process, and we were some of the last people to board once everything was clear.  The flight was completely full, and the seats with standard legroom that we had in the main cabin had the standard space and comfort that you’d find on any AA flight. We were lucky that the third seat in our row ended up being one of the only empty seats on the plane (solely because a third member of our party who would have been seated there ended up not coming with us on the flight, but never cancelled his ticket). Everything did seem relatively clean, but not noticeably different from any flight before the pandemic. Once boarding was complete, the pilot made several announcements related to health and safety, which we appreciated. He went over the mandatory face covering requirement and specified that flight attendants would enforce the rules throughout the flight, with a threat of being banned for life for any passenger who refused to wear a face covering. He also discussed the extra cleaning procedures and function of HEPA filters on the plane. All of this made me feel a bit more comfortable about flying. It was kind of annoying that once everyone was seated, several passengers started getting up and trying to switch seats or get new seat assignments. It seemed that a bunch of people traveling together had purchased Basic Economy tickets and ended up with scattered seat assignments, but wanted to be together. In my opinion, the flight attendants were too accommodating with these requests, which led to a lot of commotion and unnecessary contact between passengers as people around us were all getting up and switching seats after everyone had already all been seated. We ended up leaving the gate almost 10 minutes early, and since air traffic is limited right now, we took off quickly. The flight was fine, with no food or drink service due to the pandemic, making it a pretty basic, bare bones flight. Other than any cost difference, there’s really no reason to choose American over a budget carrier like Spirit or Frontier right now. The A319 did have power outlets at each seat, which was nice, and wifi was available to watch free in-flight movies on aa.com. The flight was uneventful, with very little contact with flight attendants since no service is being offered. We arrived at our gate in Orlando over 30 minutes early, with a couple minutes of an extra wait on the ground because there was initially no ground staff available to help park the plane at the gate.The flight attendants made an announcement after we landed to encourage people not to jump up in the aisles as soon as the seatbelt sign was turned off. They asked everyone to de-plane row by row in order to promote physical distancing. I was actually shocked that for the most part, people did listen to this and did not stand up until the row in front of them had cleared the area. Any time I’ve seen flight crew ask passengers to remain seated in the past (such as to help people with tight connections get off first), I’ve very rarely seen people listen.Overall, our flight to Orlando was totally fine. We were happy to arrive early and we did everything we could to be safe. Mask compliance was pretty good on the flight (although not perfect), and things felt surprisingly normal once we got past the initial stages of uncertainty of how it would be to fly right now. It would have been nice to see more distancing or lower capacity on the plane, but AA is simply not offering this anymore.","{'neg': 0.054, 'neu': 0.822, 'pos': 0.124, 'compound': 0.9979}",0.9979
0.9979,2021-07-01,2021-07-01,40.0,Very good flight experience,"American Airlines Flight 1401PHL-FLL7:00 am-9:45 am Boeing 737-800I recently took this flight with my family and service dog on a trip to South Florida, and I was very happy with the experience on American. We had originally booked a flight with Spirit on the same route that day, but after an issue with seating that came up less than 24 hours before departure, we ended up cancelling that flight last minute and booking this flight instead. This flight ended up having the perfect timing to get us where we needed to be in a pinch, and even with last minute fares, the price wasn’t bad (actually less than we had paid on Spirit with all fees included).When I booked the flight on less than 24 hours’ notice, there were no standard seats left to choose in economy, but I did see that there were five Preferred seats together for our group (i.e., seats closer to the front that don’t have extra legroom, but usually cost extra). I was prepared to pay for those seats if needed, but decided to chance it and see if they’d be assigned to us for free during online check-in, and they were. The system put us automatically in the exact row I was hoping for, where we had a full row of three seats and two more across the aisle. Since we were flying with a service dog for the first time, it was important to us to have a row just to ourselves, so we wouldn’t have to bother other passengers in any way. I also had to contact AA before our flight regarding our service dog. Although she was previously approved for our flight home that was always going to be on American, and AA had issued her a service dog ID that is valid on any flight for a year, I needed to get them to attach it to this new reservation. The wait times on hold for the special services desk were almost two hours that day, but I eventually got through. They were very nice, and added the information right away. I appreciated that even on short notice, my service dog could be added to the reservation with no issues.We arrived at Philadelphia Airport about 90 minutes before the scheduled 7:00 am departure. Since parking in the airport garages at PHL has gotten very full lately with the economy lot still closed, we had to budget some extra time for parking, but we got a spot easily enough by looking on higher levels of the garage. The flight was departing from Terminal A-East, so we made our way to the A-East check-in area, which is a bit smaller than American’s counters in other terminals. There was a decently long line of people waiting for full-service check-in, while many of the self-service kiosks were open. Since we just needed to check bags, I tried to use the kiosk. However, when an employee saw that we had a service dog, she told me that we would be unable to check-in there and had to wait in the full-service line because of the dog. This actually went against what the special services desk had told me, which was that no special check-in for the service dog was required, since we had her fully pre-approved. However, not wanting to make an issue of it, we went over and waited in the long full-service line. There were only a couple of agents working the standard check-in line that morning, and it seemed that every group ahead of us was having a major issue/transaction. No one seemed to know how to pack or pay for bags, and several groups that were taking trips to the Caribbean were creating a backup while the staff members very slowly checked their necessary paperwork, Covid tests, etc. for their destinations. Even with those added steps, service was moving at a snail’s pace. It would have been nice if they had thought to re-allocate staff to help move the line along, since they had at least three staff members at bag drop, who mostly appeared to be standing there doing nothing. Once we finally got to the front of the line, we were able to get our bags checked quickly and the agent asked for our service dog paperwork, which I had a copy of for her to review. Seeing no issues, we were sent on our way.Security at Terminal A-East was easy with no real line. It was disappointing to see that the separate Precheck lane was closed, but for those of us with Precheck, we were given a pass allowing us to keep our shoes on. They did still make us remove all electronics from our bags, which is not usually required with Precheck.There had been thunderstorms and pouring rain in the area the entire night before and the day of our flight, so we were nervous about potential delays or cancellations (lots of flights were cancelled due to weather that morning), but the flight boarded right on time. It was a full flight, and had the standard chaotic process with everyone rushing the gate to board with their group. It also didn’t help that it was hard to hear the announcements for each boarding group. The aircraft ended up having extra-large overhead bins that easily fit everyone’s carry-on bags with plenty of space, so there was no need for the rush to get on and get overhead bin space. I’ve heard gate agents announce this information before, which could have been helpful here. When we boarded, the flight attendants were very nice and commented on how cute they thought my dog is, which I appreciated.We left the gate a couple minutes early, quickly took off, and generally had a smooth and uneventful flight to Fort Lauderdale. In addition to the liking the large overhead bins, I generally found the Boeing 737-800 aircraft to be well-designed, even though I know it was the newer Oasis configuration that many people don’t like. I liked that every seat in economy had both full outlets and USB plugs for easy charging during the flight, and the phone/iPad stand at the top of the seat came in handy as well. Legroom in the standard economy seats was tight, especially with a service dog at our feet, so I’d probably pay for Main Cabin Extra seats with extra legroom in the future with a service dog.Wifi was available on the flight, with several things offered for free, including a variety of movies, tv shows, and Apple Music to stream. I also used the AA app to track our flight and the time until arrival.As the flight went on, I was surprised that no food or beverage service was being offered, since American had brought it back on flights we had been on in the spring. However, pretty close to the end of the flight, the flight attendants finally came around with the drink cart, offering full cans of soda, or juice or water, in addition to a choice of pretzels or Biscoff cookies. I’m not sure what delayed them in coming around for service, but they were very nice and even offered our dog some water, which was thoughtful.The flight attendants did make the standard announcements about required mask wearing during the flight, and I didn’t see any non-compliance from passengers. I didn’t like, however, that the pilot also came on with his own mask announcement that felt politically charged. He heavily implied that he doesn’t think masks should be required, and basically told everyone to do what they wanted as long as we’re “nice to each other and stay off the news.” He should just have been reading the standard announcement that had been prepared for him to deliver. It’s unprofessional and uncomfortable when things take a political turn from the pilot.We ultimately arrived at our gate in Fort Lauderdale a few minutes early, and luggage was available in a pretty standard amount of time at baggage claim. We’ve definitely had luggage come out more quickly, but it was far from noteworthy in a bad way either. Overall, this flight from Philadelphia to Fort Lauderdale was good. I appreciated how nice the flight attendants were, which really helped with any nervousness we had about flying with our service dog for the first time. We left on time, arrived on time, and were on an AA aircraft with basic features that we appreciated.","{'neg': 0.05, 'neu': 0.848, 'pos': 0.102, 'compound': 0.9979}",0.9979

It was a relatively short and simple flight that departed and arrived on time, and we had great space in exit row seats. Everyone from American Airlines that we encountered along the way was quite nice too, which was a pleasant surprise for this airline.We arrived at Nashville Airport around 4:30 am for the 6:00 am flight, which was more than enough time to return our rental car, walk from there to the terminal, and then get through security and to the gate. We only had carry-ons, and definitely could have arrived at least 30 minutes later and still had plenty of time. Security at Nashville Airport looked crowded that morning, but they have a very large and pretty well-designed security checkpoint, which made the process easy for those with and without PreCheck in our group. Those of us who have PreCheck were through in less than 5 minutes, and the regular security line took no more than 10 minutes.I was surprised by how many flights were leaving from BNA in the 5:30 am-7:00 am timeframe, so the terminal was pretty bustling even so early in the morning. American’s gates are all on the C Concourse, which is under a bit of construction right now, but is otherwise a very standard airport terminal. Our gate (C15) was a really small gate with limited seating, but the gate across from it wasn’t in use and had tons of seating, so we had plenty of space to wait over there. As our scheduled boarding time approached, the gate agent began making the standard announcements about how the boarding process would proceed and offering to gate check carry-ons, since the flight would be completely full. Boarding began a few minutes early, was generally well-executed and civilized, and the employees at the gate were friendly. We boarded toward the beginning of Group 5, and had absolutely no problem finding overhead bin space. We had also paid for upgraded seats in the exit row and were glad we had. We had a really significant amount of extra legroom that was well worth the upgrade. The Airbus A320 didn’t have any amenities to offer, with no seatback TVs or outlets, but it was totally fine, and the aircraft was clean. Wifi was available on the flight, with several things offered for free, including a variety of movies, tv shows, and Apple Music to stream. I also used the AA app to track our flight and arrival time. Boarding proceeded with no issues, and the crew just generally seemed nice, professional, and helpful in preparing the cabin for departure. We left the gate a couple minutes early, but just pushed back and sat there for a while before moving toward the runway. Once we started moving, a bunch of planes were in line to takeoff, but we went to a different runway and took off without any wait at all, which was nice after just sitting for a while near the gate. The pilot also made a few announcements before we departed with helpful information about the flight, and he seemed pleasant and nice, in the same vein as the flight attendants. Shortly after we reached our cruising altitude, flight attendants came around with the drink cart, offering full cans of soda, or juice, water or coffee, in addition to Biscoff cookies.The flight was otherwise totally uneventful, and we landed in Philadelphia right on time and quickly taxied to our gate in Terminal C.  Even though the flight crew didn’t make any announcements asking passengers to do this, I really liked that basically no one jumped up in the aisle the second the seatbelt sign was turned off. Miraculously, virtually everyone just sat in their seats until it was their row’s turn to get up, which was a nice surprise.Overall, this flight from Nashville to Philadelphia was good. We had a nice amount of space in the exit row, and we thought the service was surprisingly friendly and professional from start to finish. It was an uneventful and on-time flight, so we had no complaints.","{'neg': 0.034, 'neu': 0.819, 'pos': 0.147, 'compound': 0.998}",0.998
0.9981,2020-11-01,2020-11-01,20.0,Frustrating Delayed Flight,"Southwest Airlines Flight 1204PDX-DEN6:15-9:40 am Boeing 737-800On a recent trip home from Portland to Philadelphia, our first flight of the day on Southwest from Portland to Denver was a frustrating, stressful experience when it felt like it didn’t need to be. When we arrived at PDX for our flight a little after 5:00 am, the Southwest check-in counters were quite busy, but there was an open kiosk that allowed us to immediately self-tag our bags. When we went to the bag-drop counter to drop-off our bags, the employee weighed my bag first, which came in at exactly 49.00 pounds, before weighing my wife’s suitcase, which came in just slightly above the 50-pound limit at 51.2 pounds. After noting that the one bag was overweight, she first suggested we weigh them together, and said that if they came in under 100 pounds combined, we were fine. As expected based on the initial weight, when the bags were weighed together, they came in at a combined 100.2 pounds, literally 0.2 pounds over the 100 pound limit. In my opinion, the employee was rude and just generally unreasonable, and insisted that we either pay $75 for being overweight, or get out of line and reorganize our luggage. We opted to reorganize our luggage, and very easily got them both under 50 pounds. However, the whole thing just made me angry. I totally understand that 50 pounds is technically the weight limit for each individual bag. However, Southwest also allows two checked bags per person that can be 50 pounds each, and we were only checking one each. Moreover, I’ve flown on multiple other airlines that routinely allow a pound or two over the official limit without issue. We were talking about such a minor overage in weight that the whole thing just felt silly, particularly so early in the morning. After dealing with the luggage, we were quickly through security using Precheck and off to our gate in the new Concourse E. We haven’t been to Portland previously, but I did notice that this new concourse had a lot more open space and seating at each gate than you usually find, which was great. They also seem to be working on adding a variety of new and interesting food options. Southwest uses gates that are pretty far down the concourse, so you can expect a decent walk from security to the gate at PDX.Shortly after we arrived at the gate, the gate agent announced that boarding was about to begin, and due to Covid, the normal lining up by boarding number would not occur. Instead, they would just call 5 boarding numbers at a time to proceed directly to the gate for boarding. I actually thought this was generally easier than forcing everyone to line up by number and cram in with their luggage between the marked poles in the boarding area. I’d prefer if it just stayed this way even after the pandemic.About a quarter of the way through the boarding process, I saw one of the pilots come off of the plane and say something to the gate agent about maintenance, which immediately led the gate agent to place a phone call and stop the boarding process. Shortly after that, he announced that there was a maintenance issue with the lights on the plane, which would require a very short 5-10 minute repair, which had to be fixed before we could leave. However, the problem was that their maintenance contractor was busy on another job for another airline, and that they wouldn’t be able to get to us for at least 60-90 minutes. At that point, everyone who had already gotten onto the plane de-boarded. Although I really appreciated the detailed information from the gate agent, it was extremely frustrating to find out that Southwest does not have any of its own maintenance staff at PDX, and that we would have to wait potentially 90 minutes for a very minor repair. This seemed like something that Southwest could have been better prepared for, and it was very frustrating to have gotten up so early for a flight, only to find out that the airline didn’t have the capacity to take care of a minor issue in a timely manner.The gate agent was very nice and had a good way of keeping people calm despite the frustration of the delay, which could easily have caused many passengers to miss connections in Denver. He told everyone not to rush the desk asking about connections because all re-booking due to missed connections would be handled by a centralized office in Dallas, not by the employees in Portland. He said that we would be called up individually to get new itineraries and boarding passes if the Dallas team determined that anyone needed to be rescheduled. Everyone surprisingly listened and pretty much stayed in their seats to await further directions. Looking at our own itinerary, things weren’t looking good, since the delay, which projected to be 1 hour and 45 minutes, would make our connection in Denver only 10 minutes long. It seemed unlikely we’d be able to get off the aircraft and make it across the terminal before the gate closed on our next flight, but the gate agent did say that the staff in Denver would be instructed to hold flights when possible. This made me feel better, although I wasn’t totally sure if I believed it. Once things had settled down at the gate and the process of waiting for maintenance to arrive began, the gate agent encouraged us to walk around and get food in the airport if we wanted to pass the time. We walked back down the concourse toward the security checkpoint and picked up some breakfast, and while we were there, I heard an overhead announcement instructing everyone to proceed back to the gate for boarding on the Southwest flight to Denver. Not very much time had passed since the initial delay announcement, so I was surprised, but happy, to hear this announcement. It seemed that the repair was completed more quickly than anticipated. By the time we got back to the gate, pre-boarding was already starting again.  We had boarding positions A42 and A43 and ended up snagging one of the exit rows where the window seat has no seat in front of it at all, affording amazing legroom. Between that and the fact that Southwest is currently blocking all middle seats, we had great space on this flight. We ended up leaving the gate exactly an hour late, and the flight was totally fine from that point onward. We took off immediately, made up some time in the air, and landed in Denver only about 45 minutes late, much less than the originally anticipated delay, which gave us no trouble making our connecting flight. It seemed that only one group’s connection in Denver was going to be tricky, and the crew announced that their flight was being held at the gate until they got there, which was nice. In-flight service on this flight was also perfectly fine. Southwest is currently only offering cups of water for a beverage, along with their standard snack mix, which works for me. Wifi was available throughout the flight, and features a variety of free movies and tv shows to stream, and you can also sign-on to get access to iMessage and WhatsApp for free using the wifi, which is a nice way to stay connected in the air. I also like that you can see a map of exactly where the plane is throughout the flight using the wifi. The only other amenity that would have been nice to have is an outlet to charge your phone during the flight, which the seats did not offer.Overall, once we got off the ground, this flight itself was totally fine. The seats were comfortable enough with great legroom in the exit row, along with perfectly fine service. All of our frustrations were on the ground in Portland, where we had an unnecessarily rude experience checking bags, and a frustrating delay with lots of uncertainty about when we’d be able to depart. It felt like with proper planning and staffing, the delay could have been prevented, which is not ok when people are up so early in the morning for a flight to a major connecting airport. It all worked out in the end, since we made our connection to Philadelphia without any issues, but we were stressed and frustrated getting to that point.","{'neg': 0.062, 'neu': 0.823, 'pos': 0.115, 'compound': 0.9981}",0.9981
0.9982,2020-06-01,2020-06-01,30.0,Use Caution Amid COVID-19,"With limited flight options and a strong desire to return from San Diego to Indianapolis, I booked a flight on American from SAN with a stop in Phoenix. I was very hesitant and anxious to fly American during (and before) COVID-19, and a number of my anxieties proved quite valid (particularly during the SAN-PHX flight). Unlike carriers Delta and Alaska, American needs to ensure maximum profits by filling as many seats as possible, regardless of COVID circumstances. My flight to Phoenix was 98% full. While not every single seat was full, only 2 or 3 were. Which is just unacceptable. I felt very annoyed and worried, as this is not just a disturbance because passengers take up space or act annoying—this is because health is at risk. Masks may help (and I personally expect everyone to wear them at all times in public), but I feel safe on Delta and Alaska because they go the extra mile by spacing; restricting; and ensuring the sparseness of every flight they operate. This is simply not the case on American (*at least on the flights I took*). Now that leads me to the service and staff: the flight attendants on both flights were very friendly, welcoming, and generally attentive to passengers’ needs. I particularly commend one FA on SAN-PHX for working to move me to a slightly better seat (at least no one directly next to me). Still uncomfortable, but better than the squished place I sat earlier on. The gate agents at PHX, one woman in particular, seemed to enjoy their jobs so much and provided the most excellent service. Well-done to them and all the other friendly faces!! I’m impressed!!In summary, while there were friendly employees and the flights were on-time, I still would not personally book American again unless they are the only carrier (that was the case here). Please, please exercise caution when you fly, and only fly if you take the appropriate precautions and are not sick. Public health depends on us as individuals. Try to negotiate with gate agents to find a better seat if the flight is fuller than ideal in these conditions, and don’t be afraid to respectfully voice your concerns. I feel that most employees will understand and exhibit care and understanding, as was what I experienced on my trip. Stay healthy, safe, and well! Thanks for getting me to IND on time and with a great personality, American!","{'neg': 0.046, 'neu': 0.727, 'pos': 0.227, 'compound': 0.9982}",0.9982
0.9984,2021-03-01,2021-03-01,30.0,Pretty standard AA flight with a frustrating arrival/baggage claim experience,"American Airlines Flight 1045SFO-PHL11:28 am-7:55 pm Airbus A321S My wife and I recently took a flight to return home to Philadelphia from San Francisco, and it was generally fine. We were glad to have a lot of space in exit row seats that we had purchased, but a rude/pushy flight attendant and a frustrating arrival process at PHL ended things on a somewhat sour note.When we arrived at the new Harvey Milk Terminal at San Francisco Airport to check our bags, I was surprised at how crowded the American Airlines check-in area was, and that it wasn’t particularly well designed for being in a brand new, spacious terminal. There were a good number of the self-service kiosks to check-in, and we were able to get one without waiting, but once you finished printing and self-tagging your bags, the setup was awkward. The way things are set-up, it appears that you should proceed directly with your bag to one of the employees just beyond the kiosks who will check your ID and drop your bag onto the conveyer belt (a common setup at other airports). If this isn’t how it works, there should be a clearly marked line to join for dropping off bags. However, when we (just like a lot of others before us) walked up to the desk thinking we were next to drop our bags, we were informed that we had to instead backtrack to a long makeshift bag drop line snaking across the check-in area that we hadn’t seen off to the side. It didn’t take all that long to get through this line, but the current setup isn’t good for handling the number of people there and it isn’t well organized. The staff at the check-in area was pleasant though, so that was a positive.Security was pretty busy that morning, but the wait for the PreCheck line was relatively quick-moving. The security checkpoint at this new terminal at SFO is set up in a way that should help move people through quickly, with bins available so that multiple people can load their things at once. However, this also makes it a bit confusing once you get through security, since several people’s bins get mixed together. A little more searching for your things is required than the usual setup where only one person is loading their items onto the conveyor belt at a time.As we had seen when we arrived at SFO a few days prior, the Harvey Milk Terminal is very nice. It’s brand new and well designed. There is much more ample seating by each gate than in the average terminal, and the overall vibe is more relaxing and comfortable than you normally see. The gate still got crowded when boarding began, but it was a bit more spacious than usual. Boarding began a few minutes early, and definitely was not the most organized boarding process. The gate agents didn’t do a good job of only boarding one group at a time or giving any breathing room between groups so that things don’t get so clogged at the gate. The machine to scan boarding passes also wasn’t working correctly at the time, so virtually everyone had to scan their boarding pass multiple times before it would register, which wasted time.After having chosen seats poorly on this same type of aircraft on our flight to San Francisco, we made sure to get better seats this time, and paid for Main Cabin Extra seats in the exit row toward the back of the aircraft. We loved that we were able to get one of the only rows on the plane that contained two seats rather than three, and we had a ton of legroom in front of us, which was a great benefit on a transcontinental flight. The only negatives of these seats were that there weren’t any normal windows to look out of (just a tiny window on the exit door that was only open during takeoff and landing), and that the seats were directly behind the mid-cabin bathroom. Being near the bathroom is convenient, but it also means that people waiting for the bathroom come into your space, and a lot of people on this flight didn’t bother to close the bathroom door after using the bathroom, which was frustrating.It was nice that our seats had a variety of amenities, including individual TVs and outlets for charging devices. Wifi was also available on the flight, with several items offered for free, including a variety of movies, tv shows, and Apple Music to stream, all in addition to what was loaded on the TVs.  We’re much more used to the legacy-US Airways A321 that is bare bones, so it is always nice to be on one of the legacy-AA ones that are better equipped.Boarding was also a bit of a mess, since it was a completely full flight where overhead bin space was at a premium. It didn’t help that a couple rows behind us, a couple of older passengers took seats that weren’t theirs and were refusing to get up and move to their correct seats. When the flight attendants tried to mediate the issue, the couple tried to act as if they couldn’t find their boarding passes to locate their correct seats, and basically just wanted the other people assigned to those seats to deal with it. However, the others had paid for those seats, and specifically paid for an aisle seat that they wanted to still have. It took quite a while trying to resolve this, and it wasn’t resolved by the time the aircraft was ready to push back, so the flight attendants vowed to fix it as soon as we were airborne. The couple who took the wrong seats ultimately had to move, rightfully so.The mix of flight attendants on this flight was a little odd. There was one who sat right near us for takeoff and landing, and she was younger. She seemed to generally just be nice and sweet, wanting to make people happy and have a good flight. However, one of the others, who was clearly a more senior flight attendant, was really pushy and a bit rude throughout the flight. During boarding, she was constantly yelling at people and making rude announcements about boarding and stowing carry-on bags, in a way that was beyond the norm. She was also just loud about the fact that she wanted to make sure we left the gate early so she could get to Philadelphia early and make it onto another flight she was trying to catch. I totally understand that desire, and I definitely wanted to get to PHL as soon as possible too, but yelling at passengers for this reason is odd. She was also just generally rude during drink service and another time bothered me in the middle of watching something on my iPad to find out why I was using my own device to watch TV, instead of using the personal TV on the plane. It was an odd thing to make me pull out my headphones to ask. She was just way too pushy.Shortly into the flight, the flight attendants came around to provide drink service and Biscoff cookies. Full drink service was offered, with the exception of alcohol, which was not available in economy. The flight attendants did come around one or two more times after that to offer just water if anyone wanted it, which was nice.There was bad weather in Philadelphia that night, so the pilot told us as we approached PHL that we were going to have to go into a holding pattern to wait for some thunderstorms to pass. Luckily, we only ended up in that holding pattern for about 15 minutes before being released to complete our final approach, and I appreciated that the pilot continued to give us updates throughout that process. We ultimately still arrived at the gate in Philadelphia 10 minutes early, even with the extra time holding.Arrival was a bit frustrating, starting with the fact that we arrived at Gate A24, at the absolutely farthest possible end of Terminal A-West (typically used for international flights in the past). That gate is just a really far walk from anywhere else in the airport, and both the flight attendant announcement on the plane and the AA app said that baggage claim would be in Terminal A at Carousel 2. Once we finally had made our way to an exit from Terminal A, which was a good walk, the exit was closed with a sign saying to go to Terminal B to exit. After walking even further to Terminal B, we were finally able to exit the airport, which took us to the Terminal B/C baggage claim. It was a good 20-25 minute walk from our gate to baggage claim, even at a brisk pace. We could not have arrived at a less convenient gate, which seemed like poor planning because the airport was not at capacity that night.Once we got to the Terminal B/C baggage claim, we realized that the previously specified baggage claim information didn’t make sense. There was no carousel 2 at this baggage claim, since the carousels were all marked with letters. Our flight was also not listed on any of the arrival TV monitors, so we couldn’t check to see if the baggage carousel had been changed. Most people from our flight just started waiting by the second carousel (assuming that would be equivalent to #2), but only bags for other flights were coming out after a good bit of time had passed. Looking at the app, I saw that the baggage tracking feature showed that our bags were on the carousel, we just had to figure out where.I thought maybe we actually had to go outside and walk to the Terminal A baggage claim that was originally specified for our flight. After trekking over to Terminal A outside in the rain, we found that Terminal A baggage claim was totally closed with the building locked and dark, so that was definitely not correct. We walked back over to Terminal B/C, and I was about to go to the baggage office to find out what was going on, when I happened to see our bags already on one of the other carousels. As we finally walked out with our bags, I finally heard them make an announcement that bags for the flight from San Francisco had been moved to a new carousel, but it was very frustrating that this had not been addressed much sooner, either by providing correct information on the app, the monitors in the airport, or earlier announcements. We wasted a ton of time just trying to find our luggage after a long flight, and I blame that on poor communication and organization by AA.Overall, this flight from San Francisco to Philadelphia was fine, given that we had great exit row seats, and we arrived on time. However, rude service from one flight attendant in particular and a hugely frustrating arrival at PHL made the experience more negative than it needed to be.","{'neg': 0.052, 'neu': 0.849, 'pos': 0.098, 'compound': 0.9984}",0.9984
0.9987,2022-02-01,2022-02-01,20.0,"American saved our travel day after a missed connection, but their delayed luggage delivery after that was a total mess","American Airlines Flight 1397ORD-PHL	8:20 pm-11:19 pm Boeing 737-800My wife and I recently took this flight from Chicago to Philadelphia on our way home from Aspen after missing a connection in Chicago on United. United’s delay caused us to be late arriving at O’Hare, so they put us on this later flight on American instead to get home. Simply for the fact that American still had another flight available to Philadelphia that night, which enabled us to get home without spending a night in Chicago, we were very happy with American. It didn’t hurt that the plane was very empty with a nice crew and an on-time arrival. However, the experience we had in getting our delayed luggage back after that spanned for days and showed true incompetence from the airline’s baggage services team.We had arrived at O’Hare on the far end of Terminal 1 in the B Concourse where United’s flights arrive, so we had a good 20-minute walk to get to this flight, which was departing from Terminal 3 in the K Concourse where American is located at O’Hare. It was an easy enough walk, just long, and it’s highly unusual to be connecting between those terminals anyway. It would be rare to have a scheduled connection between United and American. We were surprised to find that virtually everything in the airport seemed closed or in the process of closing at that point, around 7:30 pm. It didn’t seem all that late, but you would have thought it was much later based on the airport’s concessions. We were very hungry and wanted to pick up something to eat, but really couldn’t find anything other than McDonald’s or a couple full sit-down restaurants that we didn’t have time for.When we got to the gate, we had to stop to see the gate agent, since United hadn’t given us boarding passes for this flight, and my AA app was showing the flight, but not giving the usual option to collect mobile boarding passes. The gate agent was very friendly and helpful (a nice surprise based on what we’re used to from the AA staff at Philadelphia Airport in particular), and we were ready to go. The flight boarded right on time, and since it wasn’t a full flight, the boarding process was pretty civilized and quick. We boarded in one of the last groups and had absolutely no problem finding overhead bin space.We were sitting toward the back of the plane and had a full row to ourselves, which was nice. One of the flight attendants also came around and encouraged people to spread out once the boarding door was closed, just as long as we didn’t take the paid exit row seats. The young group flight attendants on this flight just seemed very nice and professional the entire time, and I would loved to have flown on a longer flight with them as our crew.The aircraft was a Boeing 737-800, which is one of the AA aircraft that’s become very standardized over the past few years, so it was exactly what I expected from past flights. The plane was in decent condition, and standard legroom feels somewhat tight, but isn’t horrible either. I do appreciate having both full outlets and USB plugs for easy charging during the flight, and the little electronic device stand at the top of the seat comes in handy as well. Even though we had boarded very quickly and were basically ready to go at least 15 minutes before our scheduled departure time, we just sat there for a while and ultimately pushed back from the gate a couple minutes late. Our taxi to the runway also seemed a bit slow, but once we joined the line to take off, which was about 10 planes deep, we actually got in the air pretty quickly. I’ve always appreciated that O’Hare seems to be an airport that can generally handle volume and keeps things moving. Wifi was available on the flight, with several things offered for free, including a variety of movies, tv shows, and Apple Music to stream. I also used the AA app to track our flight and the time until arrival.There was beverage service early-on in the flight along with Biscoff cookies, and the flight was uneventful after that. It was smooth, with a bit of turbulence as we neared Philadelphia. We ultimately arrived at our gate in Philly about 5 minutes early, which was good. From there, we knew we were going to be in for some further headaches, as United had told us our checked luggage would not be transferred onto this flight in time and would likely make it to Philadelphia on a flight the next day. However, since American was the final carrier on our itinerary, American was going to the be the airline responsible for getting us the luggage, not United.I went straight to the baggage office at the Terminal B/C baggage claim, joining the line after 3 or 4 other people. My wife waited at the baggage carousel to confirm that our bags had not made it on this flight (they hadn’t). There were several other people on our flight who had been in the exact same situation with the missed connection from Aspen, so we all joined the line together to make our delayed baggage claims. It didn’t take too long to make it to the front. The employee who was working that night was actually pretty pleasant and seemed to want to be helpful. It took a while to explain to him what had happened, and why we were making a claim with American despite having baggage receipts from United, but he ultimately understood and confirmed that American would be the one to return the bags to us. It’s still unclear when/how United and American made the handoff of the luggage, but it happened at some point. After I submitted the claim and described our bags, the employee told me that we should expect the bags to arrive within 24 hours and that they’d be delivered directly to our house. I did also get an email from American shortly after that, which provided our case number and a link to a delayed baggage status website. At this point, I really wasn’t frustrated with American at all, since United was the airline that had messed up and American was just picking up the pieces at the end.Luckily, this had happened on our way home, so we went home that night and still had clothes and most of the toiletries we needed. We waited to see what would happen the next day.  That next afternoon, the baggage status tracker was updated to reflect that our luggage had made it to the Philadelphia Airport. A couple hours later, I received an email from the baggage delivery service company, which offered a separate tracker for the actual delivery to our home, and gave an option to pre-sign for your bags so they wouldn’t require a signature to drop them off. It gave an estimate that our bags would leave the airport by 5:30 pm that evening and arrive at our home by 11:30 pm, which sounded fine. However, the tracker never updated further to reflect our bags having left the airport, and we did not receive them that night. Early the following morning, we got another email saying that they actually had left the airport that morning, and there was a map where we could actually see where the driver was. About 45 minutes later, I got an email saying that they had been delivered. I went right outside to find them, only to find a new headache.My wife and I each had one missing suitcase, and they are matching gray and tan hard-sided suitcases. The two suitcases we received were my wife’s, and then a stranger’s soft-sided purple suitcase, nothing even remotely close to mine, not to mention the fact that it was very clearly labeled with its owner’s name and address. Since the person dropping off the luggage had already left, I didn’t know what to do to get my suitcase. I hadn’t been given a direct phone number for the American baggage office at PHL, so my only real option was to call general American Airlines customer service, and after waiting on hold for a long time, the person I spoke to was nice, but really couldn’t do much. She claimed that the baggage staff at general AA customer service has no direct contact with the airport baggage offices that coordinate the actual baggage delivery, so the best she could do was send an internal message to PHL asking them to find and deliver my bag and come back to our house to pick up the wrong one. She told me I should get a call back from the airport with more information later that morning. Beyond continuing to not have my bag or any real resolution, there was extra frustration and complication because their system was showing my baggage claim as completed now, but I was actually worse off than at the start, now having someone else’s bag and no idea if mine was still sitting at the airport or also delivered to the wrong place.    In the meantime, I called the person whose bag I did have to let them know about their luggage. They lived about an hour away from me, and I offered to either meet them halfway to give them their bag or have AA pick it up and re-deliver to them based on my phone call with customer service. They were really nice and eager to have their bag back and not in AA’s hands (which I definitely don’t blame them for!), so they actually came all the way to my house to get it later that morning. I was glad that someone was reunited with their bag, even if it wasn’t me yet!Later that afternoon, I still had not received a call about my bag and was getting increasingly irritated about the incompetence. I called AA customer service again to inquire, and was basically told the same thing as in the morning: my bag was probably still sitting at the airport and the wrong one had been loaded for delivery (but they couldn’t know for sure), and they could put in another message to the PHL baggage office. I guess the second message did finally do the trick, since I got a call from the PHL baggage office about an hour later to inquire about what my bag looked like and confirm all of my information. The staff member on the phone said she was pretty sure my bag was still sitting there at the airport, and that they’d arrange to have it re-delivered that night. This all probably would have been easier if I had just gone back to the airport to pick up our bags as soon as they made it there, but I shouldn’t have had to do that when it was the airlines’ fault our baggage didn’t make it with us in the first place. However, going forward, if I’m able, I would consider trying to intercept delayed bags by going to the airport to get them before they can get mixed up in the incompetence of the delivery service.The airport must have found my bag shortly after that, because I got another delivery email that night, saying that my bag would be leaving the airport by 5:30 pm and arriving by 11:30 pm at our house (the same email and time frames from the email the night before which hadn’t materialized as promised). However, around 6:00 pm, I got another email saying that the bag was actually out for delivery, and I watched the tracking throughout the evening as the driver went truly all over New Jersey dropping off bags. Mine did not arrive by 11:30 pm, and I woke up in the morning to find out that it had been dropped off at 3:15 am. All I cared about was that it was actually there and was the correct bag, which it finally was.Overall, our flight itself from Chicago to Philadelphia on American was very good. The flight itself was comfortable with a pleasant crew, and was our best way home after United caused us to miss a connection and didn’t have any flights of their own for us that night. American’s more robust schedule to Philadelphia was great. However, once we got home, dealing with our delayed baggage was a mess. United was the reason the bags were delayed, so I don’t blame the initial delay on American. However, once the bags were in American’s hands and became their responsibility to deliver, they took longer to get to us than they should have, including sending us a completely wrong bag, which caused me to have to spend an entire day on the phone with AA trying to figure it out. I’m glad I still got my bag back, even if it was two days later than I should have, but I’m not sure I ever would have gotten it back had I not followed up so much and made them pay attention to it. This experience would be an A for the flight itself, but an F for delayed baggage handling.","{'neg': 0.054, 'neu': 0.852, 'pos': 0.094, 'compound': 0.9987}",0.9987
0.9988,2021-11-01,2021-11-01,40.0,Good Experience on Southwest,"Southwest Airlines Flight 1941PHL-BNA6:00 am-7:10 am Boeing 737-700I recently took this flight from Philadelphia to Nashville at the start of a weekend trip, and found it to be a generally smooth, positive experience on Southwest. The only negative was that we were a bit delayed getting into Nashville due to having to de-ice in Philly, but it was outside of the control of the airline, and they handled it as best as they could.We arrived at PHL around 4:45 am for our 6:00 am flight, which was plenty of time since we were traveling with only carry-ons. We parked in the parking garage attached to the airport, which was quite crowded and somewhat difficult to find a spot in. This has become the norm at PHL since they never re-opened the economy lot after closing it at the start of the pandemic. However, less than five minutes of circling around was enough to find a spot on the 1st level, which is ideal for departures, since you can walk directly across to the security checkpoint from the garage. I would recommend trying higher floors of the garage right off the bat if hoping to find a spot more quickly.There are always a lot of flights to leisure destinations departing first thing in the morning from Terminal E where Southwest operates from, and that day was no exception. The shared Terminal D/E security checkpoint, which is pretty large, was crowded. Half of our group has PreCheck, while the other half had to use the regular security line, and both had a wait. The PreCheck line was less than 5 minutes long and we were through quickly. The regular line was much longer, and probably required 15-20 minutes to get through that morning. Southwest’s gates at PHL are all at the very end of Terminal E, so there is a bit of a walk to get to your gate after security as well. We made it the gate with about 15 minutes to go before the scheduled 5:30 am boarding. We had boarding positions A54-A58, which we had gotten when checking in for the flight at exactly the 24-hour mark. Boarding started right on time, and we were on the aircraft quickly to find seats. One of the only things we dislike about Southwest is not having an assigned seat, even though we almost always have good boarding positions and have never had an issue finding seats together. It just adds a little bit of stress that isn’t present on other airlines. However, it does seem to speed up boarding, since everyone is eager to get on ASAP and figure out where they’ll be seated. By the time we boarded, most of the rows ahead of the exit row were starting to fill up, but there were tons of options further back. We ended up with a really ideal spot for our group of five, in the one exit row where there is a row of only two seats in front of a row of three, where the window seat in the second row has the best legroom on the plane. We grabbed those five seats and settled in. Even though all five seats were considered exit row, only the two-seater and the window seat behind it seemed to have extra legroom.In-flight service on this flight was good, and I thought the flight attendants were friendly and attentive. Their announcements were pleasant with a little bit of humor mixed in, but nothing over-the-top or annoying. We departed the gate right on time, and they made an announcement to let us know that the plane required de-icing, so that would delay our takeoff. I was surprised to hear that we had to de-ice in early November, but I guess it had gotten below freezing overnight and there had been some precipitation. It was a little frustrating since I could see that not all planes had to de-ice, so we just seemed to get unlucky that day. The de-icing pad is on the exact opposite side of the airport from Terminal E, so it took about 10 minutes to taxi down there. Once there, we parked next to two other planes that were about to be de-iced, and luckily the de-icing did start within a couple minutes. The pilot said that only the wings needed to be de-iced, which would save us some time as compared to having to do the full aircraft. I think they were a bit optimistic in telling us it would take only a “few minutes” to de-ice, since it was over 20 minutes, but it didn’t take nearly as long as we’ve had on some previous flights in Philadelphia. After that, we had to taxi all the back to the opposite end of the airport to take off, but I appreciated that it felt like we taxied down there at a really good clip to help make up for the delay, and we took off immediately when we made it to the runway.Wifi was available throughout the flight, and features a variety of free movies and tv shows to stream, and you can also sign-on to get access to iMessage and Whatsapp for free using the wifi. I also like that you can see a map of exactly where the plane is throughout the flight using the wifi. The only other amenity that would have been helpful to have is an outlet to charge your phone during the flight, which was not offered.Beverages were offered a little bit into the flight, with an easy-to-read menu on the cards in the seatback pockets to make choices. I always find it interesting how Southwest takes drink orders without using a drink cart, prepares the drinks in the galley, and brings them back on trays. That form of service actually is surprisingly efficient, and it actually makes the service feel a bit nicer and more personal than when it’s coming from a drink cart. There’s also the benefit of the aisles not being clogged with drink carts at any point. We were served our drinks quickly along with their standard snack mix, which is similar to Chex Mix. I really had no complaints about the flight itself, other than the fact that the delay due to de-icing ultimately got us into Nashville a bit late. We arrived at our gate 20 minutes late, which wasn’t a big deal for us, but could be stressful for others who had short connections in Nashville. It was nice that the flight attendants starting announcing the gates for the connecting flights shortly before we arrived, and they also let people on some of the tightest connections know that the ground staff said that those flights would be held for the incoming Philly passengers to get there in time. As we taxied to the gate, they also made an announcement asking passengers who didn’t have a tight connection to stay seated so that passengers with tight connections could get off first. Most passengers seemed to follow this, although the number of people who jumped off right away seemed a little large for all of them to have tight connections.  Overall, we had no real complaints about this flight and thought Southwest did a good job and offered good service. I’m sure we’ll be back on another Southwest flight sometime in the near future and I won’t mind at all.","{'neg': 0.037, 'neu': 0.847, 'pos': 0.116, 'compound': 0.9988}",0.9988
0.9995,2021-11-01,2021-11-01,40.0,American Airlines/Iberia,"Review of Trip to Spain11/19-26Let me preface my remarks that we are a septuagenarian couple who have traveled extensively to Europe for over 30 years.  This trip was our high school senior grandson’s which allows us a week of one-on-one time with him. We booked our trip through Costco Travel; our first time to do so.  The trip included flights to Madrid, Spain, a high speed train to Barcelona, and the flight back to the US with hotel and transfer to and from the airport.  In addition via Tripadvisor/Viator we booked some excursions: HoponHopoff bus in Madrid and Avila and Segopvia, the Prada Museum and Royal Palace; and Montserrat and Sagrada Familia in Barcelona. We flew with American Airlines to JFK in New York and there via American Airlines we flew Iberia Airlines to Madrid.  We typically fly Premium Economy on the long flights to allow us to sleep on the way over.  However, due to an error on both our parts, we only received upgraded economy which is only a little more leg room.  Uncomfortable seating, etc.  For those who fly you know the drill.  Our Iberia departure was a 1 hour delay with a half-hour delayed arrival.  Nothing unusual but remember we booked hotel transfers.  After we arrived we waited about 45 minutes for our luggage to find our luggage was lost!  We asked and was guided to the Iberia customer service center and arrived to a relatively short line.   There were about 4 agents handling the customers. I was concerned about our driver so I went to make sure he was there and explained our luggage was lost and I had to fill our the forms, etc.  My wife and grandson stayed with him while I returned to Iberia customer service.  It took me an HOUR to get to the customer service representative and another half hour to fill out the paperwork.  I explained that our cold weather clothes were in our suitcases and we would need to purchase some clothing, etc.  To my dismay he gave me a print out with a telephone number to call...TOMORROW!  That they would not provide any vouchers, etc until tomorrow!!  Perhaps customer service but certainly NOT customer care.  In addition our driver demanded 60 euros cash for his time. Uuggh.  So instead off getting on the HOHO bus we trotted to stores to get coats, hats, toiletries, etc.  It was so late by then the museums, etc were closing and the HOHO bus stopped at 6 pm. We stayed at the NH Collection Suecia in Madrid.  It was very nice, great location,  and the staff very helpful and helped direct us to some stores to buy clothes, etc.  While we speak a little Spanish (Our grandson had taken 3 years of Spanish and was a great help) we certainly are not fluent.  I called the number given me by Iberia customer service to see if there were any updates.  I had received a text message that they had located our luggage and it was being sent to the airport.  Where it went before we never found out.   I called the number and listened to a Spanish recording, but it was so fast I couldn’t understand nor could our grandson.  I was listening for an English option but there was none.  Regardless, we felt our luggage would arrive the next day; little did we know it would not. The next morning we went to catch the HOHO bus near the hotel.  We waited, and waited some more.  No bus.  We finally decided to walk, in the cold to the Prada. It is a great museum; overwhelming in fact.   You can not go wrong going there but plan for a lot of time.  We could have easily spent the whole day there and still not have seen it all. We then went to the HOHO stop right beside the Prada.  We waited and waited some more. No bus. We even asked several personnel near the museum and they all said that is where it stops.  I noticed a HOHO bus stop near by but never made it to our stop.  So we trekked over to that stop and waited and waited some more.  FYI, we learned that they had changed their schedule but never notified us nor did they post any signs at the stops. Even the kiosks which sell the HOHO tickets didn’t know!!  Anyway, while we have always used the HOHO to get around cities, etc. these were worthless.  They even stopped the buses going to some of the major attractions in Madrid such as the Royal Palace!  A total waste of TIME and money.  The time was the greatest loss. We did use the HOHO bus to get near the Royal Palace but that was the only time.  We never even toured the whole route.The Royal Palace is fabulous and again well worth a visit. Don’t miss the armory though; it too is fabulous.  Although you can’t take pictures in most of the Palace they have a great book in the store, Royal Palace of Madrid.  It is well worth purchasing.  It is at the Royal Palace HOHO stop that we found out(after about 30 minutes) they had eliminated several stops including this one.  ???unbelievable. So we used Uber and taxis the rest of our stay. They were quick to respond and relatively inexpensive, certainly not as inexpensive as the HOHO bus or public transportation.  Note: we often use public transportation when we travel but with such a short time we wanted to maximize our time and waiting for buses or metros was considered to time consuming.  In hindsight we would have been better off to use it.After the Palace we returned to our hotel with the expectation our luggage would be there. It wasn’t.  I asked the concierge to call for me and ask where our luggage was and about reimbursement for our clothes, etc.  He was able to determine that our luggage was in Madrid and would probably arrive that evening; but nothing on the reimbursement.  Note that we had received no such information via text from Iberia.  So we went to dinner and had a nice evening.  Getting back to the hotel we found...no luggage.  This proved to be very problematic as we had no time to go buy any additional clothing. The next day we had our excursion to  Ávila and Segovia.  As we traveled by bus we noticed the outside temperature drop from 9 C to 0 C.  When we arrive at Avila it was actually snowing, which normally would be a delight, but with the clothing we had we were freezing, especially my wife.  The tour was great and we highly recommend it.  Our guide was fabulous...am I using that too much? But she was.  We had a great lunch in Avila; I had their famous large bean soup; highly recommended. Afterwards we traveled to Segovia and I decided to give my wife some of my clothing and I stayed behind.  I had some nice cups of tea at a local cafe but I would have rather been on the tour. My wife and grandson did have a wonderful time again.  Again our guide was fabulous.  While I was at the cafe I called the hotel about our luggage and eureka it had arrived!  Since we were leaving the next day for Barcelona it was very important to us.  However, once again nothing about reimbursement from Iberia or any text message that they had delivered our luggage.  Extremely poor customer service and certainly no customer care at all.   The next day we departed the hotel to take the high speed train to Barcelona.  Everything was very easy; easy to get to the station, easy to locate the gate, easy to find our car and seats thanks to the staff.  Ride was very nice with some nice scenery including snow on the ground!  We had lunch on board and just had a very nice trip.  My only complaint is that we wanted to leave early to arrive in Barcelona in time to visit some sites.  As it was we departed at 1 pm and arrived about 4 pm.  By the time we arrived at the hotel the day was pretty lost. We stayed at the NH Collection Podium, again a very nice hotel and location.  The next day we strolled Las Ramblas in the misty rain; but later as we walked the Rambla de Catalunyaand the Gothic Quarter it began to rain hard!  By the time we arrived back at the hotel we were soaked!  Fortunately we had our luggage and was able to change.  We met that evening with a pastor friend and had dinner and attended his church.  It was a great way to spend an evening. The next day we traveled to Montserrat leaving with Explore Catalunya.  Our guide Robert was great or should I say fabulous. They were well organized and allowed us some free time.  If you’ve never been to Montserrat(we actually had) it is really quite incredible.  We took the funicular to the top of the mountain as well as walked to the Cross of Saint Michael.  Afterward we headed to the Sagrada Familia.  It had been several years since we had visited and they have accomplished a lot.  It is due to be completed in 2026.  Again, fabulous.  It is so extraordinary that someone could have such a vision yet alone have it constructed.  Just beautiful and wrought with symbolism.The next day we left to return to the US via American Airlines.  Due to some mixup again we had what they said were premium economy seats but not what I had hoped for.  We managed and the flight was uneventful; customs and passport control were easy(we have GOES). Our luggage had arrived –eureka and was easily rechecked to our home destination.  Our only complaint was the 7 hour layover in Miami.  But even after booking I looked for options and there really were none. All in all, a week with our grandson was priceless and worth any aggravations that occurred.  I am sure he will remember it all his life --- unfortunately the good and the bad. It will be interesting to see how Iberia and perhaps American Airlines responds as I will copy them on the letter as well.","{'neg': 0.06, 'neu': 0.803, 'pos': 0.137, 'compound': 0.9995}",0.9995
