-0.9986,2020-02-01,2020-02-01,10.0,Abandoned by American Airlines,"Earlier this month my family and I were traveling from Hong Kong to Denver, and I decided to give Premium Economy in American Airlines a try.  I did not expect it to be as good as Cathay's offering, but for a lower price and the extra space of premium I thought it should be manageable, particularly as I am a Oneworld Emerald Member (Diamond on Cathay) and hence I would have some perks such as lounge access.The result was a complete mess of cancellations and delays, and being routed through London to get from HK to Denver (the wrong way around the planet.)  Most importantly, throughout the customer service from AA has been appalling.  I just tried to ring through to speak to someone again and it appears that no one at AA actually speaks to clients with complaints - they will only communicate by e-mail.A quick rundown of what went wrong on this trip:*  AA cancelled its flight at the last moment due to virus concerns.  Despite the announcement in the online press that mainland flights were cancelled but HK flights were still operating, they cancelled the flight late Saturday and did not try to call or e-mail any of their clients.  Our travel agent had been on the phone with them the afternoon before and they had said all was okay.*  Why did they cancel the flight?  Their pilots all called in sick and effectively refused to fly to HK, even though we are more than 1,000km from Wuhan and have fewer cases of the virus than Japan, Singapore, and other destinations AA continued to fly too.*  With the pilots having ducked their responsibilities at the last moment, did AA work to find other flights for their passengers?  No.  Instead, as near as I can tell, they quickly found seats for their pilots and flight crew already in HK to deadhead out, taking up almost all the spare flight capacity.  While the AA pilots were unwilling to fly themselves, pilots from Cathay, BA, and other airlines continued to due their duty and serve their passengers, and the AA team put their staff at the front of this queue.*  So with this situation and our need to get to the US to visit a sick relative, the only solution was for us to go to the US through London, adding extensive flight time and a long layover in London.*  Their first attempt to do this saw them downgrading us to regular economy.  It was not until we pushed that they got us our premium economy seats.*  At this time I asked, for the first of many times, to speak with the HK country head for AA.  I have never been able to speak to a senior manager at AA throughout this mess despite numerous requests, and the ground staff simply say that they can't do anything.*  When returning from the US we were rerouted onto Cathay, but had to do an AA flight from Denver to LA.  However there was a short weather hold and so the flight was delayed and we would miss our connection.  Trying to change this flight took some two hours, again led to them trying to downgrade us, and saw most of the flight miserable and confused.  AA staff were not communicating amongst themselves and they were ridiculously understaffed.  *  We eventually had to take a United Airlines flight from Denver to LA, so of the four sectors we were supposed to take with AA, we had zero flight time with the airline.  *  Now I am back and I have not been credited with any of my points or miles from the flights.  In trying to get this sorted I find that, and I should not be surprised by now, there is no one I can speak to about the problem.I understand the problems happen.  However, in this case the problem is entirely of AA's own making.  Further, having made a series of decisions they need to support their customers.  Instead they abandoned them.  This was our big adventure to see if AA could hold up as an airline choice for us.  They have failed so badly that not only will I actively avoid AA in future, I am going to spread the word of their ridiculously poor customer service.  If they are going to abuse and abandon their customers in this way they should simply close up.  Avoid AA.  American Airline's management should be embarrassed, and their pilots should be ashamed.","{'neg': 0.155, 'neu': 0.818, 'pos': 0.027, 'compound': -0.9986}",-0.9986

Sadly, the airport employees/TSA are shockingly rude and even hostile to varying degrees. This, I find is a mirror-reflection of the Baltimore area in general. Never have I encountered such rude, arrogant, unpleasant people in my life. What is it about Baltimore that just can't help but bring out the worst in people? As I said, the place is as confusing as a maze, so be prepared to spend an hour looking for your car, as the A,B,C,D,E,F,G, etc. parking lot designations don't follow any logical sequence and abruptly end and confuse the heck out of people! I spent almost an hour trying to find my car! When I asked a passing TSA employee for directions, I was given the rudest ""I have no idea""! rebuff I have ever experienced at any airport! To add insult to injury, I became so agitated that I started to experience rising blood pressure and dangerous light-headedness/angina. In all the unpleasantness of this BWI place, I inadvertently dropped my ticket somewhere searching in vain for my car. I then spent another 30 minutes looking for my parking ticket, in vain as well. I only found my car by pure luck, even though I had written down its precise location in the parking lot. It cost me $22 to get out of that BWI hellhole. (I am thinking of another word, not appropriate to use). I got the feeling that if, I had in fact, suddenly collapsed from a heart attack, absolutely no one working there would have done a thing! I am really disgusted by that place! If I could give ZERO stars to BWI airport I would. Sadly, the airport management couldn't care less and the (government) employees are absolutely unaccountable to the public. Awful, awful, awful place! Try to avoid it if you can.","{'neg': 0.293, 'neu': 0.664, 'pos': 0.043, 'compound': -0.9986}",-0.9986

I have had fairly decent experience on Delta Airlines (same seat classification/category) from Beijing to Toronto earlier in the same year:This flight ranks amongst one of the worst International Flights in over fifty years of travelling around the globe. One cannot help but notice how the ""check-in"" counter staff members were so condescending, insolent and arrogant in their attitudes toward paying Customers. Is it simply because this is a flight to Nigeria (Africa)? I wonder!I have never experienced  Airlines employees ""begging"" for money from passengers seating and waiting in the lounge to board a plane onward to Africa! When asked, certain priggish and pompous Delta Airline flight -attendants rudely retorted stating that asking for donations to help ""poor and helpless"" Americans is the norm in USA... Wrong!It is Pitiful to witness how low America has sunk!To worsen the situation, the In-flight service was so disgusting words alone simply cannot do justice. We started off by boarding and ""Old"" dilapidated aircraft with a past-due date, ready to be recycled in the junkyard! The poor quality of food and drinks served on board, defective entertainment units in more than three (3) seat rows within my vicinity (my seat included), dirty washrooms...Just Appalling! Delta Airlines is not treating Nigerians (Africans) Right, and this attitude is Wrong especially at such and altitude!I refuse to ever fly Delta Airlines to Africa, never again...NEVER!!!The catch is in the ""direct flight""...but do not be deceived. You will be ""uncomfortable"" for almost 12 hours while feeling directly in hell up above.PS: I wrote to Delta and only for them to insult my intelligence with 5,000 bonus points as a ""pacifier""...Jokers!","{'neg': 0.228, 'neu': 0.707, 'pos': 0.065, 'compound': -0.9962}",-0.9962
-0.9961,2020-03-01,2020-03-01,30.0,Bathrooms on a plane,"Normally, I love Delta Airlines.... but the three star review is a protest for their use of the Airbus design with the lavatory in the center of the plane.  I understand the inclination... conventional wisdom would dictate that a lavatory in the center the plane would be more convenient for everyone on the flight.  However, that conventional wisdom would ignore the fact that the world is full of jerks.  It would ignore the fact, that there are some people who would go to that convenient lavatory and drop the mother of all duces in the first half hour of a 4 hour flight.Some people hate their fellow man. Some people just want to watch the world burn.  Delta's use of this particular Airbus design allows the worst among us to completely ruin the flight experience of 30 of their fellow passengers with nothing but the stink of their bowels.  You may think I'm overreacting... but I tell you... I literally just experienced the nightmare you are already envisioning. Not 30 minutes into the flight, some traveling fiend with a belly full of what could only be hell itself, absolutely destroyed that humble lavatory...  as the door swung open onto the sealed, pressurized cabin of travelers trapped at standard cruising altitude, the stench could only be described as terror inducing... it literally roused me from an early flight slumber and dragged me into the hell which would be my companion for the rest of the flight...  It would not matter if my tray table was up, or If my seat was in the upright position... I was doomed.  The smell Harassed at least five rows of passengers... While the closest unfortunate bystander had watering eyes and had to fight the urge to use the conveniently located vomit bags in the seat back in front of them.  In short, it was a a single serving package of punishment for those who failed to pay for preferred seating.I write this review having survived the experience.... sitting far enough away from the splash zone of this exhibition of nature and technology run amok, to implore Delta airlines to think about the safety and serenity of their passengers when choosing a design for an airplane.  There are monsters among us who care nothing for their fellow passengers... and one can only hope that the company upon which we place so much collective trust would protect us from those who would seek to harm us.","{'neg': 0.195, 'neu': 0.721, 'pos': 0.084, 'compound': -0.9961}",-0.9961

I get it. You hate me, you hate people, and you hate your job. I have traveled back with students from abroad to be greeted with angry agents who separated my students from me, sending them to separate security checkpoints, and rushed us so fast through lines my kids kept screwing up.

Our trip was wonderful, but our experience traveling through this airport ruined it. From the Fox Rental Car shuttle the bad treatment started, and it just got worse. Nearly every 'service' person we dealt with, from the American Airlines check-in, to the shop assistants, TSA, Burger King lady, and nearly every AA representative we were forced to deal with was breathtakingly rude, and sometimes downright bullying. And my husband and I are very polite and patient people. We spent the night in the freezing airport due to AA incompetence and got nothing but hostility from nearly everyone we (politely) approached for help or information. When we were finally put on a plane with the help of one American Airlines employee, I witnessed at least four other passengers being treated terribly for no reason. It's like they are trained to abuse their clients. The icing on the cake was the 2 AA cabin crew members getting into a very loud fight in the back of the plane. The tension on the plane was palpable. I've never experienced this in my life, and suddenly the news reports about passengers flipping out on planes seemed understandable. I'm not surprised, if it happens on American Airlines, and guess what? It would be totally the fault of those employees. Terrible, shameful treatment of their clients. I will never fly AA again, and will never pass through McCarron airport again. Beware!","{'neg': 0.226, 'neu': 0.719, 'pos': 0.055, 'compound': -0.9951}",-0.9951
-0.9943,2020-01-01,2020-01-01,20.0,Chaos at the Amer Airline passenger gate,"Ice storm so bad in Kansas City that all flights were grounded. My comment is about the total chaos at the American Airlines passenger gate.  At about 7:30am, we boarded the plane, but then were told we had to get off the plane. We waited in the passenger area for the American Airlines staff to tell us what was happening. About 9:30, the women at the passenger gate told us to retrieve our luggage from baggage claim because the flight was cancelled. While I stayed with our carry-on luggage and called American Airlines to reschedule our flight from Kansas City to Dallas Ft. Worth to book the plane to Maui on the next day, my husband went to baggage claim.  The AA representative on the toll-free number said that our flight was NOT cancelled, just delayed. I told her that the women at the gate told us to get our luggage, no flight today. She put me on Hold. My husband returned about 25 minutes later and said that the baggage claim attendants said that no luggage was coming off of our flight; that we should return to the gate and wait for the flight. We returned to the passenger gate for flight 1261 to Dallas and the women told us that no 1261 was leaving that day. I was still talking to the  AA representative on the toll-free number. I asked her if she would tell the women at the gate that no luggage was coming off the plane. But by that time, other passengers returned to tell her she was mistaken. It took another hour before we were told we would be able to depart Kansas City that day. Now I know it was a terrible ice storm. No one is at fault for the delay in flight or the cancelling of flights, but the chaos at the passenger gate was ridiculous. Those women didn't have a clue what was happening. They told the passengers to leave. I know that many did leave out of frustration and not knowing the true circumstances of that flight. The woman on the toll-free number stuck with me. At one time she put me on hold which lasted about 20 minutes, but she returned to assure me that my flight would get out of Kansas City. She helped me get on the plane to Maui for the following day.  American Airlines has fallen greatly in my regard. In the future, I will shop around for a more customer centered airline.","{'neg': 0.14, 'neu': 0.834, 'pos': 0.026, 'compound': -0.9943}",-0.9943
-0.9942,2020-01-01,2020-01-01,10.0,"Terrible service, flight delayed by 6 hours because no backup pilot crew available","Our flight was initially scheduled to be pushed from the gate at 8:12am and arrival at St. Thomas 13:10 local time. Everything was on schedule and around 8:05 doors were closed.First delay happened however right at that moment passenger at 22C decided that he want to leave the plane, doors were re-opened and passenger was let go off the flight, this added probably 10 minutes and I’m not sure if Delta protocol allows this in a first place.We remained at the gate for a while and without any information, finally about 15-20 minutes later pilot informed us that plane will be de-iced and it should be done at the de-icing station. It was a line and another 25 minutes went by. All of a sudden announcement came asking for a doctor. There were at least two on board and they were rushed to the back seats to check on someone and came back telling on the way that ‘everything is ok’. Meanwhile plane was parked on the taxyway with no announcement of what is going on from the crew and everyone on board was getting more and more worried about when we will depart. Another 20 or so minutes later captain told us that we are going back to the gate to disembark two more passengers. Gate was busy and we had to wait again, finally doors were opened and two passengers were escorted off the plane.Waiting again, I’ve received message from Delta that our flight is delayed by another hour and only after that pilot announced that we need more fuel and it will result in another delay. Refueling took another half hour and once it was completed pilot told that now their time is up - pilots crew allowed to work for 9 hours straight and flying to St. Thomas and back would take more.More sitting on the plane waiting for what will happen. One version that was announced - and confirmed by looking at the flight plan on flightaware.com - is that we will fly to Atlanta, pick another crew and then to St. Thomas. Delta app was offering change to the next day flight. After another hour or so wait, pilots left the plane and some time later we were told to leave plane as well, take our belongings and go back to the gate “because plane may need some service”, but no announcement were made about Delta plan on handling the situation. Few Delta managers were discussing situation with each other next to the gate but did not share anything with us. Finally announcement was made to get back to the gate around 1pm, we were let back on the plane and were sitting again, flight attendant told us that new crew still not arrived. It took another 50 minutes to get new pilots onboard and finally we were flying back. No extra food was offered on board after almost six hours delay, it was no real apology from Delta and we were not offered any compensation. Also during the flight condition on the plane deteriorate, all coach class lavatories ran out of water in the toilets and were dirty and to add to all this at the landing plane touched down so hard that some of the luggage compartments doors opened.. this was scary.This chain of delays and absence of clear communication from Delta along with confusing changing plans resulted in inconvenience for everyone on board - see attached hand-written note with names, email addresses and seat numbers from many of the fellow passengers, this letter will be CCd to their emails. On the personal side, our family of 5 missed a day at the island that is expensive on it’s own, were unable to pick up our rental car as our flight landed at Some questions to Delta: - How you can schedule a single pilot crew for the flight to the remote island with no extra backup crew - when total flight time according FlightAware is almost 8 hours, this only allows one hour for the delays and JFK is notoriously known for the ground delays?- Why it was no crew available on call at the major hub? -Why Delta was not keeping up with updating passengers with contingency plan?- Why refuel was needed in a first place, it was no extra fueling at St. Thomas, this mean DL465 takes enough fuel at JFK for the round trip flight to save on the fuel cost at STT?  that basically Delta decided to put full plane of the passengers into the inconvenience instead of paying a bit extra for the fuel at STT. Without refueling crew would still have time to complete  our flight.- Why once we were forced back at the terminal, it was no announcement via SMS or email about Delta plans and also about availability of the food, etc? We found that it was some food distributed at the time we were re-boarding.- Why Delta did not truly apologized for the 6 hours arrival delay and why no compensation was offered to the passengers?","{'neg': 0.081, 'neu': 0.904, 'pos': 0.015, 'compound': -0.9942}",-0.9942
-0.994,2020-01-01,2020-01-01,10.0,Worst airport experience ever !!!!!!!,I had the absolute worst experience ever with South West airlines- Houston. I waited at baggage claim for over 30 minutes for my bag which never came while over the speaker the announcer called for the owner of a crown royal bag. As you may know Crown Royal is a liquor that comes in a purple and gold bag but this couldn’t be my bag even though it was purple and gold it clearly said Betsy Johnson all over it. I guess that was a funny joke for the employees to yell on the loud speaker that owner of a crown royal bag needed to come to the service desk. After realizing my bag was not coming I was directed to a room in the back where I inquired about the location of the bag. The airport staff then said oh you’re the owner of the Crown Royal bag and began to giggle. They informed that my bag fell and was ran over and some of my stuff have been destroyed with not even the smallest hint of remorse. My bag was literally destroyed to the point all the clothes and shoes In it were ripped to shreds/ destroyed. When I became angry the south west employee Danny asked me “ what are you so mad about it’s not like we are not going to cut you a check”. I explained to the worker that I am in a city I have never been to with absolutely nothing to wear and all my belongings destroyed. The employee began to tell me how southwest is a million dollar company & they have no problem cutting a check as if this was suppose to make me feel better. The employee then told me it happens all the time due to southwest handling so much luggage on a daily basis and they just cut a check. The employees asked me to go through my bag and damages and asked me to price the cost of each item. The south west employee sat on the computer googled my items one by one while making comments like “ woah you really paid $200 for that ?” and arguing with me over the amount I paid for each item saying things like “ well they have it for cheaper at this store”. The worker also went as far to turn to his employee and say “I don’t even argue with these people” After the employee calculated what he felt I deserved for my belongings he wrote a check for $620 and told me I should just go to the mall & buy new items. The employee told me I can go to chase bank and cash the check the same day which was a lie. I went to chase bank and they told me they could not cash check because south west had to verify it and no one answered the phone. I was not able to cash check until I returned home from my vacation. The customer was absolutely terrible and this was a major I’m convenience and embarrassing experience.

At 7, we were told that the flight had been canceled. Everyone rushed up to get something rebooked. We had a wedding the next day at 3, so we were desperate to make something work. We were told we could fly to Oakland, CA, spend the night and then fly out the next morning, so that’s what we did. Southwest employees kept repeating that they “can’t control the weather” so they wouldn’t cover the expenses. Like the non refundable hotel we had booked in Chicago or the second hotel we had to get in Oakland. Keep in mind also that most other airlines were still flying to chicago, but whatever maybe the weather was really bad, we had no way of knowing. Coming back is where it gets really bad: tried to check into our 8:30 am flight the night before and got an error saying we should check in at the airport. We didn’t think much of it, we thought maybe it had to do with the flight change. We got to the airport, stood in a long line to talk to someone, and were informed that the flight had been canceled due to “weather” again. This time we were in Chicago and could clearly see how it looked outside - no rain, no thunder, no lightning. No other airlines had canceled. We had also not been informed about this change over email or anything nor had we been rebooked for another flight when the cancelation happened, so there were no other flights for us. We were told to wait til the next morning, fly standby on one of the already packed flights, or spend the rest of the day in layovers. Again, they “can’t control the weather” nor did they take ownership for us not being rebooked earlier. We figured out later that our reservation had been deleted by whoever rebooked us the first time, which is just user error - no “weather” issues there. But they didn’t tell us this of course; gotta blame things on external factors if they want to get away with not paying for our $500+ in extra expenses we’ve had to pay. I ended up having to buy another ticket with a different airline at a different airport for that day to get back to Seattle - which cost a fortune.

Our flight got delayed twice for no reason. I've looked at the weather app radar and there were no storms nor any weather inconveniences on the way. When we were supposed to board according to the second delayed scheduled time, there was no actual airplane at the gate, but 45 minutes later an airplane arrives.It was disembarked and it took another 30 minutes to clean it. After we finally boarded around 7:18 PM, we were told every 15 minutes that we were leaving. However, four announcements later and actually 1 hour something after, the pilot finnaly acknowledged that they were fixing the reverse thruster. Long story short we departed 5 hours after the scheduled departing time and landed 4 hours after the scheduled time.Being in the airport for so many hours till 7:18 PM when we physically boarded, we have encountered additional expenses such as; drinks, snacks and an unplanned early dinner. I also had to cancel the initial SUV scheduled to pick us up in Dallas at 9:45PM and schedule another for 11:30PM, then cancel it again and schedule another for 12:45AM which resulted in two additional charges. Then, I had to pay a pet sitting service 2 extra trips to my house to walk my dogs. This was a total nightmare. Not to mention that my son panicked really bad and wanted out of the airplane after realising that they were repairing the airplane and the pilot kept lying to us. He was extremely scared during the whole flight that actually something bad might happen and we should have not accepted flying in an airplane fixed on the tarmac. We did file a complaint with AA for compensation, but were told that if the flight occurred they don't compensate. Was a great learning lesson, in the future will fly Southwest where no one nickel and dime you for baggage and whatnot. AA charges extra for sports equipment on domestic flights. We were told the skis fly free, but for the ski boots we have to pay, even though on the web site it says skis and ski boots are considered one bag and there no fee chart. Couldn't argue with untrained AA personnel in the airport so we paid extra baggage fees. Like I've said, we will avoid American Airlines in the future.","{'neg': 0.14, 'neu': 0.829, 'pos': 0.031, 'compound': -0.992}",-0.992

People were packed into the large room waiting for others to wander around looking for an available kiosk to scan their passport. So unorganized. How about putting the kiosks in a row for people to use while in line? Once finished, we had to stand in long lines again waiting to get checked through. There were only 7 windows open for hundreds of people to funnel through. And, not to sound like ""that guy"", but they were speeding the non-citizens through a lot faster. 2 were for working visas and students, 5 for citizens and tourists. They should be putting the tourists with the non-citizens. They should also have a line for connecting flights because this is the second time we almost missed our flight due to this mess and we weren't the only ones stressing over a connecting flight. Once we eventually got through, getting our bags was pretty quick and easy, but after that, there were no signs saying where to go next. We just got in the super long line with everyone else. My wife went ahead to talk to someone to make sure we were in the correct place. That person told her that we needed to go outside the huge room to a different place so she ran back and got my son and I and we did as he said. Once we got out and the doors closed behind us, we found out that we were in the right place before and now we had to wait for someone else to come out so we could go back in. We went to to counter to talk to them again and they said to just leave our bags there and go to our flight and they would scan them in for us. I didn't feel comfortable about just leaving our bags next to the counter while they were checking in other people who were waiting in line, but we had no choice. Our flight had started boarding and we were nowhere near the terminal. We missed using the family lane for going through security twice because the lane was roped off. Someone who works there saw us and opened it and they were genuinely surprised that he had to tell us to use it. In all the chaos, we lost one of our boarding passes, so we had to rush to the ticket counter to get a new one printed. She insisted on reprinting all 3 passes even though we only needed 1. After that was done, we started to run to the next step when my wife checked and saw they printed the wrong name on my boarding pass. We decided to just use the old one since it didn't need to be reprinted anyway. It was like she was deliberately wasting our time when we had none to waste. We ran to the tent outside (by the way, we weren't dressed for cold weather because we had no plans to leave the airport so my 7-year-old was freezing right along with us) where we were told to wait for the bus. There were so many people that we had to wait for the next one. We knew we had to go to terminal 1, but when the driver stopped, he never said anything. He just opened the door. Now, I could assume that the first stop is terminal 1, but I hate to make assumptions and get off the bus at the wrong terminal when we're already pressed for time.Luckily, someone else said they could see a ""1"" outside, so we got off and ran. We made it to our flight while they were almost finished boarding. 2 hours should have been enough time to get through, but it almost wasn't. Complete chaos, inefficiency and lack of knowledge at O'Hare. Can't rate some things because we had no time to use them.","{'neg': 0.105, 'neu': 0.855, 'pos': 0.04, 'compound': -0.992}",-0.992

LHR had the single most unnecessarily invasive, rude, redundant and down right nightmarish security checks & processing of any airport (International or domestic) we've ever encountered. And this was merely for a 'connecting' flight both times wherein we never left the secure area!

Our second Heathrow experience (returning home) was if you can believe it very much worse! Words are not enough to detail that experience and it still literally gives me nightmares and anxiety. The airport security is staffed almost exclusively by employees who almost all seemed to 'profile' travelers and ""run them through the ringer"" in the most rude, abrasive, disrespectful and insulting manner. I have no bias against any person as long they do their job properly and with respect for themselves, others and the institution they represent. The airport itself is horribly inefficient beginning with the bus transfers from arrival to departure gate areas, continuing with confusing signage or especially instructions, and finalized by some of the worst airport staff we've ever encountered in all our years flying.

Do not go with them because they are cheaper! So many reasons why we had a bad experience with the employees on each flight we took to get back and forth to Mexico and Sacramento.1.) It started off they switched our initial flight. We had to leave at 6:25am instead of 7:05am and we weren't notified about it until we called to checkin and had to ask someone to drop us off.2.) The flight from Sacramento 6:25am to Denver, younger attendant with blond wavy hair was servicing back cabin and she was rudely and onerly flirtatious with my new husband on OUR HONEYMOON to the point where it was uncomfortable for both of us and very unprofessional. After the flight when we landed. We told the southwest woman at the landing gate about it. I told her it was our honeymoon and I didnt have the ladys name. She wouldn't tell me the flight attendant's name and said she wasnt allowed. She said she herself has been accused of being flirty because of the southern hospitality and dismissed my complaint. I explained to her how that was professional and was pretty bad to the point where it was uncomfortable and I couldn't argue with the flight attendant during the flight to get kicked off. I asked if they work on tips and treat all honeymooners that way when they are paid to provide service. Also, I said if it would be a woman complaining about a man using the words sexually harassment, it would be treated differently and taken serious to avoid lawsuits.3.) Flight from Cancun to Denver comming back the brown shorthaired middle aged flight attendant providing service in the front was rude. I told her I had a question, she told me to hold on abruptly and continued to talk to another passenger about a drink. I asked her if they planned on turning off the seatbelt sign so I could go to the bathroom quickly. She answered rudely saying shes not in control of the flight, wont give permission for me to go to the bathroom and cant do anything. I told her I just asked a question and she shrugged her shoulders and walked away. During this whole time 4 people got up and went to the bathroom and she said nothing. I went fast anyways and she gave me a dirty look when I went inside and came out. 4.) We had to recheck our bags from Denver airport to Sacramento flight and nobody could help us where check in our bags and checkin into southwest after we came from Customs. We ran around for at least 20 minutes downstairs and upstairs in circles trying to figure it out and the younger guy at the southwest baggage recheck claim did not give us correct information.5.) My husband was flagged for flight checkin inside the airport only, for both return flights. I was given group A boarding status and had to try and save him a seat because his groups were B. We barely were able to sit next to eachother during our flights because other people were doing the same thing6.) Unpacking our bags after our last flight comming back to Sacramento my expensive $50.00 clinique moisture surge cream was unscrewed during the baggage process and spilled all over the luggage bag and stained it. We called and the next day the claim was denied without follow up.We have submitted an official complaint for everything and were told that they allow 30 days for a response.

I guess it is either a precaution against terrorists or something to do with preventing cannabis being brought in from elsewhere since the law changed. After a very long walk up and down various steps and escalators you arrive in a customs hall where you are told to find a kiosk with a green light. The explanatory drawing on the machine is not helpful as it refers to an ID card and doesn't tell you you need to put your passport face down. You need to be fairly skilled in inputting into a computer to answer the questionnaire. It takes skill to get your face at the right angle to get your photo taken. Staff try to help but its so busy with confused people, especially those on connecting flights panicking. Its not even clear how to get out of the hall. Staff do their best. They can't indulge in chit chat in such chaos. They must be stressed to hell. They must hate people after working in such conditions. No wonder they don't smile. After another long walk you end up in another hall with those long queues snaking through with barrier tapes. You go through a physical barrier, show your passport and customs receipt, answer more questions, with another long walk through barriers where you show your receipt twice more before you get to the baggage hall. Allow about one hour for all this at quiet times. Do not throw away, lose or screw up the receipt with your face on. You'll never get out otherwise. Before the introduction of this system you used to just join one long queue and clear customs and border control through one exit point. Yes, you queued for ages, but it was simpler. l would describe Toronto Pearson as a modern version of one of Dantes Circles of Hell.

I had booked a flight with American Airlines for this Saturday 3/7, from Santa Barbara to Phoenix for a weekend getaway.   This morning I woke with a chest and head cold....coughing and fever.   While I know I could suppress these symptoms for the duration of a short flight, but I wanted to be conscientious about not exposing a planeload of passengers to whatever I have, so I called AA to cancel my flight.   I was on hold for an hour and a half.  When I got a “customer service” agent, I explained my issue, and asked if AA was offering any special waiver of the cancellation policy due to the current Covid-19 viral pandemic.   The agent told me that Santa Barbara was not on their “flight alert” list, so no refunds or credits would apply.    I politely commented that this was too bad, since it seems to encourage people who may be sick to board a plane anyway, for fear of losing the money they paid for their flight.  The agent said (ver batum) “We’re not forcing you to go on this flight!  You don’t HAVE to go!” This was said in such a rude and sarcastic way, it took me aback.   I’ve had one other experience with AA recently, which was equally mind-boggling and negative.   I’d left my iPad on a flight last summer, and when I followed up with “lost and found” (which is a joke)  the airlines kept telling me my lost iPad was not in the Lost and Found, but they were “searching for it!  And yet the flight attendant who took my iPad to the LAX lost and found, and my “Find my  iPhone/iPad” app located it at the lost and found office at LAX.  It took me 2 weeks to get it back, and I had to drive to the airport and argue with the lost and found agent until she found it.  Right where I knew it was, but AA kept saying it wasn’t. I have only booked with AA twice in the last couple years, and these two times have left such a sour taste for me.  I will never book with them again.Why would an airline want to encourage passengers to board when they are sick, or fighting a cold, in the middle of a coronavirus outbreak that is worldwide!!!?   And why, if they choose not to offer any special waivers at this time, would they go out of their way to be rude and dismissive about it?   I guess AA doesn’t care about its customer PR, or the public’s health.Because of the current pandemic awareness of the Covid-19 coronavirus, I am shocked that American Airlines has not issued any customer statement about flying while sick or changing their cancellation policy for this time period.

I have been through airport construction projects in numerous airports and none remotely approached the inconvenience and mismanagement at La Guardia. None, nowhere. Communication was nonexistent or worse, incomprehensible. I will select a few examples from this nightmare just to illustrate. We landed hours late because of weather (to be fair, no fault of the airport). It was almost midnight. We followed the taxi signs, followed the taxi signs, followed the taxi signs until, finally, at the end of the terminal, far from the usual curbside, we at last found the taxi stand. Or so we thought. The long line waiting for taxi was actually not waiting for taxis at all, but for the bus, to take us to the taxis. Taxis were not allowed at the terminal. So we waited in torrential rain for the bus, which eventually took us to another place where we waited in the rain for a taxi. For our return, I had rented a car and had to drop it off. Unlike any other airport, there were no signs directing you to the rental car return. Fortunately or so I thought I knew my way around. I headed through a maze of construction to the place car dropoffs had been for decades . All but 2 had to move because of the construction. There were no signs or any communications informing you where to go. I asked a police officer, who kindly sent me in the wrong direction. GPS didnt work. Finally, we found the virtually unmarked dropoff. I asked why there were no signs anywhere directing people to the new dropoffs. He responded, incredibly, that we are not allowed to have signs off the airport. We waited for the shuttle bus only to find out that the shuttle bus had to take us to another shuttle bus. During construction, car rental companies, who could not have signs off the airport, were not allowed to have shuttles on the airport.

Not a busy day at the airport, arriving on a Dash 8 Q-400 (not a very large plane). Maybe 1 or two other airplanes unloading passengers and all that. I only had carry-on luggage and still it took ages to get through the security alone. Everyone was forced to be in a rather limited area of the arrivals ""kiosk security/whatever"" area. Standing in what more and more became a chaotic line as there were very poor instructions or any hints of where to go and what to do. Everyone waiting to find an empty kiosk where you had your photo taken and answered all sorts of questions regarding your stay. I was lucky since I was just travelling by myself, but others were families or single mothers with 3-4 children (trying to get a decent photo, and getting rudely told to get back to a kiosk by a staff if it wasn't up to some sort of weird standard). No signals or signs to see which kiosk was available or not, those further away were all empty since nobody saw them in the first place from where the line was entering that area. This was for all non-Canadians. After finishing that chaotic mess I was even confused and walking in circles for a bit to figure out where to head off next. Finally did and handed my passport and a receipt-like ticket with the photo and questions and answers I just did at those kiosks. Only to have the security person ask me MORE and even the same questions I already answered. To top things off, rather weird personal questions also (""why aren't you staying with your friend while visiting."" ""Who do you work for?"" ""why does your shirt have that tag on it?""). Aside from long distances to and from everywhere. Food was mediocre, wifi good. But the important travel-related stuff some of the worst I've ever experienced, even when arriving as an international in the USA. Admittedly rather lucky with my travels usually, but seeing the chaos and frustration in fellow arrivals. Some almost in tears from being returned to those damn kiosks a 3rd or 4th time, with their children crying and screaming) was very telling.","{'neg': 0.148, 'neu': 0.796, 'pos': 0.056, 'compound': -0.989}",-0.989

We departed Orlando at 9:30 am, and arrived in Chicago Midway airport around 10:20 am (time maybe off some). Before I even touchdown at Midway, the Southwest app stated my next flight had been cancelled. When I asked the flight attendant about the cancellation, they seem to take offense. One attendant say she would inquire about the cancellation with the captain, she never came back to followup with me. I had to ring my call bottom twice more, before the other attendant made an announcement about the connecting flight cancellation. Then we were directed to go to a terminal counter agent to get rebooked. I immediately became alarmed, because my luggage was checked on the plane. I needed my luggage because I was going on a cruise the next day, September 28th. When I got to the terminal counter, they rebook me for a flight at 8:00 pm. I would have to wait all day in the airport. I asked the agent why my fight was cancelled, and the agent stated because of weather. She stated that thunder was in the area. I stated to her, that planes were come and taking off, why was my plane cancelled. The thunder came later in the afternoon noon, and planes kept taking off; but more and more flights got canceled. 8:00 pm came a went, and my last flight was cancelled. I asked to get my luggage from Southwest, because I had booked a flight with America Airline the next morning, they refused, even when I told the agent I was taking a cruise the next day, and it was imperative that I get my luggage. She stated to me, not to worry, that my luggage would be on the first flight out the next morning, and would be waiting for me in Seattle Washington, at Southwest baggage claim. When I got to Seattle Washington, the next day, I went right to Southwest baggage claim, but I did not see my luggage, and I started to panic. When I ask them to check my claim ticket, the agent informed me, that my luggage would not arrive until 3:30 pm. Thats when reality hit; I would have to go on the Cruise with NO CLOTHES!!!! SHAME ON SOUTHWEST!!! They offered me money to buy clothes for a cruise that was departing in 90 minutes. Where did they think I would be able to go shopping at. On board check in was at 4:00 pm. Southwest took the wind out of my cruise; If I was not cruising with someone else, I would not have gone aboard. This was the worst experience of my life. This airline did not care that they destroyed my spirit in that moment😞","{'neg': 0.094, 'neu': 0.895, 'pos': 0.011, 'compound': -0.989}",-0.989

For the most part, Delta has done a stellar job of getting me where I needed to be, when I needed to be there, for a fair fare.But, with the recent handling of a damaged bag claim, I saw the inflexible, uncaring, corporate side of Delta that makes all air travelers cringe at the mention of air travel.Simple story.  Baggage handles tore one of my bags.  It was a high quality, nice, functional bag.  I followed the airline protocol, reported the damage at the arrival airport, filled out all the ridiculously long forms and information....and, waited.Finally, I received an email linking me to a company Delta uses for damaged luggage replacement.  I found a bag that looked similar to my damaged bag, clicked on it and a few days later the new bag arrived at my home.  Except, the replacement bag was inferior to my damaged bag in every way.  I contacted Delta and returned the inferior replacement bag.THEN THE DELTA ""TWO-STEP"" BEGAN!Since they were unable/unwilling to actually replace my damaged bag I was offered 35% of my bag's original retail value.I rejected the offer since I have no access to a luggage flea market where quality used luggage can be purchased for 35% of it's actual value/cost.The emails continued for a week.  NO REASONABLE RESOLUTION!When I was in grammar school, I was taught that if you damaged or destroyed another person's property, you were punished for your wrong and were required to replace/restore the damaged property.A business like Delta which cannot/will not operate with the most rudimentary essentials of common courtesy and respect to those we ""harm"", is a business which is fundamentally flawed in their philosophy of customer relations.Now I know that the true cost of flying Delta is the published fare, plus 65% of the value of your potentially damaged/lost luggage.I'll continue to fly Delta.  I still have to get where have to go.  Sad...that a company wins my business...only by default.","{'neg': 0.169, 'neu': 0.749, 'pos': 0.083, 'compound': -0.9887}",-0.9887

Flying time between TPA and MIA is just 37 minutes, but weather-related issues made for a TPA departure that was 20 minutes late. On landing at MIA, we then taxied to a halt that lasted 40-45 minutes before a gate was found for us. Pax with tight connections grew anxious as we waited. The AA captain himself lost patience with the false promises of any early move to a gate. A rush to connecting gates and disgustingly dirty bathrooms ensued when we finally deplaned. BA0208 was just starting to board when I finally reached my gate.

I have not flown a lot in my life but when I do I usually have 18+ hour journeys. As a citizen of the United States, it is nice to come back after a few years. Well, after an eight hour flight over the ocean, the first thing you are met with is passport control. I have to say that the TSA, guards and police who work there are some of the most unhappy, unhelpful, and rude people I have ever had the mispleasure of interacting with. There were many lines and unclear, sometimes conflicting instructions. We were met with a man who did nothing but treat everyone like an animal, yelling and being rude to people who were confused. Even after the handful of times I have flown, flying and airports are still daunting and I feel sorry for the people who are first time flyers or tourists who will be met with this the first time they are in the country. In May, when I arrived with my boyfriend from a European country, we were met with hostility. When attempting to go through the line, they asked if we were family, if we were from the same household, which we were. The woman simply barked at us that we were indeed not together or family before we could even say anything. She then told her colleague to not help us because we were trying to get through the line faster. We were separated, he needed to be pulled to another line and I was forced to wait at least an hour on the other side. Needless to say we missed our next flight. I've never been so poorly treated in my life. These people should be ashamed of themselves. I understand they have an important job to do but there is no excuse for being so hateful and so rude to people, most of which are confused or afraid. We were almost in tears by the time the process was over. This airport was a stark contrast to the previous in London which was quick, painless and effective. Charlotte Douglas is anything but. On a brighter note, after we got through security, we talked to a woman to rebook our flight and she was very nice and very helpful. The security process is so long, so uncomfortable and the people are so rude I couldn't possibly recommend this place. I hope I never have to arrive in that airport again. Nothing says welcome to the USA like a bunch of angry people screaming at you and treating you like yesterday's trash.","{'neg': 0.161, 'neu': 0.74, 'pos': 0.098, 'compound': -0.9883}",-0.9883

Once we boarded the airplane, a young boy sitting directly behind me was coughing non-stop. This was concerning me so I quietly found something to cover my face. When the child's father saw I had done this, it upset him so he began antagonizing me by fake coughing. After this went on for a while, I stepped to the back to speak with a flight attendant and request that I be moved to a different seat. She was helpful and used her seating chart to locate an alternate spot for me. As she led me to my new seat, another flight attendant came from the front, visibly angry and stopped us from proceeding. She began pointing her finger at me and yelling. She forbade me to sit there and became more aggravated when I asked that she stop shaking her finger in my face and yelling at me. At one point, she went to the boy's father and he lied. He told her he was about to offer me a mask. We never had any proof that he had any masks and he and his son were not using masks themselves. Her temper continued to escalate when I asked her for her name and she pushed her nametag towards my face and told me it was Jennifer. Her anger towards me caused her to yell at other passengers. In the midst of all of this, another flight attendant suggested that Jennifer contact the captain to resolve the issue because she kept yelling and was acting unprofessional. But Jennifer went to a phone in the front and called the police. She slammed down the phone and continued to hit things the whole time. When the police arrived, Jennifer was shaking in anger and shook the door trying to open it for them. They escorted me and my sister off the plane and forced us to take a later flight. Despite our attempts to get American airlines to cover our hotel, they were unwilling to do so. All attempts to contact the airline and voice my dissatisfaction with the staff's lack of concern for their passengers' health or the way I was treated by Jennifer have been met with resistance. They continue to show no interest in rectifying the situation. I have never experienced such treatment from any airline before and will avoid flying American ever again after this experience.","{'neg': 0.116, 'neu': 0.867, 'pos': 0.018, 'compound': -0.9881}",-0.9881

I'm a Mets fan.The trip was to occur in late March and early April 2020. But COVID-19 was raging in Washington State and NYC, and both states implemented severe travel restrictions. I had to cancel the tickets in late March 2020. I requested refunds from United and American due to state manadated lockdown.United eventually refunded their ticket. American Airlines has, however, refused to refund and denied my subsequent two appeals.An American's customer relations agent claim that I voluntarily canceled the trip and, therefore, was denying my refund request. This agent, instead, offered a travel extension in lieu of the refund that will expire at the end of December 2021. Since I have no plans to travel anytime soon, the economy is collapsing all around us and no one knows when the pandemic will end, so the extension is not a solution for me and unwanted.My last attempt at a refund was to reach out to American Airlines corporate headquarters in October 2020 to inform them they are losing a decades long customer in order to pocket $238.20. The people at corporate sent my letter back to the above mentioned customer relations agent who gleefully left a voicemail informing me they are CHOOSING not to refund the $238.20 and they are SORRY I'm angry about it.I will end this cautionary tale of theft by and utter disgust with American Airlines with the last part of the letter I sent to the CEO:""At this point, I have no recourse other than to accept the fact that American Airlines has decided to criminally pocket my $238.20.

When in Seattle, I learned that my flight to PVG was oversold by 10 and the gate agent begged for volunteers, offering $700 to take another flight. The gate agent OFFLOADED my bag long before boarding, and it ended up that I was able to get on the flight (albeit in a middle seat). Got to PVG without my bag, and immediately went to lost baggage center and had the agent there (who understandably hardly spoke a lick of English and didn't know Delta's procedures). Called baggage services as soon as I got to my hotel, explained the situation, and asked if anything else needed to be done. Was told that all was set and to file my receipts for expense reimbursement ""as soon as possible"". Got my bag 3 days later after I had racked up the price of my ticket cost in having to replace items that Delta had lost...when I got home I had to deal with moving to a new city immediately for a new job and dealing with the deteriorating health of a terminally ill family member but knew that I had to file my receipts sooner than later (I was not given a deadline and no such deadline was on Delta's terrible complaint webpage). Tried inputting my information only to realize that THE AGENT AT PVG HAD FAILED TO PROPERLY REPORT MY LOST BAG, and that all I could do at that point was email baggage services. Emailed them and received a response that I had exceeded the 21 day deadline to file a claim, even though THEIR AGENT had messed up and NO ONE that I spoke to informed me of such a deadline even when I asked (this deadline was not even on their website but is rather conveniently hidden in their contract of carriage). Responded to them explaining that no one had informed me of either a deadline to file my claim let alone properly report my lost baggage. I explained that I would have certainly acted differently if this deadline had been made clear to me (ie one of their bag service reps told me or gave me more clear instructions), and also explained my personal circumstances that had prevented me from filing the claim earlier regardless of not knowing the timeline...the bag claims manager who responded (Marie Djato) disregarded everything I said and gave me the obviously bogus ""we understand your situation"" and instead gave me a $100 voucher that was literally a slap in the face to me and my loyalty to Delta...immediately booked a cheap ticket with it that I don't ever plan on using for the sole purpose of throwing the voucher away...will never set foot on another Delta plane for the rest of my time on this planet and would literally gift my status and 133k skymiles for free if I could cause I no longer have a use for themTo Marie Djato...shame on you!

I also have a condition where a bone in my tail bone keeps breaking, also I have a one year old. I NEEDED wheel chair assistant. Well, my first flight went fine. Arrived in Paris and there was no wheel chair. They kept telling me to wait so I did. Waiting and waiting chasing my walking everywhere one year where you first exist the plane. No seat, no bathroom to change her, no water to prepare milk. I kept waiting and finally the nice guy came and told me if we don’t go you’ll miss your flight I don’t know where they are. He was frustrated too. So, he grabbed my bag and I carried my 30+ lb daughter all the way across the airport. Finally to a counter where there was still no wheel chair or help. I had 30 min to reach my flight. So another worker had to carry my daughter ( I don’t want strangers carrying my little girl, but had no choice and needed help)  and I carried my stuff all the way to my flight. Finally got to gate and I kept telling him I need to clean her up. The last flight she puked all over me and her and I couldn’t get her poo cleaned off enough on the plane. So, they said hurry and I had to carry all my stuff and her to the bathroom. By the time I got back my face was red and I was in so much pain I just wanted to fall down crying. I thought once I got on plane I’d be fine. So, got on plane sit with her we get going and I’m in comfort plus. My back starts to really hurt. I can’t hardly sit on my behind. My upper back from the scoliosis started hurting so if I sat up to stretch it pushed on tailbone more. My poor daughter trying to sleep and I keep shifting around. After that long painful flight got to Atlanta and there was wheel chairs waiting so I thought ohhhh great! Thank you! Well no.. he took me as far as customs dropped me off said someone would come back and they never did. Again, 30 min before flight I had to carry my daughter get my luggage, thank you custom guy for putting my bags in cart. Then push her carry a baby to the drop off luggage area. Thankfully that woman said I could take my stroller. Bless her cause I had to run to get to the train. Long story short missed my flight. So standing waiting. Soo angry. Hurting soo bad holding my daughter. I don’t know if I should cry cuss or just die there. The girl at counter acted mad that she had to work. Said she’d get me a hotel to shuttle to. Said she’d call them to wheel chair me there. Guess what? Nope.. no wheel chair so off I go with my daughter looking for shuttle. Get outside rain and cold. My daughter didn’t have any thing but a thin cardigan because my sister was waiting to bring her coat in xna. Get outside go to shuttle get to hotel wait and wait in line. Finally get in line and we have no food. Haven’t ate since flight. My daughter was sleeping so she missed dinner. No water for her formula. Thankfully hotel girl gave me like 5 bottles. The room was paid for, so I’m grateful for at least that. Get to room no WiFi. No help to fix it went down two times carrying a baby. I finally just gave up put my baby to sleep and just dosed. I hurt so bad I couldn’t hardly sleep. I got up at 4am got her ready and back to airport to catch my flight. Stood in line asked if they could help with food and water. My debit card wasn’t with me had cash but not enough to keep buying 4 dollar water and 10 dollar sandwiches plus ran out of wipes( 16 wipes 3 dollar). So he got me wheel chair said if I needed anything to let them know. That the 15 dollar food ticket was good anywhere. It’s not. And 15 dollars isn’t crap in an airport restaurant so I had to pay out of pocket even after the 15 dollar help. Then I had one more for water.. just went to my gate and waited loaded and finally got to see my family after two years and my dad finally met his grand daughter for the first time. I missed my first day with my family. I’m only here two weeks. I’m hurting so bad still couldn’t enjoy Christmas because I’m in more pain than usual. None of my meds are helping.

They may not complain but I saw the poor woman standing in distress asking someone to bring her one. I heard the way they talked to the elderly who asked for one. The way you treat disabled people is disgusting. I have to use you to fly back but will I do it again? Absolutely not. I’ll look for a better way. Do I recommend delta?

Our flight was delayed due to the President's visit and inclement weather. When we finally reached our gate after sitting on the tarmac for over an hour, we were delayed further due to a lack of staffing to park our aircraft. Once deplaned, we raced to our connection only to find the flight had closed (well outside of the 10-min window of departure time). The excuse provided for the lack of staffing at our arrival gate: lightning and staff safety. Yet, staff were evidently not in any danger to guide our departing flight out of the gate, a fact we found quite interesting. Many customers were left stranded and when trying to rebook flights, the responses from AA workers ranged from eye rolls to terse replies. Never did any employee of the airline or the airport acknowledge what every passenger was feeling. A simple, ""We understand you are upset and we are doing what we can to make the rest of your trip as pleasant as possible."" As we stood in a customer service line, one airline employee passed out customer service number tickets. When asked by several passengers where our luggage might be, she replied, ""Whatever flight you were supposed to be on, that's where your luggage is."" Many people informed her that our connections had already left before we arrived. Yet, she stuck with her (obviously incorrect) statement of next-flight luggage transport, absolutely clueless. We were able to rebook on a flight the next day (2 p.m.) but needed to find something earlier for work obligations. At 11:50 p.m. we left the main concourse, past the TSA area, and headed to the main ticketing counter. Unbeknownst to us (and hundreds others), TSA closes their gates at midnight. No signage, no verbal notice, no nothing. We were locked out of any food, beverages, seating, carpeting, etc. until the airport reopened at 4:30 a.m. We found a quiet place to sit (on the floor, with a locked door next to us) and charge our devices near the baggage carousel. Not long after settling in, an airport employee saunters up and says, ""You gone hafta move from that do'."" As we gather our things to move, the employee then says, ""I don't know why you so upset. You know you can't sit in front of that do'."" Our response: ""Because this airport is horrible."" His response: ""Ain't nobody tole you to come heah."" And this was the basic attitude of every single employee we encountered from our arrival until our eventual departure. We did attempt to make a purchase at the Starbucks at the ticket counter. True to CLT form, the oven was broken and they had run out of the one thing I cared to order. And passengers were due to arrive in less than 4 hours. To be served what remained to be seen. If the presence of a high-profile official and a brief storm delay can render this airport all but useless, an actual emergency will bring the entire city to its knees. There is clearly no plan to address the lack of airport personnel, availability of rental cars, hotel rooms, etc. and neither American Airlines nor the CLT airport gave any effort whatsoever to aid passengers in navigating such a challenging experience.

We recently returned from a 10-day Honeymoon in Hawaii.  We booked three different accommodations through Southwest Hotels.  In all three instances, we were severely disappointed with the room selection upon check-in. Kind of like when flying Southwest and you get that C45 boarding assignment, you know you are screwed,  you can expect that same outcome when you book thru Southwest Hotels. Guarantee you will get that dreaded middle seat, back of the plane, non reclining seat(or room) option! We booked the hotels highest rated Oceanfront room (its our honeymoon!) only to get checked in and find out we were given the view of the pool, slide and 35ft concrete wall of the room next door (wait Oceanfront??) Unfortunately, with Southwest hotels, you pay upfront and it is non-refundable.  We tried to change rooms and when we were unable to, just left the hotel and went elsewhere. I strongly encourage you to avoid our pain and book through the hotel directly or another site, as Southwest Hotels does not carry any weight with the hotels themselves and in turn leave, us, their clients, vulnerable to the worst possible room selections and experiences at our destinations with no option for recourse.

The area was packed with passengers with no security in sight. After checking in at a kiosk and receiving a boarding pass and luggage tag, I was approached by an elderly European gentleman and his ""daughter"" asking me to assist them with putting their passport into the kiosk. After placing an obviously foreign passport (by the cover) into the kiosk, it showed that their passport was not valid and so they had to attend at a physical check-in desk for help. I pointed to where they had to go and as they disappeared into the throng of travellers, I turned to find my backpack gone. Inside were my passport, large sum of cash, all travel documents for 7 flights and 4 hotels in Thailand, credit/debit/health cards with driver's licence, new iPad/earphones and a litany of other travel items. After an initial frantic search, I made my way to the police booth which was halfway along the terminal. Here I was told to ""fill out a report on-line"" despite being scheduled to fly out in 2.5hrs. In the end, I was directed throughout the terminal to various locations including airport Lost & Found, AirCanada Lost & Found, Border Services Agency and other areas looking for my bag. Police and ""public safety"" officers who attended sometime later were of no help and upon my request only contacted video surveillance only to be told that ""no cameras covered that area where the theft occurred? Post-911 and an international airport has no surveillance on one of the busiest areas of the airport where the national airline checks in its passengers? Police advised that theft and fraud is rampant at the airport with groups of organized criminals operating daily on an unchallenged basis throughout the terminals and that many crimes go unreported as victims often leave the country without filing any report but crime warning signs are nowhere to be seen. As a Canadian citizen, however, my situation was different and somewhat catastrophic and almost ten days later, still requires paperwork, phone calls and expensive replacement of documents. Needless to say, my bag and contents were never found as of this this date. I lost my vacation, I lost my money, I lost my passport and tickets, I lost my electronics and almost all of my personal financial details under the nose of the Airport Authority and according to them, with no recourse for recovery or reimbursement!

The flights down were okay but this wanting to charge my wife and I another $44 ($22 ea.) just to sit next to each other for a 1hr. connecting flight was crazy. That would have been on top of the additional $44 for the 2hr flight making a total of $88 one way just to sit together. We didn't play the reindeer games. But the worst was the flight back up from Dallas/Ft.Worth. They board you on the plane earlier than expected which sounds good as you think you may take off a bit early just to find out that now you are on the plane an extra 45 minutes sealed up and hot. There was no air running or coming out of the vent to the rear seats the entire flight. My wife said it was reasonable in Row 4. Plus as you get to the rear of the plane, it is like it narrows. The guy next to me at the window seat was not even a big guy and we were almost on top of each other. My arm on my seat is suppose to go up and it didn't. It suppose to recline back maybe 2 inches. It didn't. I thought my seat was bad but when I got up to get off the plane, the lady in front of me, her entire arm on her seat was broke. I wanted to take a picture but my battery was dead on my phone. Grrrr. When I was sitting in the back few rows looking at others reactions and observing the plane. It was just showing age and signs of being poorly maintained. I even feel that the cabin pressure was not right. My ears pop from time to time on a plane but the pain was terrible on this flight. It literally felt like someone pushed a Q-Tip too far in my ear and they still ached for a week after the flight. The pilot spoke about maybe 25 minutes to land or something but the sound system is so poor, no one could even make out what he was truly saying. Speaking of pilot. I will give credit that take off and landing were the best part of the trip but as a plane. I felt the most unsafe ever. I have taken many flights over the year and this was the worst by far as a plane to be on.Overall after the last 4-5 planes I have been on with American Airlines and this last flight by far.

One of them was fully staffed but TSA officers were just standing around, laughing and high-fiving each other for several minutes. Then, they allowed a number of people who had only just entered, to proceed to this newly opened line, when everyone else who had been waiting for 15+ minutes were kept waiting. One particular demeaning and nasty TSA individual on a power trip was working the line I went through. As usual, there were no bins to put items in so I waited next to the belt. I was then yelled at ""Why are you standing around, you're holding up the line"". I politely explained that I was waiting for them to restock the bins to which he responded by yelling at me, ""Nobody told you to do that, keep moving. You're holding up the line"". I turned to the passengers behind me, and they looked as apologetic as I did. Another TSA worker then quickly restocked the bins, but the hostility and rudeness of the TSA staff really shocked me. I don't think I will be traveling through this airport again if I can avoid it, and rather attend my meeting as a phone call, or worst case, drive.

From the beginning even before my journey started I had issues. American Airlines changed my flight schedule without informing me. The departure time was the same but all the connections where different as well as the arrival time. I didn’t let that bother me since they were small changes. Once I left Canada I landed in Philadelphia at 730am. I had a 7h layover at the Philadelphia airport. 3 hours into the layover, I heard an announcement saying that the flight was delayed do to maintenance. At that point, I proceeded to the American airlaine customer service desk. A gentleman greeted me asking what the problem was. I started explaining that my flight was delayed and it might have an impact on my connecting flights. In addition, I was meeting a friend in Costa Rica and it was important I arrive on January 21st. He looked at my itinerary and informed me that I will need to stay the night in Philadelphia and leave for Costa Rica in the morning, since I would not be able to make my connection flight from Miami To Costa Rica. I was floored! He barley typed anything on his computer and had no empathy for my situation. At that point, I started talking to one of his coworkers and she started digging into additional solutions. She managed to book me a flight with two connections but it was going to be a close call. I took what she gave me and THANKED her! Running to my connections was not easy but I was able to make all the flights and arrive at my destination on time. Looking back at this, I can’t believe one of the American Airline employees tried to take the easy way out and keep me overnight. Upon my arrival I see no bags... I had to wait in San Jose for a day for my bags. No apologies or compensation were provided by the airline. I would like to say that the journey stops here but it does not... When I checked into American Airlines to leave from Costa Rica, I see that the flight changed again without any notice. Clearly this is American Airlines M.O. This time, my flight was arriving at my final destination in more then 8h later then previously planned and I had an airport change that was more then 100miles away from JFK. In addition to that, I had to absorb the extras charges for my transportation from one airport to another. I called American Airline right away to change my flights and understand what had happened. They informed me it was an operational change. I stay on the phone with the America Airline agent trying to find a solution. She says that there is nothing she can do other then look at different airlines. She then persisted to put me on hold for 20 minutes and never came back to the phone. I decide that I will try to talk to an agent once I got to the airport. At the airport in Costa Rica, I spoke to one of the agents about my situation, she was really nice and tried to help the most she could. She found a different flight that required an airport change but only about 15miles away from JFK. I take that offer since it was better then my previous one. I was still not happy since I, “the customer” had to stress, argue and spend more money on a flight plan that was already scheduled and arranged. When I arrive in New York, I got a US phone plan to call the American airline customer service. At that point they inform me that the flight was canceled due to weather. I found that very odd since that’s not what the first or the second agents told me... I continue talking to the representative to see what they could do. They insist that they couldn’t do ANYTHING... No standby, no discount, no meal voucher, no first class, no nothing. I could not believe that everything that happened along my flight was because of American Airlines and barely anyone from the company would apologizes or cared about my situation. Being in a foreign country with little to no help was scary and I could only imagine the scare and panic a solo, new to travelling individual would be experiencing. All in all I would give American Airline two thumbs down, a 0/10. This airline does not take customer service seriously and when you need help they will do the bare minimum to help.

The line was painfully long in immigration especially for the non-citizens and when I tried to ask a question to one employee she interrupted me mid question to tell me to keep walking. She treated the next two people who approached her in this same manner. The two women trying to organize the line did it by yelling and talking in bossy, annoyed tones to the hundreds of innocent people who were all just trying to do what they said. When someone made a mistake, heaven forbid if you didnt exactly understand what go to the end means when the room is the size of a football field, then that poor person was berated by the employee who then walked away shaking her head as if every human was an idiot. After our first two negative interactions I started talking to my kids about how we should treat people. They could see how the employees we treating everyone and they could tell that we were just trying to obey whatever rules were in place to avoid being singled out.

Be prepared for any and all necessary and unnecessary delays by incompetent workers, who sit around speaking to each other in their own mother-languages and don't stop their personal conversations to assist travelers.  Yesterday's flights were Seattle to YYC, connecting through YVR. We had to disembark, follow poor signage to pick up luggage, that I thought had been checked all the way through, but turns out was only ticketed all the way through. So, go to baggage claim, pick up luggage, go back to West Jet, check back in, wait for employees to stop chatting so they could override the kiosk check-in system, which would not accept my pre-ticketed suitcase. Check in suitcase, get new boarding passes, go through security. Security was an absolute nightmare.  Get shuffled into the new, and poorly designed, cattle type belt, with one person per one narrow space. As I pull my purse strap off my 25 yo diamond earring that my husband gave me for our wedding (and is the ONLY earring I have ever worn) goes flying off my right ear, and I'm being bumped from both left and right sides, and it literally becomes a brutal race by all security passengers to force their own plastic bin onto the belt first. But I suffered a TBI (traumatic brain injury) and don't have the balance and stability to keep bending down to retrieve a plastic bin and stand straight back up, without assistance. As I do this 4 times, to accommodate their separation rules, I notice my son accidentally left a pack of smoked salmon we purchased in Seattle, so I reach over to pick it up and lose my balance. He's 20 yo and has no excuse, accept to say that everyone is so harried, no one can peacefully load up their bins. Next I attempt to walk through the security scanner, and have to give that 3 tries: 1 to remove a bracelet,1 to remove a fabric belt with metal buckle, 1 to remove my runners. When I attempt to ask for assistance to locate my earring lost in the shuffle, I notice behind 2 security guards, that my entire suitcase is opened on a metal table in front of someone else! I darted over to that table to ask what was gong on? Only to be told I couldn't travel with that many cosmetics. What really embarrassed me was that the inept guard also removed a clearly marked bag of medications, for the entire line behind me now forming to see.There's absolutely no privacy and no respect for privacy. I am utterly embarrassed, with no shoes, no belt, no purse, I'm sorting through the mess this guard just made to cram my travel size toiletries into the prescribed plastic bag.  I was unnerved to say the least. I ask where the rest of my belongings are, and he says he doesn't know. I ask for a manager at this point, who takes several minutes to appear and am literally told to my face that this is how it's being done 'today.'

My flight was delayed by 2.5 hours from PDX to DFW where we were supposed to catch our connecting flight to CUN. With the original booking, we only had and hour and a half window from landing in DFW to flying out. Also, where we had a handful of wedding guests meet us in DFW To fly into CUN together. At first they AA didn’t tell us why we were waiting for so long, then the pilot gets on and tells us that something is leaking and won’t stop 😳 At this point we already want to get off the plane, but they never tell us that that is an option. An hour into the wait the pilot says we may have to change planes because the leak isn’t stopping and there’s an empty plane next to us, but he has to wait for permission to let us board. Another 45 minutes, pilot now tells us that we are good to go and the leaking has stopped. Finally, we’re on our way and none of us know what to expect because we’re thinking AA will hold the other plane with so many of us being delayed. AA never once mentions that we should look into booking new flights or advises us if our next flights will be held for us. All they say is to check the app or website for updates. There were 13 people in our party leaving together (there was at least another dozen people who were also going to CUN from PDX as we later found out). So we finally land in DFW, no one there to tell us where to go or helps anyone getting off. Luckily, one of our friends got off the plane first and asked someone where our next flight would be. When we get to the gate, we find out our connecting flight took off 5 minutes before we landed 😒We ran around the airport trying to figure out where to find the next flight leaving to CUN.The airline had terrible communication between each other because they had us running from gate d22 to d24 for about an hour. We had no time to stop and find food or even use the restroom since no one was giving us the right information and we spent the whole time waiting in the wrong lines trying to get onto the next flight out. Finally, there were two seats available, so the groom and I sadly left our party behind in DFW to head to CUN first where the rest of our party was waiting. The people we left had to stay the night and pray for room on the next flight out the following day.Due to the delayed flights, our luggage did not get to us in time. American Airlines did offer to let us purchase items and get reimbursed, but by the time I got to the resort, everything was closed. I didn’t even have an opportunity to purchase anything to get me by.The experience gets worse!!! I had multiple items taken from my luggage. No one else, but one of my bridesmaids experienced this as well. I seriously doubted my packing and second guessed if I packed my things or not. I’m home now and the items that I knew I packed are not home either which means they were taken during transport. Some of the items taken included things I was going to use on my wedding day: brand new perfume, a soap bar (I could still smell that cucumber Dove soap bar in my luggage), Nike slides, Oregon Ducks Jersey, swim suit, hair straightener, and portable charger. After the mayhem, we learned that our guests who were stuck in DFW did get one free hotel stay and $12 food vouchers. Once we all got home, the guests that didn’t make the first night, all requested reimbursements for their lost one-night stay, They were only able to get $175 AA vouchers and no reimbursement for their lost one-night stay at our resort in Cancun. Which was at least $250 a person, so the voucher did not make up for the loss. The bridesmaid who also had items taken from luggage called AA while we were in Mexico to report the stolen items and the representative advised that when we land back in PDX, to go talk to the airline. We did exactly that and the agent gave us lost and found cards to report our missing items, even though our items were not lost by us. We go ahead and do the claim through this method only to find out it’s not the right claim. Luckily, my bridesmaid had a baggage claim phone number and passed it along to me. I finally call a week after hearing nothing back from the lost and found claim only to be told that’s the wrong claim and that I had to contact the airline within 7 days of when I began my travel. I’m livid when the representative tells me that my claim is now too late. Luckily, because the claim was done online, there’s an email and that was enough to make the claim valid. I was lucky and my representative felt sorry for me, so she ended up refunding me for my lost items. My bridesmaid was not so lucky and had a very rude representative who took her time working the claim. My bridesmaid got through to a manager and eventually got things taken care of. Lessons learned: DO NOT FLY WITH AA, don’t check in bags, and avoid connecting flights at all costs.","{'neg': 0.099, 'neu': 0.836, 'pos': 0.065, 'compound': -0.983}",-0.983

The day started with a rude check-in agent who was passive aggressive and verbally assaulted me for not knowing how to put on my luggage tag. I asked for help but she was not happy. Pay for a checked bag and they make you feel terrible about it? Strike 1.TSA was pretty slow at Reagan but I can't fault the airline for that. Also the food options were very limited in the terminal and generic, I will happily fly out of BWI (1st choice) or Dulles (2nd choice) instead. Arrived at my gate about 2 hours early before boarding and relaxed. Before I knew it, the aircraft pulled up to the gate... wait, is that the emergency slide hanging off the side of the aircraft?! Yep, their crew accidentally deployed the slide so they delayed the flight 2 hours to repair it. I get it, mistakes happen and they brought out food and drinks for passengers to eat in the meantime. Not a bad thought and appreciated (the only good part it seems). After I got some food, I went up to the gate agent and confirmed I would not miss my connection in O'hare and she assured me I would not.2 Hours passes and they extend the delay another hour to make the repairs. At this point, I would miss my connection so I went to the gate agent again. I asked if I could get on another flight so I could make my connection and she asked my ticketing class. She gave me side eye and said ""oh theres nothing we can do"". From this point on, she refused to acknowledge or help me in any way. TStrike 2. To Customer Service I go to rebook my connection. See, this could all be avoided if my ticketing class was economy and not basic economy, lesson learned. My rebooking options were terrible and the only other flight from Chicago to Wausau was 8 hours after my original flight. This suddenly became the layover from hell. No compensation or anything, they would not work with me unless I bought a whole new ticket.  Strike 3.3 hours go by and still no word so they delayed the flight another 20 minutes. Then another 20. And another 20 minutes, no communication from staff and they would not let me rebook unless the flight cancelled. Essentially, they could delay into eternity and I would be held hostile. 5 hours and 45 minutes after the original departure we could board. The gate agent was yelling at everyone to board faster so we would not miss our departure slot and I was happy to leave Ronald Reagan. Strike 4.Arriving in O'hare, I went to the service desk to beg for compensation, all I could get was a meal voucher and boy did I have to move mountains for it. My connecting flight left on time (a regional jet) and the flight itself was a dream, minus the miserable flight attendant. Strike 4.5 (lol).Overall, I learned an important lesson, basic economy is tempting but you essentially sign over all your rights. It is fine if nothing goes wrong but if it does, you are mercifully screwed and at the will of the airline. Next time, I'll pay the extra $60 for economy but I will never fly AA again. Terrible customer service and HORRIBLE flight prices. United is far better for regional services and Southwest for anything else. #neverAAagain.","{'neg': 0.152, 'neu': 0.738, 'pos': 0.11, 'compound': -0.9818}",-0.9818

He told us the quickest way would be to go to the end of the G gates and take a shuttle to the M International terminal to avoid having to exit the airport and go through security again. Once we got to G17 where the shuttle was, a female airport worker told us she needed to see our boarding passes and passports. We handed them over and she said she couldn't allow us to be shuttled until she confirmed our flight was still there. I told her that my Delta app confirmed that the flight was delayed by 30 minutes. I had also heard an announcement that all flights were delayed from the weather since no planes were able to take off or land. She insisted on checking Google Flights for her update as well as got on her walkie-talkie to ask someone who was in the international wing if our flight was still there. Meanwhile, the clock is ticking and we need to board our plane. This person who works at the damn airport would not use the airport computer to check our flight status and continued to rely on Google Flights. She told us that she would not shuttle us over because apparently our flight had left. I told her she was wrong and she refused. I was furious.

I am not going to complain about things they have no control over like TSA lines or airline queues though their queue lines for taking passengers to the Rental Car Station was 100 yards long. I am going to complain about an unsafe practice that is directly caused by airport management. The use of buses to take passengers to their planes is something I have seen before and understand. However, filling the buses with passengers like sardines with carry on luggage is a recipe for disaster. I complained to the workers and they kept pushing people in. As I expected, the bus had to come to a hard stop (normally I would not have considered the stop as bad), and everyone wound up bumping into each other and tripping over luggage. No one was hurt but this is an accident waiting to happen. They had four buses queued up and it was unnecessary to unsafely pack this many people just because they think this is a subway car or a street bus. I choose to be on those and subject myself to that when necessary but not at an airport with carry on luggage. The other disappointing feature of the airport is its dinginess. The outside areas where you wait are poorly maintained with debris all over along with dirty walls and sidewalks. Not what I have come to expect from a US airport.

I wish they made up for the MISTAKE and gave us a better venue perhaps closer to establishments especially with the cold weather and not being prepared for that. Instead we stayed in our room with the view of the highway. and spent the day calling 3 hotels in Belize, 1 in Guatamala (as part of our trip itinerary), a car rental, expedia, delta and arranged the booking changes we had to make in order to accomodate to our new arrival date which messed up with the day to day schedule of our trip. As a result, we lost some money and paid over pricey dinner at the  Atlanta hotel  since the dinner voucher was only valid in the airport. We didn't have much option due to the frigid temperature and didn't want to spend more money on a cab. Delta denied to refund us  for the hotel that we paid for our first night in Belize after we asked. In addition, we moved  3 different hotel rooms on the first 3 consecutive nights of our vacation since our resort in Belize didn't have the same available room! We lost 400 CAD dollars plus  both of our 1 DAY PAID VACATION (1 day in Atlanta of our 10 paid vacation) and  1 DAY OFF to recuperate before getting back to work.  We got back home at 2:00 am Monday morning and then had to work at 8:30 am. We  accepted the next day return flight since we needed to make up for the  lost day to suit our 10 day itinerary due to our trip being booked-solid for 10 days  that included tours. Since Delta failed to get us to our main destination on schedule, this made a HUGE inconvenience between TIME AND MONEY. I would appreciate reimbursement of what we lost in  hotel booking for the first night, roaming and long distance fees,dinner we paid in Atlanta and our 1 DAY PAID VACATION DAY COMBINED. We are not asking for anything other than what we feel is owed to us in monetary value while this doesn't include the time, stress and inconvenience that this delay have caused us. Like all others, our time is very important and valuable. We would appreciate to be compensated for the damages.","{'neg': 0.11, 'neu': 0.826, 'pos': 0.065, 'compound': -0.9786}",-0.9786

-0.9745,2020-02-01,2020-02-01,10.0,Don't waste you money on American Airlines,"I was going overseas but left a day early for LA in case of weather to have extra time. Weather was rain moving across the country. We sat on the tarmac at Phillie for 2 hours. The pilot periodically talked to us. He said at the 2-hour mark that we'd be leaving in 10 minutes. Instead, 10 minutes later he got on the intercom and said he'd timed out and needed to return to the gate! How could he not have known minutes earlier that this was going to occur? At the gate we left the plane and got back in line to rebook - 3rd in line (we were seated in 1st class). But AA staff told us no need, that they were going to have another crew come to the plane and fly us to LA, so we sat down. After another hour we were informed there was no crew coming, and the flight was canceled. What!? We were lied to by the pilot, and now the ground staff, and now 100 people were in that line that I was earlier 3rd in but told to leave. We got on the phone to rebook, but they only could offer us 1st class 30 hours later - not in time to make our flight to Tahiti. Normally, they would book someone in the next available flight, even if on another airline, to maintain decent customer service and relations. Obviously unimportant with AA. After over an hour on the phone we finally insisted on talking to a supervisor and explained our situation again. The supervisor was able to put us on another AA flight later that night, but in economy. I was told that I would be reimbursed. Unfortunately, with the original flight canceled and no solution in sight earlier in the evening, I had to cancel my original hotel in LA so I would not be charged. Once they were eventually able to find me a later flight, I tried to rebook at that hotel but they had filled up. They booked me nearby but apparently at a hotel without a 24-hour shuttle. We arrived at LAX at 11:30 but the shuttle to the hotel stopped at 11 PM - thanks, again, American Airlines! So far off to a terrible start to my Tahiti vacation! Upon my return to the US, I called AA and asked if I could have the 1st class going back across the country, as I'd originally booked 1st class going west, but economy going east on my return. I figured I'd give them a chance to make it right, again, and live with it. They of course let me down again and I went economy. So - what would happen with my refund from the fiasco at the beginning of the trip? The supervisor I spoke with upon returning to the US assured me that I would be reimbursed. Once home I tried calling but AA forces you to do things online to avoid dealing with actual people.  I followed the procedure for getting a refund, was left a voicemail by someone but no callback number. I sent email to them and finally was given an amount - it was laughable. I should have been reimbursed about $700 or $800 per ticket. Instead they said I was due only a few hundred $. $200+ was all I was reimbursed being bumped from 1st class to economy? Were they kidding? I sent several emails stating my displeasure and disbelief over it. I should have had at least another $500 refund per ticket. They responded to my email finally with some numbers for portions of flights, lame apologies, etc. But their own numbers backed up my assertion that I was woefully under compensated for the refund. If 1st class was only a few hundred $ more than basic economy - I'd fly it every time. But it is not - so why steal from me? They also in their numbers had a larger ticket cost for the economy they 'graciously' put me in on the later flight, causing me to miss the shuttle at LAX and costing me a cab fare now.  When people are rebooked through no fault of their own, the airline either absorbs the cost if it is more, or silently pockets the profit. But in either case the passengers are not asked to make up the difference nor refunded a dime. I was made to pay more for this flight, thereby reducing my refund even more. But even assuming that the higher flight cost is acceptable - AA still owes me 100s of dollars refund per ticket. I am still waiting even after being home almost 2 months, but I suspect they will continue to hide behind fine print and not answering me and nonsense math that truly makes no sense. I gave them several opportunities to be straight with me and try to make things right somehow - but they failed each time. And they are refunding me a pittance of what they should! Their customer service is terrible, their staff lie, and they cheat their passengers. Why would I or anyone fly with them again? I won't fly American Airlines again!  I'll pay more if need be to get more respect and better service, and without lies and hiding from the public they claim to want to serve. Don't waste your time and money with them!Seats had cramped legroom; value was pitiful; they cheat the customers.","{'neg': 0.094, 'neu': 0.834, 'pos': 0.072, 'compound': -0.9745}",-0.9745

We were last in the line and the line was not moving.

When I asked one of the Delta agents and told her there must be some kind of a mistake cause weve been waiting for more than an hour and everyone else from our flight is on the other line she told me its because my husband has a foreign passport and because it has an x written on it so we have to stay in that line. I told her were family of 4 and my 2 kids and i have us passports but she said we have to stay in that line and wait.

When everyone finally left and we came to check out the agent was so rude to me and told me to complain to his boss who was by the way a nice gentleman and when i explained to him that we live in States and my two kids and I have passports and my husband has his Bosnian passport and a green card he then asked if we have shown the Delta agent his green card. I said we didnt because we were never asked for it. He then said that Delta agent shouldve sent us to the faster line because my husband had sufficient docs.

My first thought was I had paid nearly $700 for a one way ticket because I needed to get home in daylight hours to be transported from city into the country area in which I live. I could have easily saved $300 or more by purchasing the late-night tickets but chose not to for transportation conflict. Not only was I told there would be no reimbursement, but also I would not arrive to my Mpls destination until well after midnight. When I asked the gate attendant who was changing my ticket if I could be compensated for the extra money I spent for the early day ticket he said no with a smirk and the only compensation is I'm sorry. His smirky attitude was not helpful to my dilemma. I also explained that I now had to spend well over $200 to get a private driver to take me to my home upon the late arrival. Not only the extra transportation money but the driver was inundated with other requests with other late arrivals on my flight, so after arriving in Minneapolis at 12 30 a.m. I had to wait another hour and a half for the driver to drop other people off.)  After over 5 hour delay in Mobile airport I arrived in Dallas to catch my connection to Minneapolis I found that my American  airlines flight was once again delayed twice. No explanations to why. At this point I had concluded that I would no longer fly on an American Airlines flight again.","{'neg': 0.083, 'neu': 0.894, 'pos': 0.023, 'compound': -0.9695}",-0.9695

Thank you either aircraft controllers or American Airlines. Once we were off the plane (another 10 minutes after waiting on the runway ) we made our way through one customs line where literally 500 hundred people were waiting. We waited in customs for another hour - at this point our plane had already started boarding for Richmond. After making it through the customs checks, there were 6 other customs officers sitting around talking and laughing (twiddling their thumbs) Maybe they could have helped open up more lanes in customs? No - poor management. To add on top of all of this, the one line was full of Miami residents that did not need to make a connecting flight. Maybe they could have opened up a different line for solely connecting flights? No - poor management. After customs we then had to pick up our luggage at baggage claim and recheck our luggage! I get this was American Airlines however this was another wasted 30 minutes. After all of this was said and done all but one American line was open so our so called pre-check passes were useless After talking with a behind the counter representative from American, they would not reimburse us for a hotel or could they guarantee a seat in the next flight to Richmond. After staying the night in Miami on our expense, we arrived to our gate and American Airlines informed us only seat was available and that my wife could go ahead while I had to wait for another flight 10 hours later. But guess what? This was not a guaranteed seat either. Looks like Ill be staying in Miami until the I purchase my own set of tickets again. All in all, this was a nightmare that the airport or American Airlines did not want to admit to their poorly planned schematics of arrivals and connecting flights.

There is very little I can consider as even pleasant about this airport. I have been a KLM Platinum frequent Flyer for the last 8 years and do over 40 flights a year in and out of Manchester to Amsterdam and then onwards through to Asia/US/Europe etc. For the convenience I use Manchester and mainly because of its rail connection between York and the airport (even this has its moments of despair but that's for another day) From the moment I step of the train I see nothing but faces (station platform through to airport security) that are really not interested in what they do and far less interested in people travelling through, in fact ""passengers"" are their nightmare. The Northern rail staff are horrendous, rude and ignorant. Do you know there are no ""TV Screens"" anywhere displaying the departures of trains until you have actually gone through the ticket barrier and entered the platform zone before one can find out the times and destinations of a train ... pathetic, and try asking any of the station staff for that information is as if you have requested them to give you 20. Passing through the ticket barrier on the 24th Oct at about 09:00 hours I counted 10 staff members on the inside of the barrier stood in pairs, my ticket was ""rejected"" by the barrier sensor so the gate remained closed, I tried to draw the attention of a staff member of my predicament, first think I was asked, do you have a valid ticket? Yes Sir I do. ""Let me see it"" by all means Sir, he scrutinised my ticket and said ""Is in order and should work"" Well well well what a surprise, I was instructed to try it again. Nope the barrier remained closed, he called a colleague who also checked my ticket and would you believe it they had to bring in a 3rd fellow with a ""magic key"" to open the barrier, which did not work, and I had to use another barrier and try my ticket again there to no avail, before a new key was introduced and I was eventually allowed to gain entry to the ""railway side of the platforms"" My principle terminal for KLM is T3, probably the longest walk from the station and I mean walk because the travelators' scarcely work, over the past 3 weeks (I have has 6 visit's in this time in and out) there has been a group of ""engineers"" working on them and just yesterday I returned, no engineers and the travelator heading out was inoperative. Just a word of caution on this walkway from station to T1&T3 when it rains the floor is a hazard but to the leaking arch roof. The elevators to get to down from the walkway to the level where T3 pathway are so slow when there are so many users about, I have found an alternative route via T1 arrivals but my word its a straggle. Depends on airline I suppose for check-in but I generally use KLM/AirFrance with a priority pass through ""security"" thankfully but this is another experience in itself, miserable people employed to ensure you don't have liquids, gels, electrical stuff etc. I'm done moaning as I have better things to do but I'm back in to T3 again on Monday 28th Oct with KLM and returning (Airfance 7th Nov) and do you know I'm expecting the same shambles as I have seen for so many years already.

We landed on time in Chicago; however, our gate was occupied, and we sat on the tarmac for over an hour. This delay caused us to miss our next flight to Calgary. Unfortunately, this was my honeymoon, and we will now miss a whole night in Banff National Park. We lost $250 on our hotel for the night. I was so looking forward to this trip as a way to celebrate our love, and arriving under these circumstances was incredibly stressful. Additionally, by the time we arrive today, our car rental company will have closed. We lost all the money on this car and had to rent another one from the airport at a higher price. I am extremely disappointed in American Airlines. I understand that not all circumstances are in the control of the airline, but this situation was. The airline was not able to find a new gate for us, which lead us to sitting on the tarmac for over an hour.  When we did get assigned a new gate, this gate was also not available. Not only is this wasteful and a poor use of resources, it is extremely disrespectful for the patrons of American Airlines. We also asked about American Airlines holding our next flight for 10 minutes, which would have allowed us to make this flight.  Unfortunately, this was also not permitted.  We ended up in gate L10a and our Calgary flight departed from L8.  Once we got to the door, there was no one at the counter. The jetway was still attached to the plane, and we could see luggage being loaded into the cargo hold. Once someone arrived, he would not reopen the door. The flight to Calgary was delayed by 10 minutes. If American Airlines had just held the plane or reopened the door, we would have made the flight.  We literally watched our plane takeoff because the door could not be re-opened. While we were standing at the desk, we could overheat a flight attendant requesting that a door be re-opened for two other passengers, and the request was granted. When we later went to speak with the customer service representative, she was even surprised they would not reopen the door for us, especially since it was an international flight.  I immediately called the phone number given on the flight (due to more than just us missing our flight), and there was 28-32 minute delay.  I will not be flying American Airlines again in the future. I am incredibly disappointed and upset about this experience.  The entire experience was absolutely unacceptable. The customer service was despicable; there is no individuality for customers on this airline. Everyone continually pushed us off to other departments or staff members.

To make matters worse I was board number one and she preboarded her friends on a FULLflight. When I confronted her she became very angry and the situation escalated to the point of her complaining out loud for others to hear to include the rest of my family behind me. She was rude. Inappropriate and unprofessional. This is highly unusual for Southwest. (Been flying them for 30 years. )Called to report incident immediately to customer service and never received a response.

-0.9654,2019-09-01,2019-09-01,10.0,Worst Experience I’ve had With an Airline This Far! Stay Away!,"This is by far the worst airline I have ever flown with. Flew from Baltimore to Chicago Midway with my final destination being Memphis. Got to Chicago and was notified that because of a storm, (which is understandable, no one can control the weather) our flight would be delayed from 7pm to 740. From 740 to 1000pm. Finally 1000pm to 1100pm when they notified us the flight was canceled and all 175 individuals needed to be rebooked. The rebooking process was horrible. There were only 2 individuals working to rebook. Then it became only 1. I waited 2 hours just to rebook. They gave me a flight to Orlando that would ultimately land in Memphis that was supposed to be departing in 15 min. 15min turned to 1 hour which turned to 2. The entire time, the woman working the gate is informing us we don’t have enough flight attendants or a pilot for a SCHEDULED FLIGHT and that we were waiting for a flight to come in and we would be good to go. Finally once that plane departed and was on its way, the whole flight was cancelled. Stood in line another 2 hours to find out the next flight wouldn’t be for another 27 hours and they refused to pay for a hotel stay when I had 1 whole day and 1 whole night before my new flight. No one was allowed to retrieve their checked baggage which hadn’t even made it onto a plane yet and made it seem like it was a BOTHER to them to have to do the work to take it off. Then informed us our bags would be going on to the destination without us, whatever happens to the bag once it gets there happens, and hopefully they’ll be there when we or if we get there because many people booked return flights back home or with another airline. The customer service was awful, the people were rude, in compassionate to people who had fully booked vacations and genuinely did not care to help. They rolled their eyes and kept speaking to us as if “there was nothing else they could do.” I would never recommend this airline and I will not be flying with this airline ever again.

Departure time was 1:55pm, arriving BUR at 3:10pm. At 12:32pm, I received a text message from Southwest with a new departure time (3:05pm). Then within minutes another text from them with a departure time of 4:00pm. A few minutes later another text with departure time change of 3:30pm. Then, minutes after that, another text that the flight was cancelled. Absolutely unacceptable! There were NO weather issues in San Francisco at the time. The agent at the gate said it was ""likely due to weather, possibly regarding the aircraft that was arriving from another airport"".  That is hard to believe, since the flight was cancelled less than 2 hours before departure from SFO. Also, it couldn't possibly be a mechanical issue because the aircraft we were supposed to be boarding wasn't at the gate, and because it was so close to our scheduled departure time, the aircraft supposedly coming from another location had to have either already been in flight, or never left the ground. This is Christmas Eve. Most people flying on this day have very important commitments and family gatherings. There was no offer to fly on another airline. No other Southwest flights were apparently available to depart out of SFO. There was NO compensation offered, not even shuttle service to another airport. The only option for me was to get rerouted to Las Vegas then from LAS to BUR. The SFO-LAS flight didn't depart until 4:55pm and connecting flight got me into BUR at 9:15pm! That's 6 hours later than when I needed to arrive.  I was unable to see family members I have not seen in over 2 years due to completely missing a very special holiday gathering. It was the ONLY time I could have seen these family members, and I missed it. It will likely be another 1 to 2 years before I will see them again.  This is tragic, and all because (I came to find out) Air Traffic Control instructed Southwest to cancel this flight on Christmas Eve within less than 2 hours of departure.  So, it was an issue with air traffic, not weather.  ATC cancelled this flight probably due to departing and arriving aircraft congestion at SFO.  I never received any communication from Southwest about this. Not a word of apology, nothing about the reason for this cancellation, not a single offer of compensation.  I will tell you that in the future, I will NOT book a holiday flight with Southwest Airlines again. My experience that day was unreal, and has left me with a devastating loss of a missed opportunity to be with family.","{'neg': 0.089, 'neu': 0.876, 'pos': 0.034, 'compound': -0.9652}",-0.9652

Since my routes have changes to ""United friendly"" I spent remaining AA Advantage miles for a WSJ one-year subscription last November - result: no contact, no word, no newspaper. In January, called Advantage service, who gave me a different number for the entity that handles its miles for magazines operation. This resulted in leaving a message with them, followed by an email from a ""do not reply"" address telling me the subscription period had been reset, and my first edition would arrive in two weeks. ONE paper did arrive on the predicted date, followed by nothing. Another call produced another email in which an apology was made, and a new date specified. The new date arrived with delivery of that day's WSJ. The following three days saw no newspaper delivered. By this time I had acquired an email for the miles for mags AA operation, and sent a summary of this disappointing experience. The next day, I received an email saying the delivery would resume the next day - however, it also gave me a phone number for the publisher's delivery organization, and advised me to call that number if I experienced any further delivery problems. It came as no surprise that I received a paper the next day, and nothing the following day. My phone call to this new organization included delay from them having difficulty finding any record of my subscription; then an advisement that I had been ""credited"" one day for the missed delivery.  One might opine that, at this point, why complain about American Airlines - the action has moved through other ""players"" - My response is that AA solicited my miles for the WSJ subscription, and then dumped me into a rabbit hole wherein AA's end of the agreement isn't being delivered. It isn't right (especially if you multiply this experience by tens of thousands of others) and I will spend my travel dollar elsewhere in future airline travel (even where an AA route is most convenient.)","{'neg': 0.104, 'neu': 0.845, 'pos': 0.051, 'compound': -0.965}",-0.965

A pyramid scheme of a company with executive salaries through the roof at the expense of everyone else, including passengers. I have flown all over the world on many different airlines and, I must say, most American airlines are of inferior quality compared with the majority of others in the world - including budget carriers. The last time I flew Delta from JFK, the seats and isles were the narrowest, to the point of being hazardous, that I have ever seen.  Also, my girlfriend and I went out of our way to arrive at the gate on time. We had to compensate for unusual transit delays on the subway and thus ran 25 gates (about 1.2 miles) to the departure gate only to find upon arriving at the gate that departure was delayed over an hour and ZERO mention of this was made on the app or the scheduling screens in JFK. FINALLY, we boarded and it took forever because, like most American airlines , Delta has a RIDICULOUS AND MENTALLY DEGENERATE boarding process and baggage handling policy. Gone are the days, in America, of intelligent boarding from the back AND front doors - all passengers must wait in ridiculous lines and funnel into a single entrance and wait while fumbling, confused travelers struggle to shove their larger and larger ‘carry on’ bags. This is because Delta wants to save money in baggage handling and in order to check a bag you have to pay, so, everyone carries on. Talk about a bad policy! American carriers and companies in general are supposed to be THE BEST at ‘capitalism’, yet, they fail miserably to provide the most basic satisfactory services in a graceful non-ugly way. No first class company would make customers get out their wallets for 100 different basic necessities on a trip - bag check, food, baggage carts(American airports) etc. The list goes on when, instead it should be complimentary and built into the fare or , as reality may be, taken out of executives’ huge salaries. So ugly, so greedy these people. As if they need more government subsidies! Delta paid ZERO federal income tax last year. When a company can’t figure out how to make the majority of customers happy AND make a profit, there is a big problem. Either it is greedy executives or bad management and ‘herd mentality’ business practices. Probably all three and then some! Shame on Delta’s greedy, incompetent leaders for failing utterly to live up to their brands own standards.","{'neg': 0.127, 'neu': 0.793, 'pos': 0.081, 'compound': -0.9645}",-0.9645

(Are you kidding me. That’s so illegal) then the lady informed her that’s no reason to preboard and she needs to figure it out. I was blown away by that as i was getting coffee when my wife asked. (She wanted me to be proud of her for getting the courage and asking herself for i normally do) the staff denied it of course and my wife not wanting to make a scene proceeded to tell me not to worry about it. So there we are and I’m tending to my 3 children and my wife paralyzed by fear as we walk up and hand the agent all of our boarding passes. He literally paused and looked at me and asked if i could hear. I said what? He said i just stated that all passengers must be holding their own boarding pass which i reply. I’m sorry i didn’t hear. It’s not a big deal i can give them to my children. Which he must have thought i was being confrontational as he stared at me silently as if he wanted to engage in physical combat. It was an awkward minute that passed as he took his time holding up the line to make his point and he made sure the passengers behind us knew it was our fault the line was held up. While this is going on my poor wife’s situation is worsening. We boarded our plane and will not be recommending southwest to anyone which is a bummer cause I’m normally a southwest snob. I could not believe the way we were treated and no one should ever be treated like that. Especially if they have a disability.

I understand the theory of having to wind your way through duty free after the undermanned under resourced security area and the miles of cattle fencing for check-in. I was told off for not using it even when it was empty. (we are forced to check in mega early for these reasons). We wont mention the bars full of drunks first thing in a morning.

It goes without saying that until this experience, I was a die-hard loyal Southwest customer.On November 20th, 2019, my husband and I were arriving back in the U.S. after a week-long honeymoon. We had experienced amazing service with every other airline we'd flown with, including Singapore Air and Korean Air. Knowing that I'd always experienced great service with Southwest, I wasn't expecting to run into issues at LAX following nearly 30 hours of travel. Unfortunately, Southwest gave us nothing but problems.We attempted to check our bags in as soon as we arrived, but were told we needed to wait until 4 hours before our departure time, which was at 1:05 pm. While we were there, we discussed earlier flight time availability with the customer service representative. During this conversation, we were told nothing of flight delays or cancellations. We decided to keep our afternoon flight and checked two bags with them at 9:10 am. After going through security, we checked the departures board only to see that every flight from LAX to LAS prior to ours had been canceled. We were concerned and went to talk to the representative at our gate for more information. She told us flights were being delayed and canceled due to rainstorms. Then she got rather snarky with us when we asked for more information about the weather and said ""Obviously, lightning isn't good for planes."" Yes, we know...we're not children - we just want to know if we'll be able to make it home after almost two days of not showering and getting almost zero sleep.Our flight was canceled just after 10:00 am. We went back to the gate to talk with different representatives. We told them we were going to drive to Vegas and could they please give us a refund since they canceled the flight and we need the money to rent a car. They told us they don't offer refunds for flights canceled due to weather. Really? No one is denying that the weather is no one's fault, but why should we have to pay for a service we won't receive? We aren't getting on another flight because we have to get home by a certain time. We have to rent a car and drive 4 hours to Vegas due to this cancellations. Give us our money back!My husband and I asked for our checked bags back. The representatives at the gate told us they would be in baggage claim. We went to baggage claim. No bags. The Southwest employees in baggage claim said they would be at carousel 1. After 20 minutes, still no bags. We went back to their office and talked to them. They said they didn't know how long it would take for them to give us our bags. Essentially, it was a ""It could be 30 minutes or 4 hours. We don't know."" Excuse me? We checked our bags less than 2 hours ago, and you're telling me you won't be able to find them for up to 4 hours? Why? Oh, you don't know that either. Okay, cool.They offer to put our bags on the next flight at 4:15 pm to arrive in Vegas after 6:00. They type our names into their computer and write down our information and reassure us that they will put in a formal request for our bags to be delivered to our home in Las Vegas. Then they give me the number for the Southwest baggage claim department in LAS. Cool, thanks.We rent the car (shout out to Enterprise who took great care of us!) and make the hike to Vegas. On the way, I call the number the Southwest reps gave us in LA. It's not their sister baggage claim department; it's the number for the lost and found office in McCarran Airport. The helpful woman on the phone did what she could to help me, but ultimately informed me that Southwest is known for being extremely unhelpful and that she wasn't surprised I was given the wrong number. ""They don't want to deal with you,"" she said. Awesome. Fortunately, she patched me through to the Southwest baggage claim office. No one answered, so I left a message. An hour later, I receive a call back from a woman who assured me she would keep an eye out for our bags and give me a call back once they arrived. She gave me the direct number for their office. By 10:00 pm, we had been safely in our home for several hours and all my dozens of calls and messages to their baggage claim remained unanswered. Finally, I receive a call from Beth.Beth says my bags aren't there. In fact, not only are they not in Las Vegas, the Southwest representatives who supposedly typed all our information into their computer didn't do anything. There was zero intention for our bags to be sent anywhere. They were going to stay in LAX indefinitely.Beth was awesome - she not only created a report for our bags (something the LAX reps were apparently supposed to do and simply chose not to), she put a rush on them to be on the very first plane out to Vegas. She also contacted the next-shift supervisor, Raven, and put in a request for a courtesy home delivery because, as she said, ""This wasn't your fault and you shouldn't be punished for someone else's mistake."" Thank you, Beth, we feel the exact same way and we appreciate that you understand where we're coming from!The next morning, I received a voicemail from the LAS Southwest baggage claim office. ""Your bags are here and ready to be picked up!""I spend the next few hours calling the number I was given by the first baggage claim rep, as well as calling the McCarran Airport operator to have them transfer me to the Southwest baggage claim office extension. I left several messages on both machines to no avail. Finally, by 12:30 pm, I was just over the entire situation and drove the 45 minutes from my home to the airport to pick up the bags. I paid for parking and walked into the Southwest baggage claim office.Up to this point, I had been excusing their office for lack of communication by telling myself and my husband that there must not be many people working in the office at any given point in time and that they are most likely fielding multiple calls and in-person customers simultaneously, making it less likely for reps to get back to me in a timely manner. Yet, when I walked into the Southwest baggage claim, I saw no fewer than 5 employees working in the office. 1 employee was standing outside the door of the office. 2 of them were helping one couple with a lost bag report. The employee who ended up working with me was walking in from her break, and the supervisor was in his office. After calling dozens of times and leaving almost as many messages and receiving almost no callbacks for nearly 24 hours at this point, I was absolutely livid.Trying to keep my composure, I asked Kylie, the representative who had walked in, if I could have my bags. She pointed to a group outside the office window. ""Are any of those yours?"" she asked. ""No,"" I said, getting angrier by the minute. She led me to another group outside the office and gestured to them. ""No!"" I was getting even more upset. We finally located my bags in their storage office and I asked to speak to her supervisor.I overheard another rep tell Kylie that he was in his office watching a web video. When he came out, I detailed my entire awful experience that I'd had with Southwest. They looked up my information on their computer and saw that the supervisor on the morning shift, Raven, had actually confirmed a courtesy bag delivery to our home that morning when the bags arrived. Yet no one had even thought to look before calling me to tell me to pick them up or even respond to my voicemails all morning. Now I was enraged.This is completely unacceptable. Not only that, it's utterly flabbergasting. I have spent my entire adult life and much of my childhood flying Southwest. I have berated people for choosing other airlines over Southwest because I've always believed Southwest to be the best domestic airline currently available. Now I doubt I will ever fly Southwest again.You refused to issue a refund for something we should absolutely have been refunded. I know it's not Southwest's fault that the weather was bad. But you know what? It wasn't our fault either, and to hold our money hostage when you refuse to provide a service that we already paid for is ludicrous. You refused to give us back our property when we demanded it. If you are canceling all your flights prior to us checking our bags in, why aren't you prepared to cancel our flight as well and have those bags in an easy-to-access location when it happens? We were not the only people in the LAX baggage claim office demanding our bags back so we could drive to Las Vegas. There were several groups attempting the same. You withheld our property for an indeterminate amount of time for no reason whatsoever.You refused to aid us in any way, first by not putting our bags on the next flight, as promised, and second by giving me contact information that was incorrect because, as I now believe wholeheartedly, you simply ""didn't want to deal with [us]."" You had no problem leaving our bags where you left them after we checked in earlier that morning because you just didn't care.You returned my calls twice in 24 hours. I left more messages than I can count and called even more times than that. The ""direct"" number I was given did NOT work. I now know the names of several of McCarran's operators because that was the only way I could get ahold of you, and yet, of the 5 people working in the Southwest baggage claim office at any given point in time, no one had the mere courtesy or respect to call me back.You didn't do your jobs by taking a look at my information before calling me. You assumed that because the bags were there that your job was complete. You forced me to drive an hour and a half out of my way after spending nearly 2 days traveling from the other side of the world and unexpectedly driving 4 hours to get home the day before. You couldn't be bothered with treating my husband and I like the good customers we have always been to you. This is not customer service. I feel utterly disserviced and disrespected on all fronts. The only people I commend at Southwest are Beth and Raven, who obviously know how to do their jobs. Everyone else, including the 5 employees in LAS who worked in the office on the afternoon of Thursday, November 21st, 2019 and the 4 employees who worked in the LAX office on the morning of Wednesday, November 20th, 2019 should be fired, or at the very least, reprimanded.Almost everything we experienced with Southwest over the last few days could have been easily avoided. Instead, you now have many people who will be avoiding your airline as much as possible for the foreseeable future. We will tell everyone we know about how poorly we were treated by Southwest and how horrible our experience with you was. I'm incredibly disappointed and upset by this. If you're a fellow customer reading this, please don't ever use Southwest for any of your important travel. Wedding, honeymoon, funeral, anniversary, birthday, holiday - whatever. They don't know how to do their jobs properly and they don't care about you. All they care about is money in their pocket and butts in seats, and that's all any of us is to them.","{'neg': 0.08, 'neu': 0.848, 'pos': 0.072, 'compound': -0.9635}",-0.9635

In that such critical situation, they forced us to spend extra $$$$, otherwise we would be stuck in Europe and they didn't care! When we got home, we tried to call them. They said because when we bought that new flight, the original flight wasn't cancelled yet so they would only refund part of the original/cheaper flight (only $$$). On the 21 of March, the original flight was finally canceled, so they said they would refund our original flight instead of our emergency flight ($$$$).

I should read more details.The upcharge to go first class over regular was $1,000 or 500 per seat; so what did we get for our money?Well, the flights to New Mexico were ok. The planes were old 737's, so nothing special. We had priority check-in in Tampa, but then had a gate and terminal change in Dallas. The meal was ok, and while not plush, the seats were comfortable.Returning from New Mexico was a disaster. There was no first class check in, but that's more of the airport's fault. The plane was another old 737, but at least it was clean. We landed in Dallas with a 3 hour layover. Of course there was another AA terminal and gate change, so we transferred and found a good restaurant to wait. After 30 minutes, there was another gate change. Then another with terminal change. So after we ate, we moved to the appropriate gate.Something was odd at the gate, as we were delayed getting on the plane. After 15 extra minutes they finally started loading. We were first on, then waited as the plane filled. No drinks were offered while we sat, so I knew something was up. One of the pilots kept coming out of the cockpit, playing with his mustache, then looking at the back of the plane. It was making me nervous. After half an hour, they announced the plane had a hydraulic leak and needed further inspection. After another half hour, they told us to get off the plane.

I'm surprised it took that long to figure out it was unsafe.We waited another half an hour and they announced a new plane, but it was at  another terminal. The same terminal where we arrived from New Mexico! So off we went, going back to where we started. Upon arrival, we waited for the new plane and old crew to catch up. Another 30 minutes went by, and we saw the pilots go into the plane walkway. Then 5 minutes later they were back. Again the nervous pilot played with his mustache, looked at the crowd, then both pilots left the area. Apparently, they had exceeded their flying hours for the day. On the ground. Without ever taking off, they were going home. How nice.So, they boarded us anyway. This time, they did serve a few drinks while we waited on a new crew.

When I finally get to the counter, the staff informs me sorry but you've missed it by a few minutes so you can't get on the flight now. You can try calling this number to get a waiver because the queue was long. I call the number crying because my friends have now left for their flight and I am left alone but the service lady on the other side either does not pick up on it or does not care. She snaps at me multiple times, expresses no empathy nor sympathy for my situation, and is obviously impatient. I'm just asking for help; decency is free. My original flight is wasted. I have to pay an extra US$200 for a new flight at another airport. All this time I am trying to pull myself together crouched in a corner I keep getting shooed from my spot because apparently I am standing at an inappropriate location even though I am not blocking nor inconveniencing anybody. Later I find out that my friends missed their flight too because they waited too long for me. Guess who's sitting at the other airport now typing this.

-0.9557,2019-08-01,2019-08-01,10.0,Warning if you have to travel with a pet!,"I wanted to write this to warn others considering AA Pet services.  I wrote the company detailing my experiences and I have not received any kind of response.  This is a VERY abbreviated letter I sent to them.  My trip was from JFK to San Diego.  This all happened pre-covid. I have shipped pets before, so I know things must be done perfectly and had all required paperwork properly completed.  I used the website for pet requirements, had questions, and called the 1800 number. I got a very terse woman who told me she knew absolutely nothing about shipping pets and proceeded to read the ENTIRE website to me.  I called someone else and got the info I needed. Strike 1.The instructions told me the time and place to go to.  I was there in plenty of time.  After waiting 30 minutes for the VERY SLOW employee, someone else told me I was in the wrong place.  I was exactly where the instructions told me to be.  They said I was, but I should be somewhere else and this “happens all the time”.  Strike 2.This is where things REALLY turn nasty.  We got to the correct building and there was this person by the name of Yvette.  She proceeded to tell me I was too late.  I tried to show her what the problem was and that I was sent to the wrong place.  To make the story short – basically it was all my fault that I was sent to the wrong place and it WAS NOT her problem.  The supervisor, who was only ever referred to as ‘the supervisor”, came out to tell me the same thing and that it wasn’t their fault. There were raising their voices and, not to exacerbate the situation, I assumed the role of the grown-up and professional.  All they did was shout that it wasn’t their fault and not their problem.  Strike 3.I work in customer service and if I had EVER treated a paying customer like that, I would have been fired on the spot and probably thrown out into the street – and I would have deserved it!  There was absolutely no effort to try and find a solution to the problem, or even listen to the problem. This is an indicator of poor senior leadership, where employees are afraid for their jobs and are quick to shift blame instead of finding a solution.  I had to call the 800 number again to rebook and I showed up 4 hours early.  I was working with another employee who was very helpful until Yvette showed up again and said ‘Oh – you were here yesterday’.  Yes, in fact, I was.  The supervisor showed up and had cooled off enough to have a civil conversation.  Since I was finally able to get a word in edgewise, I explained to him what happened the day before and he was receptive to my explanation and then turned very civil and helpful.  He even complimented me on how level headed I was the day before.  I told him that acting like a jerk never solves anything, which Yvette could learn something from.We were moving along, until the note from the vet about temperature requirements.  As clearly stated on the website and the instruction email I received, that paper was required after May 1, and through certain cities, neither of which applied to my situation.That is when Yvette interjected herself and said ‘the customer doesn’t state what is required – we do’.  Now I need this other paper from the vet, just because Yvette says so.  It was as though she was doing everything she could do to make what was already a difficult process almost impossible for me. It took the vet a while to fax it.  Yvette sat there scowling at me and finally disappeared when it started looking like things were going to work out.  That is disgusting behavior from an employee.  The supervisor went along with all of this.  Who was in charge? – is what I ask.In San Diego, I went to the baggage assistance to find out where to pick up my cats.  I was told where to wait and that it would be a while. Pets were coming out, the employee there kept assuring me they would be coming.  After about 2 hours and watching pets come out from flights well after mine, AA Cargo called me and told me my cats had been there for 2 hours and where was I?  I said I was right where I was told to be.  Well – once again I was given the wrong place and I was supposed to be at the other end of another terminal.  I went to the cargo area and I explained to the gentleman behind the counter the situation and he said that ‘happens all the time and they should change it’.  Well – yeah!  But these men were nice, helpful, gave me some bottles of water for my cats and said they wished there was more they could do.  THAT is what customer service looks like.  Yvette could learn something here.Believe me - this is the very short version of what happened.  I cannot believe the treatment of a paying customer, and the level of service being given.  I fly all the time.  There are so many excellent choices out there.  With the unnecessary aggravation and drama, not to mention the added expenses of this experience and non-response to my complaint letter, I can’t think of any reason to EVER fly American Airlines again.","{'neg': 0.092, 'neu': 0.833, 'pos': 0.075, 'compound': -0.9557}",-0.9557

My wife, daughter son and I (30 year frequent flyer members of SW) had reservations to fly to Panama City Beach for Thanksgiving. My wife and daughter left on the Monday prior, and my son and I were due to leave the following Tuesday morning from Denver. Heavy snow cancelled our flights on Tuesday. I re-booked for later that day, but this flight was also cancelled. Our flight had a stop in Dallas, and so I called Southwest to see if they could get us to Dallas on Tuesday night, (There were available flights listed). I would pay for a hotel on Tuesday night and we'd fly to Panama City early Wednesday morning. Southwest said no. Travel had to be completed in one day. I asked why and the answer was ""It's our policy"". Never a good justification. They said the agents at the airport might be able to split the flight that way, but they couldn't. They said I'd have to go to the airport and ask. I suggested maybe they could call the agents at the airport rather than have me drive an hour in the snow to perhaps be turned down. They said they couldn't do that. I kept trying and finally got a hold of someone at their corporate offices. After another hour of begging, (honestly, we just wanted to be together as a family at Thanksgiving) the rep said they'd do it. However....since we were booking what they considered a ""new flight"" on such short notice on a holiday, the flight to Dallas from Denver would cost each of us more than $1,000 a piece. Our original flights were all booked with frequent flyer miles, and there was no way we could afford to do this. I'm certain someone will attempt to take down this post within minutes, but y'all need to know that the image Southwest has worked so hard to cultivate, no longer lives.

One of the few negative experiences I’ve had on Southwest occurred last month. We were sitting on the plane in Philadelphia for a flight to Chicago when the pilot informed us all flights to Chicago were on hold due to bad weather in Chicago and we would be sitting at the gate for about 30 until the next weather update. 30 minutes later, the pilot told us there would be more lengthy delays on this flight and said all passengers need to get off the plane. Turns out this flight to Chicago had already been cancelled (as confirmed by two flight attendants and a gate agent) but the pilot chose not to tell us this. Why not be honest and transparent with your customers? Was the pilot afraid of a negative reaction so he wanted to get the passengers off the plane before they learned the flight was cancelled? Because of the flight cancellation, we had to get a hotel room (not paid for by Southwest) in Philadelphia and take a flight the next morning. In my experience, people tend to react better to bad news when told the truth rather than something less than the truth.

We sat for more than 1 hour besides the belts, until the last bag finally came out. It took me 3 hours to fly from Panama to Orlando and incredibly it took me more than 4 hours to try to go out of the Airport. These guys have no idea of customer experience.

We arrived on a surprisingly sparsely populated flight from London, a ten hour flight on which we were able to lie across three seats each - we thought we were lucky! (In retrospect, it seems other travellers have, perhaps, learned the lesson from experiencing what we were were just about to endure - and they found alternative routes). Plodding the long route to Immigration brought us to a large hall where we were confronted with, probably, 20 modern, state-of-the-art, passport-reading, data-collection machines. It is apparent from 95% of all the passengers being directed to the snake-queue (with a cross on the machines print-outs) illustrate that these state-of-the-art machine were as much use as a chocolate tea pot! I estimate that there were 300 passengers in the queue (line) for immigration and only two of the immigration desks were open. 2 hours later we emerged from this inefficient, utterly farcical process, to rush on to Baggage Reclaim to retrieve our luggage for onward travel. All the carousels were stopped, little in the way of a clue which group of off-loaded bags might contain ours. 10 more minutes wasted. With just less than an hour left we rushed off to check-in our bags. Scanning the labels affixed in London we were then told that our flight to Pensacola (21:30) was delayed until the next morning. (This is not any definition of delay with which I have been previously aware: the flight was cancelled, cynically categorise as delayed, without any regard for the inconvenience to us, United Airlines customers, or for those who were travelling to meet us.) As with others reviews, finding a member of staff to provide any help, reassurance or information was nigh on impossible as we passed through to this point. The staff directing us just weret interested in our concerns at the speed of the queue/processing: indeed they said that we should complain to the immigration officer - see how we got on! We did: its all because of the reallocation of staff to the Mexican border, we were told. Seems to me that the technology employed to replace the immigration officers is unfit for purpose, the immigration management team are not fit for purpose. Please dont think that this inconvenient, inconsiderate, inept system is only foisted on aliens (from outside the US) there were US citizens with us in this queue as a result of the ineffective, technologically defective equipment. In conclusion, reviews on this website of the Houston Airports customers seem to indicate that our flight was only 30% populated because those in the know have found another airline/hub airport to use in preference to this shambolic shower. It is fair to point out that after queuing for another 40 minutes, we spent a further 40 minutes being processed - we were provided accommodation at the local Holiday Inn and food vouchers - and a flight ticket to continue our journey the next morning. Interestingly, our onward flight was completely full - accommodating passengers whos earlier flight had been cancelled. After this trip, we will not fly by United Airlines to George Bush Airport again. George Bush Airport management need to recognise and address these problems before they lose their rest of their passengers to others.","{'neg': 0.081, 'neu': 0.869, 'pos': 0.05, 'compound': -0.9424}",-0.9424

We were worried, so every airport employee we met on our way, we informed about our connection and certified if there was no way of rushing our pass. All of them told us not to worry, the flight atendents were aware of our delay.Not to mention the distance of our new gate, we had to run, no providence was taken from the company, no one to help us, NOTHING. Even better, once we got there, we had to hear from one of the check in attendents a pissed off speach as if we were late for any personal reasons (not the case).We were in a good mood, going to our honeymoon trip, so we let it go, things happens, right?BUT there are limits, and we were not travelling for FREE, opposite of that, we paid a lot. On our way back, it was worse. When tha plane arrived at the gate for our surprise, OH YEAH a waiting line to park the plane  we thought, ""not again"". There was no gate available, so they switched to another gate but yep, we waited for more than 40 minutes, and guess what?? WE paid the price, yes we had to run A LOT from gate D28 (or more) to the gate D3, not to lose the flight, instead of having the support of the company (maybe pick us up with those mini buggie or any other provision), we had to RUN and hear our names being called on the speaker saing they would not wait. Once we got to gate, actually my husband got before, because I was almost fanting from running, and he had to hear from the attendes a scold and the following: ""your wife has five minutes to get here, or else we wont wait"". No shame?  REALLY AMERICAN AIRLINES??

Finally my zone was called, there were only 4-5 passengers in that zone and as soon as agent announced boarding for our zone, the front of the line was barricaded and I was told that all of us will have to forget about carry-on luggage (irrespective of the size) as there is no space left in the air craft. On top pf that they said that the carry on will only be given back to us at final destination and will be transported as checked luggage. I was totally shocked and protested that I need the carry on with me as I will be flying for next 15 hours. After all there is a reason why someone carries valuables in the carry on but as soon as I argued with their staff, they pulled me on one side and and said - Take his luggage off, he is not flying. I pleaded with them to keep carry on bag in aircraft & hand it over to me at Atlanta while exiting the aircraft so that I can carry it with me during next flight to South America but nope. The only reply i got was what is your number, you are being off loaded etc etc. Even telling them repeatedly that my final destination is next day away and in another continent made no difference at all.it goes without saying that airline staff had stared the boarding quite late so flight was already late by few minutes, everyone else had already boarded so it became a brain numbing situation. For once I thought about cancelling the flight but most of hotel reservations were non refundable. As I was still in a state of shock and trying to reason with extremely rude Delta staff at Pearson airport, they told me that they are closing the plane door so I will have to take the snap decision - fly without carry on till my final destination or not fly at all. Due to panic and threats I could not even think of taking out important items from carry on with the result that as soon as plane took off, I realized I had left my wallet with money and credit cards in the outer, unlocked pocket of carry on. The rest of the money, phones etc, were also in the carry on which of course was not locked. It was a nightmare to think what would happen if I land in a new country, a continent away, with no money or credit card or phone.This is how I traveled for almost 15 hours before reuniting with my carry on and its valuables. What a great start to a vacation.I travel frequently but this is first time in 30 years that this kind of terrible heavy handedness was belted out to me.So my question is - Is this common practice with Delta Airline and specially by their Toronto staff?","{'neg': 0.079, 'neu': 0.868, 'pos': 0.053, 'compound': -0.9345}",-0.9345

Everything just got worst from there. The first excuse was weather, although my flight was early in the morning when no weather was affecting the area yet. I was rebooked twice and each time, the flights were cancelled. Once the Airlines say the word weather, the traveler is thrown under the bus, and is treated pure disrespect. No clear answers, and left to accept what the airline rebook for you, or figure out a new best way to get to your time sensitive location. On this day a watched a airline meltdown. Travelers plans were destroyed and no compensation was offered. Shame on Southwest!!! If I did not act swiftly I would not have arrived on time to get to my birthday cruise. I immediately had to book a flight with American Airlines, at O’Hare Airport, which cost me hundreds of dollars out of my budgeted trip. The icing on the cake, was the lie I was told about my luggage. I was refused the ability to get my luggage from Southwest, even thought they cancelled all most all the fights at the end of the night. They told me my luggage would be sent on the next plane out in the morning. This never happened; once I arrived on my American Airline flight, I went to Southwest baggage claim, where a received the news that my baggage would not make it in time for my cruise. They offered me $600 to go shopping, at 3:00, for a cruise I had to on, bo later then 4:00 pm. So I am on my cruise with no clothes to change in.

The airport is really badly laid out as well with the need to go up and stairs or using escalators several times on the way. The direction signs are poor and not always readily visible. The Fast Track facility was heavily overloaded - it was almost quicker to use the standard facility for your hand luggage control and the staff are not particularly helpful or friendly and the standards seem to change each time one goes through in terms of what needs to be removed from your hand luggage to be controlled separately! Why this is the case is difficult to comprehend. Passage through the airport once one is through immigration etc. is like slaloming on overcrowded ski slopes. Quite frankly there is nothing positive to say about this airport which seems to get worse each time we have to through it!

The supervisor never took his eyes off of me during the entire examination. Right or wrong, I feel like I was selected for the ""full Monty"" treatment because I am an older white male.

Last year we flew Delta through FLL and found a very irritable Delta staff at D8 gate. We arrived at the gate in wheelchairs and decided to give them up and walk down the ramp to board the aircraft. When pre-boarding began we started down the ramp and was stopped by one of the staff and were refused preboarding because we did not have wheelchairs. This January 26th we were sent to gate D6 to board and the same group of staff were working that corner of the terminal so we knew better than give up our wheelchairs. Delta had put two departing flights in that corner of the terminal that would both board and leave at the same time. When it got close to boarding time naturally both gates filled with passengers to a point where both arriving flights had problems offloading. The staff lined up 18 wheelchairs at our gate including my wife and I. The mob of people was crazy and in a hurry to board as if it was first come first serve boarding. Our gate announced that there would be a 3-hour delay and our new flight time would be 4:00 PM. Delta needed a part for the plane and would have to be flown in from Atlanta to be installed. We along with 200 other passengers inquired about our connecting flights in Atlanta where we were flying too and where the part was coming from. Some were found other flights and some like us had to wait and were given alternate connections. At 4:00 we boarded the plane and the ""EXIT"" sign was installed. Then the crew happened to remember after 3 hours that some of the luggage had to come off of the plane and be sent to other planes which passengers had been given. So for 30 minutes more they unloaded all the luggage, sorted out the few pieces that belonged on other planes and reloaded the remaining luggage. We were finally on our way to ATL. We arrived with 10 minutes to swap to our alternate flights because we had missed our original flights. The Delta staff member in ATL had only sent 12 wheelchairs all for baggage claim. People were scrambling to find wheelchairs but there was no one to push them in Concourse A. We were heading to Concourse E and did not even have wheelchairs on our alternate flight listing. We had now missed our alternate flight to BNA. The attendant at the gate we landed at gave us another alternate flight to BNA via Concourse E. We had now 30 minutes to get to E and no wheelchairs. That's when a young girl found us chairs and after a while found another girl to help push us part of the way. They found another person to replace the other girl and we barely made that flight. Through the whole process, Delta employees just did not care about us. The employee in FLL did not process our assistance request and the Delta employee in ATL did not try to assist with transportation. Next time it will not be Delta that we fly.","{'neg': 0.05, 'neu': 0.933, 'pos': 0.016, 'compound': -0.9316}",-0.9316

They have no idea (and they obviously dont care) that passengers who enter using Global Entry have already gone through extensive background checks, finger-printing and biometric security clearances. The whole point of using Global Entry is to already answer such questions as do you have anything to declare via the automated kiosks and to confirm one is a trusted traveler. Yet without exception, San Diego Immigration Officers demand one hand over ones passport and Global Entry receipt, they take an interrogative attitude, study the passport at their leisure and demand to know if one bought anything or has anything to declare! The whole point of answering the questions at the kiosk is so there is no need to be interviewed by an Immigration Officer! Every airport in America has fast track lanes where Global Entry passengers automatically walk right through, immigration and customs officials simply take the Global Entry receipt, no stopping, no demanding one hand over ones passport, no questions asked. Clearly, San Diego immigration Officers do not want to accept the fast track part of Global Entry as a way to justify their existence to heavy-handedly screen passengers arriving on what is a minute number of daily international arrivals. Almost without exception, they act more like intimidating prison guards and management obviously allows them to act like this with impunity. This practice is unwarranted, unacceptable and completely defeats the entire purpose of the Global Entry vetting process. Another completely overreaching, baseless practice San Diego International Arrivals Customs requires is for passengers to queue up after they have passed through immigration and collected their luggage and have all their luggage x-rayed again before they can exit the airport! No other airport x-rays luggage after one arrives at ones destination! This is such typical San Diego small-minded, provincial mentality. As if pre-flight x-ray screening of luggage from international flights is less rigorous than pre-flight x-ray screening of luggage on domestic flights? How arrogant and uninformed. San Diego wants so badly to grow its international flight business, but it will never be an international airport with the immigration and customs practices they are using. With the above practices, it will remain a back-water, regional little airport staffed by amateurs who relish the idea that they are in positions of power and want to bully people. It is far better to fly out of LAX, SFO or Phoenix where the international immigration and customs teams understand their jobs.","{'neg': 0.089, 'neu': 0.871, 'pos': 0.04, 'compound': -0.9257}",-0.9257

I now have to account for an extra half hour (minimum) delay for both arrivals and departures. I understand growth of an area creates difficulties, but the area has experienced continuous, foreseeable growth for decades. The inability to accommodate this growth at the airport is a clear sign of poor management and this should be addressed. Top down changes are needed. Anyone in a leadership role who believes that this airport is on the right path, as busses drive people to planes, departures are delayed due to runway availability, and arrivals sit and wait for gates to open, needs to be fired and replaced by someone with a realistic view of the problems facing the airport. Solutions are needed and no new restaurant or international terminal will rectify the disaster that has become SeaTac airport.","{'neg': 0.156, 'neu': 0.742, 'pos': 0.103, 'compound': -0.9224}",-0.9224

We booked Business Select tickets from Nassau to Providence with a stop in Baltimore. It was supposed to depart at 4:10 PM. We knew they were expecting bad weather in Baltimore so we were checking the flight status all morning. At about 1, I received a text stating the flight from Baltimore (not Nassau) was cancelled. I called customer service and their suggestion was to get to Baltimore and then figure out how to get home from there. We checked in at Nassau ~3 hours before departure and were told we weren't flying that day. Apparently the entire trip was cancelled. A few minutes later, I get another text stating we're rebooked on a flight the next day with a ~8 hour layover in Ft. Lauderdale. Neither my wife or I could miss work the next day so we told them we had to get to Baltimore and would rent a car and drive home if necessary. It would have been a rough ~7 hour trip in rain/sleet/snow but we didn't have a choice. I reserved a car at that point. After much waiting around, they rebooked us on the same Baltimore flight but this time it was on Wanna Get Way tickets. At no point we were told this. I specifically paid top dollar for the Business Select tickets for a few reasons, including the ability to board early so our family could sit together. We were also presented with flight vouchers, each worth ~$200 with no explanation. We assumed it was because the original flight was cancelled but it turned it was because they cancelled the Baltimore to Providence fight altogether. When we boarded the plane, there were only single seats available so my 8 and 10 year old kids each sat with strangers. I spoke to the gate agent at BWI and asked if there was any way we could get on the later flights to Providence or Boston that night. Eventually they were able to book me on the last flight to Providence and the rest of my family on the last flight to Boston. However, in addition to using the vouchers we received earlier in the day, we had to pay an additional ~$350. I called their executive customer service today to complain. They offered to refund the extra money paid and also offered $75 ea in vouchers but I still think we should have been entitled to much more.

This year, we decided to visit Ft. Lauderdale, Jamaica, Dominican Republic, and Miami for New Years. Well...so much for our plans as Southwest left our luggage behind in Ft. Lauderdale on Christmas Eve. When we arrived in Montego Bay, there seem to be about 15 or more other travelers in the same position as us. We filled out a report and were told the luggage should arrive mid next day. No such luck. In fact, we're 3 days into this without our luggage. Yesterday we were told one of our bags was found and would be delivered in 2-4 hours. Nope. Nothing. Nada. Today we called several times and it seems as if no one can get a hold of the carrier. The status has shown bags out for delivery for over 24 hours with no updates or luggage. To make matters worse, we leave for Punta Cana tomorrow and could miss delivery of our baggage if it somehow arrives. Even worse, I was told it may even be sent home (if it's actually found) which doesn't help us for the other locations.Also, I'm not sure if Southwest understands the gravity of the situation. Not only did we have to cancel our Christmas reservations and walk around in the same clothes for a couple of days, but this type of stuff causes relationship challenges....to say the least. Do you know how long it takes a woman to find a ""perfect"" new years dress? My partner is over it and she is ready to head home. I'm still in a much needed break from a stressful year. There is also another element of stress of wondering if we're going to see over $5k of items ever reappear. We spent thousands of dollars on this trip and it's about a total loss. My appetite for Southwest has been on the decline and after this experience...I think I'm done.","{'neg': 0.077, 'neu': 0.894, 'pos': 0.029, 'compound': -0.9154}",-0.9154

At this point my mother-in-law couldn't walk anymore because we were standing in line forever and she is elderly and has diabetes.

They absolutely refused to let us keep the aloe we were given by the medics because I refused to show them my daughter's burned chest! She is 7!

I mean the citizens of this country landed men on the moon 50 years ago and sent satellites to the furthest edges of our solar system yet they cant efficiently push people through airport arrivals. So after an hour and 15 minutes in a queue we were put into an area of robotic machines by semi robotic staff. One must put the four fingers of one hand on a glass plate on the machine, feed their passport into a slot and look at a light for the machine to take your photograph as if you are facing prison. The machine then spits out a paper ticket with your photo and passport details. In our case although the ticket told us to proceed out one of the semi robotic staff put us to another darn queue. This one took another 45 minutes and when we got to the counter we got to do it all over again. Thats to say, fingerprinted, photographed and passport examined. So what moron thinks its a good idea to push hundreds of people to machines only to then put them to human beings to do the exact same thing all over again?

The day my flight was to depart...there were icing conditions. American canceled flights for two days. Sadly, I missed my grandmothers funeral. A couple days later I saw charges on my credit card for the mileage copay. I thought...surely this is an oversight. I called American and was informed that weather conditions were considered an “act of God” and therefore nonrefundable. I just about lost it. Still reeling from my grandmother passing, I pleaded with the agent...hoping for compassion and understanding. What I received was typical jargon. After a lengthy “debate” the agent agreed to refund the charges if I could provide a death certificate and proof of relation. UNBELIEVABLE! I was not going to burden my mother with obtaining a death certificate. I offered to provide an obituary and funeral program. Begrudgingly, the agent agreed.

I had over 10 pairs of clothes and at least 6 pairs of shoes to wear over the all star weekend while I was in Chicago.

We flew with American Airlines. At the gate, the agent asked for volunteers to gate check our carry-ons because of limited overhead space. We volunteered- a big mistake!  When we arrived, our luggage did not arrive with us.  The wedding was six hours away!  We spoke to the agent, who said that our luggage is on route and will be delivered to us the following day. All of our wedding clothes, shoes, accessories including my custom-made shoes were in the suitcase.  We were so stressed that we won’t have anything to wear for the wedding!  The American Airline agent at Los Angeles then filed a claim with Central Baggage Resolution for us.  They agreed to reimburse us for the items that we need to purchase for the wedding with a limit of $3500/person. The agent also told us to mail in the receipts and paperwork right away to get the reimbursement. At this point we had three hours to go shopping for the wedding.  We went to the mall and quickly shopped for the four of us before the wedding. At the same time, I took pictures of all the receipts so I could email them for reimbursement as I was told. It was very stressful, but we tried our best to enjoy our cousin’s wedding that night. The next day, our suitcases were delivered, and I emailed all of my receipts and paperwork for the reimbursement. That day my husband decided to return the shoes that I bought for him because they hurt him.  We decided to return them because the shoes don’t fit right and because we thought that he won’t be reimbursed for them anyways because he had almost reached the limit for reimbursement from his outfit for the wedding.  Two weeks later an agent from the Central Baggage Resolution called me and said that our claims will not be honored because we returned the shoes, which again we thought will not be reimbursed anyways because of the limit.  I asked him to reimburse for the other items. He refused. I asked to speak to his supervisor. He said he had no supervisor.  Really?  I emailed him again to ask for the reimbursement of the other items. No answer.  Is this how American Airlines treat their customers?  Is this how they respond for their very own mistakes?

My husband who suffers from vestibular neuronitis (a problem with balance) took a seat at the table as he was feeling dizzy. My husband is a Royal Airforce Veteran. He then suffered a tirade from one of the servers who told him he couldnt sit there until the person at the table had finished his meal. Told him it was rude to sit there and asked who would do that. She continued with her abuse to myself and my daughter and added that we could not just have drinks, this after making us wait some time for her attention. We are from the U.K., were unaware that it is not allowed to take a vacant seat. This is an international airport where people from around the world with different rules and regulations visit. This woman is a very poor example of customer service, a disgusting ambassador for the airport and America. She left our family extremely upset with her atrocious behaviour.

-0.8967,2020-02-01,2020-02-01,10.0,AA doesn’t take responsibility for their mistakes,"I had a connecting flight from Milwaukee to Chicago and then on to DCA. My flight was supposed to arrive at the gate on time in Milwaukee, but the plane that was supposed to leave before ours had a mechanical problem and was delayed leaving about 1.5 hours before my flight. Instead of quickly moving my flight to the vacant gate next to ours when American realized the problem, they waited until over an hour AFTER my flight was supposed to leave to move the flight to the gate that was vacant the whole time. Once in the air, things went smoothly until we tried to land in Chicago and had a near-miss collision with another plane. The captain told us we were making our final decent and then suddenly the plane launched up. A few minutes later the captain came on with a not-so-assuring message that we almost collided with another plane but not to worry *long pause* it was safe. Not a great way to feel as we tried to make our second approach at landing. By the time we landed, I had just missed my connecting flight by 20 minutes and there were no more flights until the next day. The attendant at the gate made us wander through the airport to another terminal to find customer service where there was a 50 person line of people waiting to change their reservations due to my entire plane needing new connecting flights since no one was actually going from Milwaukee to Chicago (a relatively short drive). The customer service staff was extremely unapologetic. They didn’t care that we were now stranded for the night, almost died on the plane, or had to wait for over an hour on their line. When I finally got to the customer service agent, they told me here’s a new flight tomorrow and there’s nothing we can do about your 12 hours until the flight. Here’s a discount hotel website you can go to at your own expense. No “sorry” about this, no offer to pay for the hotel due to their mistake with changing the gates, not even a bottle of water. American couldn’t care less. For comparison, when I was delayed just 2 hours on a Delta flight, they at least were super apologetic and gave out free snacks, water, and playing cards at the gate for us, and that was not even a bad situation like this American debacle was. I tried reaching out to customer service twice after the trip and they refused to pay for the hotel, provide any sort of credit, or do anything about the situation. They blamed it on the weather (which really wouldn’t have been an issue if they had just moved my flight when the mechanical problems on the other plane started) and didn’t even offer any sort of apology compensation. The flight was delayed 115 minutes, and only 45 were due to weather (de-icing on the tarmac). The hotel I stayed in that night even cared more about the situation than American did and was apologetic. At the end of the day, if they had just treated me like a human being and taken responsibility by acknowledging the crappy situation they caused, it wouldn’t have been as big of a deal to have to get a hotel at my own expense. You’re just another number to American. And their pilots with their unsafe flying practices think that too.

All of my luggage contents were removed then shoved back into my bags without any findings. Approximately 75% of all passenger bags were inspected without any findings. The security line was so confusing with bags being removed and belongings being removed that people were walking away and leaving their personal belongings at security. In a span of 5 minutes, 3 different TSA agents brought over laptops to the gate agent that people left behind. I also walked away without my laptop then quickly returned to retrieve it.

We had a flight booked with them for the end of March and were notified by text 5 days in advance that the flight was cancelled. When we called their customer service line, we sat on hold for 40 minutes before being disconnected. We called back, checked the automated system for flight status, and it said the flight was still schedule to depart on time so we thought it might just be a glitch. When we had time to call back later that evening (we'd spent the day at a family funeral, BTW), we again sat on hold for about an hour before speaking to 3 different people, none of whom were remotely helpful or even sympathetic in getting us a new flight. Oh, and while we were on hold, we were searching online for other flight options, and our original flight was still showing as available to book through Kayak and Hotwire despite the Southwest agents confirming it had been cancelled due to the Boeing 8 groundings. The ""supervisor"" I was eventually escalated to was the snarkiest person I have ever had to deal with, openly mocking me, and refused to let me speak to someone else. We eventually got a refund, I complained to the company about the way the supervisor handled the call, and they offered a mid-value voucher toward our next flight. Honestly, I would not have booked with them again had it not been for the voucher, so I guess it was a smart move on their part, but now I'm regretting it. I just learned that they've changed my next flights for December due to ongoing issues with the Boeing 8 groundings. The new flight times involved much longer layovers and did not work with our itinerary so I had to call to get them to change the flight again. Once again, the agent was unpleasant and borderline rude. When I asked if the flights were at risk of being changed again between now and December she said yes. I understand that things come up and flights sometimes need to be cancelled or rescheduled, but to have 3 out of 4 flights we booked this year cancelled is excessive. When I spend hundreds of dollars to book a flight, I would prefer to feel secure that I will be able to get where I need to go when I need to, and Southwest has lost all of my remaining confidence.

The flight had a provided snack--a piece of ham on a buttered role and some chips.

Weirdly, flight attendants then almost immediately began a second beverage service, without even clearing trash from the first.  This despite there being nearly 2 hours of the flight left. And, instead of doing a full second beverage service, they lazily offered ""water, coffee, or juice"" because they were too lazy to open some cans.

When the aisle was clear, I approached a Flight Attendant and asked if we were going to get relief.  She said there was a problem with the air system and it would not cool down until door closed and engine started.  Pilot confirmed this a bit later to all passengers.  Passengers were visibly uncomfortable, fanning themselves and sweating.  My overhead airflow device was not working either.  I actually became very agitated and panicky.   My question for Delta is:  Why were we on a plane that needed maintenance and subjected to unbearable temperatures?  It was really difficult to breath.  If anyone else has experienced intolerable temperatures, please be sure to contact the airline and Department of Transportation.

I spoke to the gate agent repeatedly and she quoted me $1200 and $3000 to first class (which didnt surprise me because it was a $2500 upgrade when we booked the flights months earlier). Regardless, its a poor business practice to prefer your upgraded seats left empty by making the price for them astronomically high. I tweeted the same information to delta and have never heard anything. If I can help it, I'll never flight delta again. Outside of the upgrade situation, the flight attendants were kind, the economy seat and space was standard (uncomfortable when you're on flights for 24 hours), and on the long flight, the aircraft thought we were flight Africa to Newark so we never knew where we were in our flight path. Another reason I wont fly them again. Also, on our flight from Seoul to Phuket we flew ""Korean Air"".  If you can help it, don't fly Korean Air.  They were worse about they're upgrades (I was quoted $6000 to first class, but saw a korean family of 3 including a baby leave from first class - no way they paid $6000 each by what they were wearing).

Cancellations happen, I get that. But by the third time, I already had an uneasy feeling they would do it again.My Sept. 4 flight from Denver to Chicago Midway was canceled, they said, because of Hurricane Dorian, some 2,000 miles away. That’s possible, I guess. It was the only Southwest flight to Chicago cancelled that day, and it appeared that same scheduled flight did make it on from Chicago to cities on the East Coast. It’s worth noting that The Denver Post had just reported that only 17 flights to or from DIA and the Florida-South Carolina region were affected at that time by the hurricane, which had been downgraded to a Category 2.I might have let all that go had I not had a miserable experience from Midway to Denver in May, when my afternoon flight was delayed indefinitely, with no word on when it would actually leave. As my time at the airport approached 8 hours, I rebooked for a morning flight the next day and checked into a hotel. Morning came, and I was greeted by a text saying THAT flight was canceled and they’d send me to Cleveland on a 5:50 a.m. flight the NEXT day, and then to Denver. I went straight to the airport and miraculously got the last seat on a nonstop afternoon flight. At one point during that 24-hour ordeal, I heard someone who seemed to know about such things remark, “Southwest is getting greedy again.” A flight in January involved a legitimate last-minute cancellation because of weather, I think.I voiced my reliability concerns to Southwest, at the counter and with customer service over the phone, and suggested they’re losing customers because of it. I was told it is true Southwest “proactively cancels” more flights than other airlines, partly for safety reasons, partly because they fly lower than other airlines and into potentially disruptive weather, which I didn’t fully understand, and partly because their fleet of Boeing 737 MAX 8 Aircraft is temporarily grounded.“Bags Fly Free” and “No Change Fees” attract a lot of travelers to Southwest.

If you are flying solo then the boarding process seems ok and fair.  But, if you are traveling with children over 6 or as a couple, the order of boarding is a major consideration.  They board in assigned order - A 1 to 60 then B 1 to 60 then C.   So if you are say B 40 and 41 then you are the 100 and 101th person to board (not counting other special groups boarding ahead of you).   If you are down in the list of priority do not expect to sit together.   This is awful if traveling with children (or friends or family) over 6 years old.  Only option is to pay extra to board earlier.  For us this was $40 each.   So for me it would cost $80 to sit with my son (for every leg of our multi stop round trip) or have us randomly separated into middle seats and have him sit between strangers.  Not a great position to be in just before boarding and definitely an unfair penalty & unfair choice for families traveling.

Another 3 agents stood in a cluster a few counters down, helping no one.  But they couldn't come over and help the line because they were ""on the baggage desk.""

Very limited upgrade opportunities for a large number of elites on the route, even at this early hour.Third, it was a tired old USAirways A319, with small overhead bins and a worn cabin.  No in-flight entertainment.  The interior difference compared to a Delta A319 was night-and-day.Fourth, chaotic boarding.  A lack of coordination between flight attendants and the gate agent meant we stood for a long time on an unheated jet bridge...on a day where the temperature in Chicago was 8 degrees F.Fifth, quite average service.  As an elite flyer, American offers me a free snack in coach.  Instead of a flight attendant asking me ""would you like a snack today?,"" a snack box was shoved in my face from behind as the FA shouted, ""SNACK?""  One beverage was served and we landed shortly thereafter.Sixth, mediocre service extended into the airport.  Despite having a fancy international terminal (D) with a fancy international lounge (Flagship) at DFW, our international connecting flight left from terminal A--requiring taking a train to use the international lounge.  Quite annoying as we saw domestic flights (e.g., to Tulsa) leaving from the international gates.  The ""Flagship"" lounge was also average:  at 7:30a, they had no coffee brewed, and a staff member said it would be 10 minutes.

In fairness to Gatwick, outgoing security efficiency has improved in my experience over the past few years and one rarely has to wait more than five minutes to get through. Border Control on return is a different matter and baggage reclaim has a justifiable reputation for its tardiness. But then generally it takes ages to get through Border Control so maybe they figure what's the rush? After we leave the EU, goodness knows what a muddle the arrival process will be. You can be certain there will be teething problems. Probably caused by introducing new processes over an Easter weekend when the place is at its busiest. Most UK airports are the embodiment of Rip off Britain. No opportunity to pick your pocket is wasted from parking charges that would make a footpad blush, to funnelling you through horrible duty free malls and having nowhere quiet to sit, the experience is rarely serene. Gatwick is no exception, I can put up with that but not Gatwick's deteriorating punctuality and seemingly indifferent attitude to speeding up the arrivals process and getting out of the place as soon as possible.","{'neg': 0.12, 'neu': 0.792, 'pos': 0.089, 'compound': -0.8563}",-0.8563

How do you tell your 5 children they can’t go on a cruise  due to flight delays by Delta... needless to say we had to break the news to them. Our flight was delayed 4 times today. Initially it was due to weather issues in Ft. Lauderdale Fl after the issue was resolved we had no flight attendants to board the plan so the that we could board our cruise ship in Ft. Lauderdale on time. We have spent over $14,000 for a Christmas cruise for our children and Delta first of all is not taking any blame for the delay of flights. They only offered to reimburse us for our flight tickets. And did not offer us one thing for our cruise that we have been planning and saving for 6 months. I have been on the phone all afternoon trying get some sort of reimbursement or future travel accommodations we haven’t gotten any where with this issue. I have asked to be redirected to the corporate office and all I have gotten was some reservation specialist who can do one thing for us to compensate us for our missed cruise. Now I am left with 5 children who’s saying this is the worst Christmas ever and it truly breaks my heart to see my children cry because they have a great Christmas experience. I suggest when you fly Delta to make sure they have all their flight attendants in place if they ever have a flight delay or work on rebooking another flight as soon as possible with another airline. I have been a lifetime customer of Delta and I have never receive such horrible service when it comes to a company error or delay in a flight.

We arrived at terminal A, and had a connecting flight to Frankfurt, Germany. We had to navigate to terminal B, specifically gate B62. I looked up for the signage, directing me to the appropriate terminal. Terminal B was down a level, and by bus, the signs said we would be arriving. We took the elevator, as we had some carry-on luggage and the stairs looked, precarious. I could quite possibly be over-exaggerating, but we waited at this old elevator for what seemed like a solid 5 minutes, before the door opened. It was like a time warp, back to the 80's inside this elevator. We exited and saw a bus. As I approached the airport worker, I asked her if this bus went to terminal B. Very rudely, she asked me which gate. I told her gate B62. She said that this was not my bus, no bus goes to B62, and that I would have to go back up to terminal A, take a right, and another right and then I could get to terminal B. Confused because of the signs I just read, directing us to this bus, we turned around. Not wanting to wait for the slow elevator, we opted for the stairwell. The stairwell leading back to the terminal, was completely atrocious. Bird wire fencing for walls, trash, dirt and cigarette stench enveloped the narrow and steep stairs. I am not sure if they are even OSHA compliant. There was room for only one direction of travel up and down the stairs. A person walking down would have to stop, mash up against the bird wire fencing and wait for them to pass by. So we take a right and then another right, and we see a sign for terminal B and an arrow, but the ""B"" has been painted over, as if to signify that terminal B was not in the direction we were directed to go! We were basically leaving the airport, by following this rude airport workers' advice. I asked one of the security workers in that hallway if we could get to terminal B this way, and he rambled off on some rude tangent about can't I read the signs? Totally rude and un-helpful. Not wanting to miss our flight by leaving the terminal, we back tracked to the area we began from, in hopes to see another poorly illustrated sign. Luckily a flight attendant was sitting close by, and saw the look of confusion on our faces. She informed us that yes, we were supposed to leave the terminal, take the sky train to terminal B, gate B62. Off we went. When we got off the train, all I could see was a long line of passengers, waiting to get through security. Regrettably, we had to join that line. The line was formed with mis-matching, dated stanchions, crooked and not even wide enough to pull a carry-on through. In the back ground, all I could hear was security officers yelling and belittling passengers for having candy in their bags, over and over again. Publicly shaming these poor foreign passengers, in my country, which I love and have served and protected. I was so embarrassed. Is this how America treats people? First impression is the most important and this was a complete nightmare. Thank goodness my flight to Frankfurt was delayed, because I would not have made it home that day. We got through security and all the passengers at gate B62 were still standing in a long line, waiting to board. The entire airport was dark, dank, out dated and just rude.

As a UK citizen entering from the US and transiting to Manchester, we arrived in T3 and had to wait about 10 minutes for an operator to attach the airbridge. Once attached, we had a lengthy walk (about 15 minutes) to get to the UK Border and immigration check. Signage was OK but limited. Having been scanned at the ePassport barrier, I thought I was through and into the terminal proper but I was immediately confronted with another bank of scanners and bar code readers - no explanation or instructions. There was an unhelpful and surly security guard who stopped me from walking around these scanners. He told me that I had to (again) remove my glasses and have my photo taken for ""airport security"" - why? I asked him when my data would be removed from Heathrow's system. He gave me the impression he had no idea why I was asking and then glibly agreed with me that it would be deleted when I left the airport. I dont believe it for a moment. Given the recent court case about facial recognition software, where is the policy statement from Heathrow about the usage of our data and how it is protected/deleted? Once through this barrier, another lengthy walk to a bus gate for a long transfer to T5. Why does Heathrow not have a skytrain connecting terminals? After our overnight flight, we were made to wait about 30 minutes until a bus arrived at which point, there was a massive queue of people. The driver of the bus was rude, just packing people into the bus and then driving at quite a speed around a maze of roads to get to T5. We were then confronted with another walk to security where we again went through the usual street theatre of security, overseen by an unsmiling security guard - welcome to the UK. Had I been a foreign visitor, I would not have had a good impression of the UK. Once through the chaos of security, the shopping mall which is T5 was crowded with very few seats available and throngs of confused looking people.

I called my credit card company and they told me that Delta was not even trying to authorize the charge, so I tried again.  Same issue.  So I called customer service and sat on hold for an hour. The rep took 25 minutes to get my reservation working and quoted me the correct price that I was seeing online, then said she needed to put me on hold for 3 minutes.  10 minutes later she came back online and quoted a new price that was $50 more expensive per ticket than the previous one!!!  Of course, this is unacceptable so she transferred me to a supervisor, Al, in Atlanta, told me the same thing and that there was nothing he could do.  So even though I spent over 3 hours of my day trying to book tickets, which I couldn't book due to glitches with the Delta website and then my hour long wait on hold, I now had to pay $150 more for the 3 tickets I was trying to book!!!

I had 2 hours and 35 minutes before my next flight to Calgary, plenty of time, I thought. After disemabarking from my flight we were faced with total and utter chaos inside the airport, in fact it was more akin to a cattle market. In my 40 years of world travel and visiting both large and small airports, this was my worst experience at any time, anywhere. All the ""assistants"" were young girls who were far to busy on their intercom phones to talk with anyone, they just pointed where we all had to go. It was some 1 hour and 45 minutes later that I managed to get into the main hall (downstairs) to retrieve my luggage. I was then informed that I had to go through security before I could check in for my onward journey to Calgary. This I have never ever known before and there was now only 50 minutes before my next flight. Of course there was yet another long queue for the security. Many travellers (some quite older people) were trying to ask the young staff if they would miss there onward flight, their reply was always the same ""there is nothing we can do, just keep in the queue"". There was nowhere for these older people to sit and rest and most were just being pushed along, this was not a nice thing to see. Eventually, near the end of the queue I could see that the Immigration officers were sitting and there was not a single person in the queue? I just could not see why we were queuing at all until, I saw some machines. These machines were now quiet obviously the issue that was causing all the chaos. Thousands of people and only a few machines to service all passengers, and of course it was very plain to see that most passengers were having issues in working these machines and there was not one member of airport staff to assist anywhere to be seen. I finally reached the machines, in fact they are now the declaration machines. I am very competent with computers and I could see why people were now having issues. There was one question at a time on the screen and right at the very bottom it says continue, most did not see this were just looking around the screen and looking for some help. Alas, there was no forthcoming save from the odd passenger, myself included who showed them how these machines operated. There were no clear instructions anywhere. Disguting design in my opinion. Eventully I filled in the declaration and form the machine I recieved a ticket. I then rushed to the nearest Immigration officer as I had 10 minutes left to check in and get to the boarding gate. The officer just looked at my passport and said have a good holiday and let me through very quickly. I then look at three different boards for my Flight number and boarding gate. It is only now that I am beggining to feel totally frustrated at the lack of staff around to assist. I went from one end of the check in right down to the other end and there was no check in for Air Transat to be found.

Me and my wife have finally arranged a vacation after 5 years of not being able to go anywhere. Our plan was to travel in Germany, Austria and Czech Republic within around 9 days. It was not a long vacation but it was nicely scheduled and organized by my wife. My wife was going to travel to Germany from Istanbul, Turkey and I was flying from New York, USA. My wife doesn't speak English well so we scheduled it as I would arrive Germany 2,5-3 hours before her flight arrives and I meet her right at the airport, go to the hotel, relax and get ready for our nice trip. My Delta flight to Tegel/Berlin, Germany on 7/7/2019  was supposed to take of at 8:40 pm. We got into the plane with 2 hours delay. No one was giving us proper information at all and all the answers we were receiving was ""we do not know"". Later on, we were told that the delay was caused by a maintenance issue. We boarded the plane and while thinking we will finally fly we waited in the plane for 3 hours. The pilot first told us that there are planes in front of us and we were waiting for that reason. After around 3 hours we were told that the same maintenance issue has happened again and we had to go back to the gate. While waiting there, someone from the crew announced that passengers may choose to step out of the plane while the repair is being done (I have never heard an optional leaving of the plane). 5 minutes later were were told that everybody has to leave the plane and we were all sent back to the gate. Supposedly, the original delay was because of a maintenance issue which was fixed but obviously they didn't do a good job. What if the same issue has come back during the flight? At the gate, we were first told that the repair will only take 30 minutes. When the passengers started asking what is going on after 30 minutes we started getting the ""we don't know"" answers all over again. Nobody knew what was going on and nobody cared about people's plans.I flew with several other companies including Southwest, JetBlue, Turkish Airlines, Lufthansa but whether it was a major or minor issue, delay, etc. people were informed properly and taken care of. Delta did nothing! I flew with Delta 22 years ago and it was a horrible experience. I thought things would have changed. I was right about the change part but couldn’t guess that it changed into an even worse status.  I couldn't arrive Berlin early to meet my wife so she had to go through a lot of trouble. We made a reservation for a hotel which I couldn't use. We had to reorganize everything on our itinerary since I lost 1 day. When I wrote my complaint to Delta they deposited lousy 17500 miles to my SkyMiles account saying that they already gave me a taxi voucher so that I could go home the night I could not fly. According to Delta this is a favor they have done for me. Oh btw, I am unable to use the 17500 miles they have deposited since I do not have the high level membership.

Problems began during the boarding process.  Passengers in the main cabin immediately noticed a stench that nearly reached the first class cabin.  Turns out: even though the plane had spent the previous day in the maintenance hanger, neither aft lavatory was operational--or had even been cleaned.  Maintenance was summoned, and after a 50 minute delay we were able to depart--but I am amazed that this plane was returned to service with such an obvious unresolved problem.  How could the crew not notice the smell?So it was not a good start for anyone on the flight, but what struck me was how little American Airlines did to differentiate the experience for the first class passengers.  The seats were surely wider and had more legroom than in coach, but the recline was probably no more than 10 degrees.  In flight entertainment was entirely do-it-yourself; there was no video screens or even tablets for first class passengers.  Separation of the first class cabin from the main cabin was negligible.  There was a curtain that could be pulled across the aisle but it remained open throughout the flight, which invited main cabin passengers to use the forward lavatory--which they did throughout the flight, without a single challenge from the crew.  Not that the forward lavatory was anything special: it was the same tiny lavatory one might expect in the main cabin.  Not even bin space was protected.  Arriving main cabin passengers filled up the first class bin space (again without any intervention from the crew) so that a late arriving first class passenger had to struggle to rearrange bags to find space for his own carry on (again without any assistance from the crew which passively watched him struggle.)However, the dinner (short ribs) was excellent.American Airlines can do well with business class travel.  Our outbound itinerary included a very good experience on a 767 and an excellent experience on a 777.  However, this experience on a 737 was poor rather than first class.  If I again encountered an itinerary that included a transcontinental segment on an American Airlines 737, I'd instead book a different routing or different airline.","{'neg': 0.096, 'neu': 0.831, 'pos': 0.073, 'compound': -0.8226}",-0.8226

I was informed by Virgin Atlantic that my connecting is on Terminal 4 and  I won’t need to change terminals. I had to take my bags from the carousel and had to hand them over to Delta’s baggage services. I asked the lady at the delta reception if she can change my boarding pass since it didn’t say TSA pre check on it. She declined saying it was Virgin who issued it. She also told me that my flight is leaving soon in terminal 2 so I better hurry up. I rode the tram to terminal 2, only to find out that my aircraft is leaving from terminal 4 where I originally was. The gentlemen from delta politely changed my boarding card with a TSA pre check so that it will be quicker for me to queue. He is the only reason I am giving this a one star. Obviously, I missed the flight. My flight leaves at 16:55 and I arrived at the door at 16:48, and I know this time the door of the aircraft is already closed. I was directed to gate 31 to have my ticket rebooked. I was glad that they did for the 18:00 flight, but when I reached gate 36, I found out that my seat is on the main coach, and it’s a window seat. My first class ticket just became an economy seat with no perks at all. I asked the gentleman at 36b and he informed me that they don’t have a seat available. It’s a courtesy that they booked me because I missed my connecting flight despite informing him that I was given the wrong information, otherwise, I wouldn’t have missed it. I begged, as in begged for an aisle seat anywhere in the cabin and I have a medical condition that requires me to stand up every now and then, but he said that there was none and to swap a seat with the person seating next to me. I asked for the next flight and I won’t mind waiting. He said there’s none as well. He said I can pay if I want to go back to first class for $1700 since I am not an “executive member of Delta”. I explained to him that I am a silver member of Virgin, and it may not be much for a membership compared to other frequent flyers, but I also paid for the full price of my entire journey, all as first class seats. I contacted Delta and they informed me that they only communicate via twitter messages or Facebook and don’t reply via email. So I thought to share my experience online. Delta has poor service recovery and didn’t take accountability that I was provided the wrong terminal, declined a TSA pre checked boarding pass which escalated everything. Instead, the answer I got was “contact Virgin Atlantic for monetary refund.” I wasn’t asking for one. All I was asking is for me to understand why I was downgraded to economy from a first class seat. I’m not that tall, I am just 5’11” but being cramped in a window seat didn’t help at all, which irritated the woman sitting next to me because I stood up 4x in the 5 hour or so flight.

It's pretty clear that seat selection is based on each individual's boarding number, not the boarding number of their travelling companion.

After a long flight from the UK we were told by the apologetic captain that we were being held on the tarmac due to there being no free gates available to disembark. He mentioned how it was ridiculous that an airport of their size wasn't prepared for our arrival. When we finally disembarked an hour later, we entered the worst immigration queues I have ever had the misfortune of standing in. Two and a half hours it took, in a room with no air conditioning. We had a toddler that didn't understand what was going on and almost collapsed in the heat. No one was offering water or seats, just warnings that phones must be kept in pockets. To add insult to injury we had to endure the constant repeating of the flash entry video about how easy they make immigration. It was inhumane how they treated people, coming into their country to spend a lot of money. Eventually we got to baggage claim where our bags had been removed from the belts and deposited anywhere there was room. Then we were greeted with huge queues at the car rental desks. It may sound sensationalist, but it has honestly put me off travelling to Orlando again. The way out wasn't much better. An hour and a half to get through security on the way out. Staff looked like they didn't care and were rude and arrogant. I'm not sure I understand the idea of all the best shops and restaurants being before the security checks either. You can't spend any time browsing as you don't know how long it's going to take to get through. Once you get through security your choice is severely limited. Can I make one suggestion?

Originally, in August of 2019, I purchased two flights to Mexico. One of them needed to be canceled and Southwest would not allow me to do that without eating the cost of the entire $500 flight. In return they offered me a transfer of funds for a hundred dollar fee - having no choiceI accepted this change. I then went to use the rest of my voucher (prior to the date of expiration) and found that I could not find the voucher id number. The company reached out and said this would be, NO ISSUE AT ALL - and within three days they would e-mail me the new number with an extension of six months time due to covid restrictions - GREAT! Right? - No. They then sent nothing, went radio silent. So I proceeded to reach BACK OUT to the company (on my time!) and when they reached out again they told me they would not only not honor what had been said but they would now only honor it if they could take another ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS from the $189 voucher. At this point, that would be $200 lost to their customer service department. I really just can’t fathom the inability for such a LARGE company to foot a hundred dollar bill (that I’ve already PAID) and also tell me that there is no one who can be spoken to about this except the one person in the department who is the “supervisor” - I have worked in sales/customer service for many years and this is absolutely ridiculous behavior for a company that prides themselves in the value of the customer experience.

I was flying American Airlines from Charlotte to Pittsburgh to see friends and normally I use Park N' Go but this time I decided I'd park in the Daily Decks since it was closer to the terminal I was only going for 3 days, I always avoid the Long Term lots since those lots are a zoo and they have been that way forever. When I parked the first shuttle was full so I waited almost 20 minutes for another one to come and when it came the driver offered no help to anyone with large suitcases. In the airport the line at check in was ridiculous, the agents were taking their sweet time checking people in, American app was not working so I couldn't check in with it. Check-in took about 25 minutes, security lines were insanely long and I finally ended up going to the E checkpoint even though my flight was at Concourse C since it was the least of all of evils but even then TSA still took almost an hour. TSA Staff were all very rude and were barking orders at people military style, I put my laptop in the plastic bin with my wallet, phone, and shoes like I have countless times before without a problem and the TSA agent barked at me claiming I wasn't following directions and that my laptop had to go in it's own container, I looked on TSA.gov and nowhere does it say that's required, all it says is you have to remove the laptop from your carry on, which I did. Of course since I knew they were just doing their job I didn't argue. I go through the scanner and wait for my bags and I couldn't find my backpack, I ask one of the agents and she flat out ignored me and said I was asking the wrong person. I finally saw them staring at my bag on the screen and I stood there until finally after 15 minutes an agent asked ""is this your bag"" and I said yes. As it turned out a set of souvenir coins that had formed a clump in my backpack apparently looked weird but when I asked if I could just take it out and show them what it was they yelled at me saying I wasn't allowed to touch the bag and I'd be denied boarding if I did. Nobody was willing to help, they were treating all the passengers like dogs, even children and the elderly, it was just appalling. There's a large amount of restaurants and retail outlets at CLT but once you're at the gate the seating areas are cramped and there is very limited seating. The concourses have hardly changed at all since the late 90s. Some of the gates in Concourse E still use ancient dot matrix printers. After the TSA incident I just barely made my flight by 15 minutes even though I arrived at the airport almost 2 hours prior, gate agent was the only nice person I encountered at the airport, she probably heard of the all the TSA problems from other passengers because when she scanned my ticket she said ""don't worry I wouldn't have closed the door on you"" she said there were 12 people on the flight still stuck in the TSA lines.

There were a few flakes. The real issue was that Delta did not have a back up plan due to holiday congestion at JFK and long taxi tarmac times which forced us to deplane due to the free overextending their hours. When we finally got on a new plane (SIXTEEN HOURS) since arriving at JFK our flight was needlessly delayed one hour before we boarded, than another 45 minutes because their driving truck had a malfunction.

I wanted to ensure she could sit with either her mother or I. He wasn’t supportive and frankly was just plain rude. Told me that was my problem and if I didn’t want her to get on the plane alone I could board with the C passengers. I had no problem doing that but as expected her C number was so high when we got on we had to sit separately. I recognize this might sound trivial but she was an emotional wreck by the time we landed in Baltimore.

In both instances my bag was within the size limit and there was significant bin space available to accept carry on bags. For anyone whose zone for boarding is later in the process, forced bag check was routine on both of these flights. When I questioned whether I could carry on, because I had tight time frames upon landing, I was told that my bag was oversized. Even with American's very tight bag width limit of 9"" my bag qualified, although I was not given the option to to utilize the measuring device on the most recent flight. In both instances many the bags that had been allowed to board and were stored in the overhead bins were larger than mine. Upon contacting American regarding this inconvenience and also sharing that my brand new, high quality suitcase was broken, obviously due to rough handling, I was given a standard scripted response. I did not feel that the response I received was a sincere concern based apology, nor did it acknowledge Americans reason for this practice. Based on my recent experience, it is obvious to me that for whatever reason American has forced bag check for certain boarding zones, despite significant bin space availability. This causes inconvenience for those of us who wish to carry on our bags. The strict 9"" width limit for bags is not customary when compared to other airlines and certainly does not correspond to the actual size of the overhead bin space that is actually available to store bags. Furthermore, the staff is not friendly and does not convey customer appreciation. As a frequent traveler I will avoid American at all costs. With competitors like JetBlue and Southwest, who make me feel appreciated as a customer and who have never forced me to check my small carry on, there should be little need for me to fly American in the future.","{'neg': 0.084, 'neu': 0.842, 'pos': 0.073, 'compound': -0.7077}",-0.7077

However, whilst our flight was no worse than expected, I want to warn other travelers of the fate that awaits you in Miami Airport after your 10 hour journey Having paid and obtained our ESTA visas before leaving home, we still had first to queue for half an hour before reaching one of the machines that issues you with a form to present to an Immigration Officer. Next we had to join another queue for 2. and a half hours before we were cleared to proceed through Customs. My husband suffers with acute pain in his back and legs if he has to stand too long. Others in the queue had connecting flights: no provision was made to expedite their cases. There were fretful, little children in the queue- nobody cared at all. Despite what they could see before their eyes, the Immigration Officers seemed to make no attempt at all to work a little faster or more efficiently. We observed one who appeared to ‘flirt’ and chat with 3 pretty girls at his station.  Only one third of the Immigration officials booths were manned. When we complained we were told nothing would be done. My husband and I leave the UK behind each Feb/March as we are in the fortunate position of being able to go wherever we feel like for some warm and sunnier weather.

When it finally was near time for the departure for the later flight, suddenly there was a flurry of activity at the adjacent gates, when apparently four American flights were to depart within 15 minutes of one another from gates D-1 to D-5. And since there seemed to be only one PA, the assembled passengers became understandably restless when the gate attendant announced ""we are now boarding Groups 1 and 2"" without bothering to state the destination or flight number. Confusing? You bet. Especially when said announcement was drowned out by another PA telling ""passenger XXX, please report to the gate."" Final boarding began when five wheelchairs were rolled to the plane, followed very quickly by anyone who simply showed his/her boarding pass and walked aboard. There was only one American gate agent on duty, apparently all the others were still dealing with the adjacent flights.

Not traveling on business this time, I was an economy passenger and I experienced this in such status. Basically, Terminal 3 is just a vast, overpriced shopping mall, crammed with every high-end store imaginable, with limited seating and limited amenities that I could see, e.g., USB charging ports for cell phones. One has to sit in a crowded, central seating area where gates are not announced until around 40 minutes before the boarding time. Once a gate is announced, it can be a 15-20 minute trek to a gate, even with moving sidewalks. And beware, there are very few toilets! The signs for the toilets take you on a yellow brick road kind of odyssey which can encompass a 10 minute walk through a maze of stores, unless I missed something, there is only one near the entrance to the mall after exiting security. There are no toilets near or at the gates, which, as I said, can be very far from the main seating ""pen"" so to speak. Also, the security lines can be long. When the airport web site states ""arrive 3 hours before departure"" there is a very good reason for that.

Cancelling was not an option. The storm did not come and I left Flagstaff with clear skies. These clear skies were all the way down to Phoenix which happened to be the path the flight would have taken. Initially the customer service representative was helpful and told me that my I would get reimbursed for gas and parking for my unexpected driving trip. You can not ask for anything in the form of compensation until your whole trip is over. They refused any compensation and stated the storm was too bad. Lies!!! The kicker is that Flagstaff is very small and I know people who work for the airline here and they stated that the airlines did not want to send that flight because it was not full. I booked this trip 5 months in advance. It ended up costing me double the cost of if I would have driven the 2.5 hours to phoenix and caught the flight. I have flown with them hundreds of times over the years and lately cancellations are happening more often.

Useless time waster as staff were unable to handle the capacity of arrivals. Absolutely agitating and embarrassing. Shame on YYZ.

-0.6818,2020-03-01,2020-03-01,20.0,A Friday the 13th Horror on Delta Airlines Flight DL 3097,"I, along with two other passengers (three black women) in my row, traveling from a symposium, had a horrific experience of unequal treatment by a flight attendant on Delta Airlines flight (DL 3097) from Atlanta, Georgia, to Daytona Beach, Florida, on Friday, March 13, 2020.  Onboard the flight DL 3097, the flight attendant (white woman) treated us differently than the other passengers on the plane, as compared to the excellent customer service to the row of passengers (two white females and a child) behind us. While passing out the snacks and beverages on Delta Airlines flight DL 3097, the flight attendant, either deliberately or inadvertently, neglected to serve me water without ice. As she approached the next row, a very observant student of mine politely said to the attendant, ""Excuse me, you forgot to give her the water."" The flight attendant responded rudely and continued to serve the passengers in the row behind us. After serving the next row and thanking the passengers for having ""good"" manners, she handed me the water without ice but not without an attempt to chastise me about whether or not I asked for water.The DL 3097 flight attendant finished her rounds, and as she headed back up the aisle, I stopped her and asked for her name. She gave me her first name. I asked for her last name as well. She leaned in toward our row, and her attempt to apologize went in the wrong direction. In an elevated tone, she raised her voice and said, ""You can write a report because I plan to write one of my own."" This statement was noticeable among others on the flight, odd and unwarranted. I only asked for her first and last name, nothing more. As the attendant displayed an abrasive attitude, I decided to have a teachable moment with the passengers in my row about the unfair treatment, which mirrored the persistence of prejudice in today's society. I asked each traveler in my row for their perspective on the action to take regarding the unacceptable treatment we received from the Delta Airlines DL 3097 flight attendant. Specifically, I wondered would they write the incident up or turn the other cheek (a biblical phrase). One traveler, who was on her first roundtrip flight and first time out of the state of Florida, didn't have an immediate response but later said she would write it up because she writes everything. The other traveler said she would turn the other cheek and be merciful. Amid this teachable moment, which I felt was appropriate and necessary, a passenger in the row in front of us was trying to get my attention. When the passenger (white woman) finally got my attention, I asked her if she would like to say something. She immediately responded, ""Have you ever heard of beating a dead horse? We all hear you, you know."" I, for one, would never beat a dead horse. It's inhumane! But, since I'm from the south, I have heard of this saying and fully understand it's meaning. She uttered other comments, but I stopped listening to her. This opportunity was yet another teachable moment. It showed in real-time the outcome of allowing one person to treat you with less than dignity and respect. Others will feel they can do the same. The behavior is like a contagion and spreads quickly. After we wrapped up the discussion on the matter, we sat quietly and eagerly waited for the flight to land.After the horrible flight incident, death stares from a party of white passengers, and a wait time of 1 hour 01 minutes and 15 seconds to speak with a Delta Airlines representative, I remembered a fundamental life lesson. Though the Delta Airlines flight DL 3097 incident was traumatic, I feel that forgiveness is essential and will bring peace. I strongly encourage Delta Airlines to richly invest in professional training to help employees, like the DL 3097 flight attendant, better reflect the company's core values of Respect and Servant Leadership.","{'neg': 0.098, 'neu': 0.802, 'pos': 0.099, 'compound': -0.6818}",-0.6818

The attendent who had already passed me by several rows, turned around to bring a drink to a passenges and noticed me in the seat.  She immediately came back and told me I was not allowed to sit there and when I suggested the row was empty and gave me room to stretch my legs she very rudely stated go back to your seat.  I complied.  About 5 minutes later, a robed, christian brother got up from his seat and sat in the row I had.  After about 20 min. the same attendent came back and spoke for a minute or two with him.  Then left and he stayed in the emergency row.  When she came past me several minutes later, I shrugged my hands and pointed to the monk.  She just gave me a dirty look and moved on.  First, if seats are empty in the same class and a customer would be more comfortable in one of them, I would think that the airline would be happy to accomodate as an effort to please a customer.  I assumed that the attendent did not have the ability to allow that to occur and so I did not complain.  However, when an attendent discriminates against one passenger and accomodates another that is simply not acceptable.  Finally, the rudeness exhibited by this attendent is never acceptable.","{'neg': 0.097, 'neu': 0.841, 'pos': 0.062, 'compound': -0.6718}",-0.6718

I called American and the representative said they had recently changed meal options and no choices for vegetarians were available on her screen, but I should check at the gate.  The gate agent told me no meals would be served on our flight because the flight wasn’t long enough.  So, we boarded and shortly after we reached altitude a flight attendant asked me what meal I preferred—turkey or chicken.  Surprised, I said I was told at the gate that there wasn’t meal service on the flight, but I’d appreciate a vegetarian option.  “There isn’t one,” she said.  “There’s a turkey wrap or a grilled chicken salad.”  I asked her what exactly vegetarians were offered for paying a Business Class fare.  She said the chicken was served separately so I could just eat the salad by itself.  When the meal came, it was a large portion of chicken on a plate and a tiny dish of slightly wilted chopped salad.  I emailed American’s customer service center, and they responded by depositing 1500 miles into my AA frequent flyer account. Not enough of an apology for their incompetence and lack of customer service, or much incentive to fly American in the future.

The first flight had a stop in Atlanta which failed horribly. Once we landed we awaited a airplane in front of us to move to allow us to use their terminal. It could not move due to maintenance issues (or so they say).  Myself and my family were waiting for at least 20 minutes until the other airplane finally was able to move to allow us in. In this time we missed the connecting flight to our destination (which was supposed to be landing in Allentown that night). We instead had to wait in line after a much hurried run with two adults and two children under the age of 6 to the next terminal when we asked the attendant if the plane left. It did and he instructed us to to go where they handle these instances at customer service. There was a large line and we were instructed to go onto the phones which only handled booking the next flight for the morning and not the hotel. My husband had to wait in a second line while I watched over the kids for at least 2 hours to get a hotel booked (this is 12AM mind you) for that night at a hotel nearby. We were at least given a flight the next morning around 7am and a hotel stay which had a very long line to even check in and this took nearly 2 hours in itself (this is bringing us to about 2am). We had nearly 3 hours of sleep for Christmas Eve! On the way back from Allentown our plane was immediately late by 2 hours. Our stop over in Michigan had a 40 minute layover time in between flights (the same as the first to which we missed). We had to book another flight then to Michigan to connect to our destination in Denver and ended up waiting in the Michigan airport for 4 hours!. Again, this is with two children under 6 and comfort plus seats that I spent extra hundreds of dollars on to not get them in the end anyway. If the trip had gone correctly it would have been leaving by 130 and arriving in Denver at 530. Instead we had to leave by 330 and get to Denver by 12AM! Keep in mind we arrived at the airport for our first flight by 12pm to make sure for enough time. This is a 12 hour time span in the airport that day! The first plane on the way back was small and not taken care of well as the seats were ripped and the airplane attendants were also rude. The second plane was a large plane that was extremely hot and we were not given the seats that I paid for. The air conditioner had to not be working because I would get cold air in about 10 minute increments. We were promised a food ticket to which was not given and the attendant insisted to my husband (in a very rude way) when he asked for a par of earbuds ""its on my sir, its only two dollars but ill give them away this time"" and huffed off like she was doing us a good deed. What about the hundreds of dollars lost when we had to arrive in Philly airport the first time instead of ABE? We had to drive an hour to Allentown on the first trip just because they did not have another flight to ABE! What about the Comfort Plus seats I had paid for that were not taken care of?

One of the major paradoxes in the world is that Los Angeles gets more visitors than practically anywhere else in the world. Fourth to be Exact for this year. And yet it is an International embarrassment to walk to one and through one. This is even far more true for domestic travels. Yes, I'm pretty sure Joe Biden flew into LAX and that is when he famously is quoted for ""Some of these Airports we have here in the US are 3rd world in class."" There is nothing in these Airports you will ever take your camera and pose with. And that - is tragically - pathetic. How do you spell LAX? P-A-T-H-E-T-I-C. You have Hollywood right here. Legions of iconic celebrities. Monroe. Hepburn. James Dean. Legions of classy world class photographs and you see not one anywhere in this sorry excuse of an airport. How bad Los Angeles Airport is, it a testimony to how pathetic the city's leaders are. No vision. No Class. Just like their airport. A 3rd World Airport. I was here, unfortunately, just this month in April for a flight out with United. Dear God, will someone take a photo of this horror - this sorry excuse for an Airport - and put it next to photos from the Airport in Munich, Hong Kong, Dubai, Singapore or anywhere else in the world. Suffice it to say, Los Angeles Airport - for a world class destination - is firmly cemented in a 3rd world class reputation. If you can avoid the LAX Los Angeles Airport - do so - it is like a Plague. Its not like me to criticize without offering resolutions. Disney. Universal Studios. Have them sponsor a renaissance into the world of tomorrow. Have them foot the bill sponsoring something more World Class than 3rd class, 3rd world class, only worthy of condemnation, by the likes of Vice President Joe Biden.","{'neg': 0.103, 'neu': 0.794, 'pos': 0.103, 'compound': -0.5145}",-0.5145

There was a group of 20 of us.  My sister and her boyfriend live in Vegas, so she was flying to MSP via spirit Airline to meet up with us and then she was going to fly delta with our group.   Due to an attendant not calling their gate through spirit, they missed their flight while sitting in the airport along with several other people.  LiThey went to the Delta desk in Vegas to see if they could arrange that.  Li told that they would need to call the MSP delta desk to arrange that as they were not ab Ok le too.  They were given the Delta MSP number and gave it a call.  At first they were told that they couldn’t help them because they were a private reservation through delta vacations (a travel agent booked us).  They called again and then were told that they could not put them on a later flight, that they would both need to buy new tickets ($800 a piece, so $1600 total).  They were told their original delta vacations package that they paid $5000 dollars for, would be cancelled.  Since that was an outrageous amount to pay, they asked if they could book a cheaper airline to Riviera Maya, and then fly their original booking through delta vacations ( THAT THEY ALREADY PAID FOR) back home with the rest of the group.  They were told by the delta rep that as soon as they miss the first flight, EVERYTHING IS CANCELLED.  UMMM NO! They paid for those seats!! After all night and day one and half of day 2 of vacation ruined, a delta rep called my sister after she sent in a review and swung her a deal for a $500 flight there and allowed her to ride back on her original booking.  Her boyfriend on the other hand was being sent back and forth and after 3 days of fighting with delta, a rep called and gave him a free flight out.  Spirit refunded their missed flight because it was on them.  They should have been arranged on a later delta flight out as it was not their fault- except delta didn’t care because it was a spirit flight they missed.  They finally got the flights figured out, but then they had to re- add her boyfriend to the resort room.  They called the resort and they stated that they could do that for free since it was already paid, but they needed the ok from delta vacations.  Delta vacations said no, they have to pay an extra $300 to be added to the room (THAT THEY ALREADY PAID FOR) so our travel agencies manager paid out of her OWN POCKET because delta vacations wouldn’t budge and they felt horrible for the situation.  Ridiculous!Now onto all of MY ISSUES.  My husband and I have a 1 year old son riding as a lap infant.  Our travel agent said he flies free on our lap, we just have to pay taxes on his seat. Great, so we did.  We get to the airport the morning of our flight on January 14th in Fargo ND, and the delta rep tried telling us we needed to buy him a seat for $1000!!!!.  After arguing for 10 minutes she agreed and said we just needed to pay the taxes on his ticket.  I already paid them, but we were late now to get through security so I paid them AGAIN and I emailed my travel agent to take care of getting my money refunded.  We again were told we needed to pay the taxes when we got to the MSP airport!!!! What the hell delta.  We told them no and told them what we had already gone through and they let us into our next flight.We arrive at our resort in Riviera maya Mexico and meet with the delta vacations rep to make sure our transport back to the airport at the end of our vacation was all set.  We get there and the rep had us on several different flights and transfers ( most importantly, had us separated from our son, who we booked with his grandparents so we could get upgraded for our wedding at the resort).  After emailing my travel agent and talking the the resort rep, they figured it out and all was good.Now leaving the airport, everyone had their transfers from the resort confirmed with delta vacations , however when our transport van showed up, wouldn’t you know, one of our members names wasn’t ON THE LIST!  So after arguing with the transport driver for 15 minutes, the resort bellman spoke with him and we were all finally let on the transfer bus.When we arrived at the Fargo airport on the 21st, our stroller for our son which we had been checking at the gate each time, the wheel AND the brakes are broken.  The wheel is jacked and doesn’t work anymore, brakes don’t work at all.  If it was a $25 stroller I wouldnt care, but this is a several hundred dollar Chicco jogging stroller and I’m very upset.I spent 3-4 of my vacation/ wedding  days figuring out deltas mess, dealing with crap I shouldn’t have had too.  I also have a broken stroller on top of it.  I ALWAYS fly delta airlines and I have never been so unimpressed and UPSET about our service as I have been this time.  I understand having policies in place, but when it’s from a circumstance completely out of a passengers hands, delta should accommodate.  Especially considering the amount of money my entire group of 20 paid to use their service and we are ALL VERY UNIMPRESSED.  We will definitely never be booking a delta vacation package ever again and will be looking into American Airlines for our next vacation.I want to thank a few people that tried helping to the best of their ability during this whole mess— Lisa and Cindy at travel travel in Fargo ND, and Carlos from delta vacations transport service at the Barcelo maya grand resort.  Without the three of them,  it would have been a lot more awful of a situation.","{'neg': 0.076, 'neu': 0.846, 'pos': 0.078, 'compound': -0.4631}",-0.4631

Although the staff was pleasant they were inefficient (eg, multiple staff standing around just watching a partner do something) and slow (eg, I had to stand in the scanner for 3 min, just waiting, until they finally scanned me; the bag review process was longer than other airports; employees walked and talked slowly rather than efficiently and also they were condescending asked spoke as if the passengers were 2 year olds). They have not upgraded to the latest screening procedures or machines so that took longer as well, with people being forced to do things other airports no longer require.

The earliest time we can check in for our flights was at 2:30pm. My wife set an alarm on her phone at 2:30pm  for us to check in on the South West App So we can sit together for our 8 hour flight back to Orlando. The App is flawed, it only allowed one of us to check in and gave an error for my wife saying “airport check in required” when all of her current information including the passport was updated. If you have not flown with South West before, they do not give you assigned seats. If you do not check in at the exact time of your familyMember,  you risk the chance of not sitting with them for the flight. This may not be a big deal for some, however for us, we are both very nervous flying and find comfort in sitting next to each other. Now we have to wait until tomorrow to find out if someone will help us and we will sit together or not which gives me a high level of anxiety. - If this was the only issue I’d experienced with South West I would not have taken the time to write a review, however it’s not. My wife and I also traveled back from Rochester, NY toOrlando, Florida in June 2019 with family and had another awful experience with this airline. When we arrived 3 hours early for our flight leaving Rochester, the attendant informed us that our flight “may be delayed” and recommended that we switch to a different connecting flight. We took her advice to learn that the Rochester flight was never delayed. We arrived in Orlando at midnight on a Thursday to find that South West lost our luggage from the change in connecting flight. The manager in Orlando was not empathetic in the slightest and treated us like this happens all the time for this airline, even after my wife explained that she had her suit in her luggage for a big interview the following day. Their customer service is mediocre, they lack compassion maybe due the nature of the job they do everyday. On our connecting 2 flights to Puerto Vallarta I expressed concern of our luggage making with us (due to the experience I had from Rochester) to one of their staff members at the gate. The woman was abrupt and dismissive with me and responded “we kind of do this a lot”; which did not help to ensure me based on our previous experiences.  Due to the multiple experiences I’ve hadWith South West, I would not recommend them toFriends or family. The small amount of money you may save with flying Southwest is not worth the stress or lack of exceptional customer service.","{'neg': 0.06, 'neu': 0.89, 'pos': 0.05, 'compound': -0.4612}",-0.4612

We were arriving from a very long flight with two small children and everything about that fact is just plain awful. There is a short walk to immigration, probably the only plus, and then the confusion begins. They won't have your stroller yet so you carry all of your luggage and small children. There is no family friendly or child friendly service. You wait in very long lines with very poor line management, changing the configuration willy nilly at will and people in the back of the line might be first ones through kind of deal. Then because their long lines are so terrible with poor customer service and direction usually your bags are out on baggage claim. Used to have to wait for that for hours but they've fixed that problem by delaying you elsewhere. Then our bag is lost and nobody knows where it is or really helps in any way. There is no convenient counter to offer assistance. Every person working there is like a free agent, not connected to the larger web. Then you wait in another line to get through baggage and when you voluntarily have one item checked out by animal control they rudely handle your stuff.  Then when you finally find someone at a baggage counter and say 'hello' they don't bother looking up from their phone to say hi back and then are just so not helpful that you decide to run screaming out of this whole place and try your luck on the phone later because humans are incompetent.

Delta had a skeleton crew taking care of the elitists only and Delta didn't have anyone to wait on regular flyers.  People had to complain for an employee to begrudgingly pick up the phone to call for additional help. Luckily I had time  to spare to board.  Got onboard and sat there.  And sat there.  Finally an announcement was made that the flight was delayed due to ""maintenance problems.""  Being nervous about flying anyway, that wasn't a warm and fuzzy.  Then as 45 minutes passed, I thought about my connecting flight in Detroit.  Finally the flight took off.  No problems, smooth sailing.  Upon landing in Detroit, no measures were taken to let passengers off first that had to bust butt to their next gate to catch a plane.  So there I was behind two old ladies, one in a wheelchair, trying to navigate off the plane and up the ramp.  When I finally reached the concourse there was no one there to answer questions or provide transportation to connecting gates.  Read the monitor they said, it will be fine they said.  I did so.  Being a 100 percent disabled veteran, of course my connecting gate was at the far reaches of the other end of the concourse.  No ride, no help, but we adapt and overcome right?  Hurried the best I could with my back in knots and legs buckling, I made it to my flight as the last person was boarding.

Switched to another aircraft, towed out of the maintenance hangar.  Boarded after another hour.  Plane was being fueled, but new ground technician made an error in balancing the fuel.  Had to unfuel one side and move jet fuel to the other to balance the plane.  Finally pulled back after an almost added hour's wait.  Moved out to taxiway.  Pilot came on to say plane in front of us (also American) had a radio failure and was not airworthy.  Had to be towed aside because ""no way we can back up and go around him.""

Good side:  our Captain kept us fully informed every step of the way with honesty and sincere apologies for not ""providing a level of service you should rightfully expect.""

Although price used to be a Southwest strong suit, depending on the market you are traveling out of, their prices are no longer as competitive and sometimes exceed the other majors.  Also, Southwest's open-seating policy can be very disconcerting for those who like to know that they have a specific seat of their choosing prior to boarding the aircraft.  This is further complicated by two abuses perpetrated by many customers, about which Southwest does not appear to be taking any actions.  The first is the so-called ""miracle flights"" (a term a first heard from a Southwest flight attendant) whereby large numbers of individuals pre-board the aircraft in wheelchairs only to be ""healed"" in-flight so that they can scoot out of the plane as soon as the forward door is opened.  The second is the ever growing practice among certain customers to purchase one ""Early Bird"" ticket in order to board early and then save numerous seats in the forward rows for the remainder of their traveling party.  Both of these abuses are efforts to avoid the potential of getting a ""bad"" seat, while avoiding the charges associated with purchasing the products that grant early boarding (i.e. Early Bird and Business Select).  Making matters worse is the fact that Southwest does not address these abuses head-on and the additional fact that Southwest continues to raise the price of Early Bird boarding, thus incentivizing more individuals to behave in a manner so as to avoid the financial burden while still ensuring a premium seating location.  I witnessed both of these practices in full swing on my recent Southwest flight.  However, at this time, although I have moved some of my travel business to other airlines, I remain a regular Southwest customer as their flight schedules continue to meet my needs.","{'neg': 0.087, 'neu': 0.828, 'pos': 0.085, 'compound': -0.4256}",-0.4256

They promised that the new children's area would be finished by the end of the year. We are travelling again tomorrow, and have just found out that there is still no children's area or place to heat/serve food. To me it seems completely unbelievable that such a major airport can offer no facilities at all to families with young children for such a long period of time. For the many families travelling through it must be a very stressful experience, and I know that I myself am dreading having to spend a few hours at the airport with an active 3-year-old.

The plane landed at 5pm, but due to congestion we were not allowed to disembark until 6pm. Since I knew I wasnt going to have much time, I downloaded the Mobile Passport App to make immigration faster (I had very good experiences with the App in ATL and JFK). However, when I noted to the staff at immigration that I had submitted mine through Mobile Passport, she rudely said that they ""weren't doing that"". Thankfully the line for US citizens was short and I was out of there in 15 minutes. I followed the signs for connecting flights and had to go through security to get to the main gates, which didnt take long. Unfortunately, when I got the gates and I checked to screens to confirm my gate number, I noticed that my flight was not posted. I asked a friendly staff in the information kiosk and he informed me that I must be at the wrong terminal and I had to take a shuttle to the correct terminal and get out of the airport and go through TSA again. I panicked since it was 6:15pm and my flight was supposed to start boarding at 6:20pm. I arrived at the correct terminal and spoke with a staff member at the exit and she advised that indeed I would have to go through TSA again. When I told her that my flight had started boarding she said Yeah, youre definitely going to miss your flight. Once I arrived at security check I looked for the TSA pre-check line (which I have) but didnt see it, so asked the person directing everyone in line and I also mentioned that my flight had already started boarding and he said Youre probably going to miss your flight but just enter here and ask the staff at the front if you can go in the priority line. When I arrived at the front of the line before the boarding pass check, I asked the staff member if I could go in the priority line since my flight had started boarding and she said no, sorry!. I started panicking, so I asked if the fact that I have TSA Pre-Check made a difference and she said uhm, TSA pre-check is on the other side and pointed me to it. I rushed over to the TSA pre-check area and was able to complete the security check in 15 minutes, which compared to everything else in this airport, it was a breeze. Finally, the inefficiency of this airport worked to my advantage and although I arrived 5 minutes after my flight was supposed to take off, there were people still boarding the plane. Moral of the story, I just came believe I had so many staff member telling me that I was going to miss my flight, but none tried to do anything about it. I also dont understand why the TSA pre-check line is so hidden that not even the staff members know where it is.

-0.2917,2020-03-01,2020-03-01,20.0,Delayed flight with poor service,"American Airlines Flight 2312SXM-PHL2:40-7:13 pmBoeing 757-200Although we recently had a good experience on American on our way from Philadelphia to St. Maarten, the experience on this return leg a few days later was definitely not the best. It was emblematic of frequent inconsistency in American’s service from flight to flight.We woke up on the morning of our flight to see that it was already showing a one-hour delay at 7:00 am, with the aircraft appearing to be delayed leaving Boston on its way to Philadelphia and then St. Maarten. I don’t know why that first flight of the day was delayed, but it seemed to be due to something within AA’s control, since the weather was perfect in all of the cities where the plane was going that day. The delay continued to build, and by late morning, we knew that our flight was now estimated to depart two hours late. Luckily, we were able to arrange a late checkout at our hotel and push back our transportation from Anguilla back to St. Maarten.When we arrived at SXM that afternoon, the lines to check-in at the American ticket counter were very long, although an employee opened an additional line shortly thereafter and sent us into it (while others who had been there longer stayed in the longer line), making our wait go down in length considerably. The staff member who checked us in was nice, and asked if we were aware of the flight delay and updated departure time. Once we had dropped off our checked bags, both the security and emigration lines at SXM were relatively short, largely because we were delayed beyond the time that most flights for the US leave each day. Once we found the gate that was indicated on our boarding passes, I was surprised to find that there was no staff there, and the TV monitor at the gate was turned off, rather than displaying our flight to PHL as the next flight. Because American had two flights to the US around the same time, one to Philadelphia and one to Miami, a lot of passengers were wandering around the small terminal area kind of confused about where to go. An announcement was made shortly after the aircraft arrived, confirming that it was the correct gate and announcing that boarding would soon begin.I was glad that we didn’t have to take a bus from the gate to the aircraft, which can be required at SXM depending on where the aircraft is parked. Our plane was right outside the gate, so we were able to walk right over and go up exterior stairs to board. However, one problem was that stairs had been set up in two spots: one set at the mid-cabin where Economy starts, and one set at the very back of the Economy cabin. Passengers were getting on from both sides, with bottlenecks created when people needed to get to seats in the opposite direction down the aisle or were having trouble finding overhead bin space. It was definitely a long boarding process, and even once the aircraft doors were closed, it seemed to take an inordinately long time to finally push back. We ultimately departed about two hours late, even though I think the delay could have been decreased a bit if the boarding process had been more efficient.One thing I found irritating about this flight in general was that the delay was never really acknowledged. Not once at the gate or on the aircraft was an announcement made that explained why we were delayed or simply apologized for the inconvenience. It was totally ignored, as if wasting everyone’s time and causing missed connections is no big deal. The announcement from the captain at the start of the flight neither acknowledged the delay nor gave us any pertinent information that you normally receive at the start of a flight.We had paid to upgrade to Main Cabin Extra (MCE) seats with extra legroom, and the legroom was definitely sufficient. However, as we’ve found on this aircraft before, the seats were very short and uncomfortable. I’m 5’9” and my head was sticking well above the top of the headrest, which wasn’t very comfortable, and it made it feel like the seat was miniature in size. The old 757s also really show their age in the bathrooms, which look absolutely ancient even when they’re somewhat clean.In-flight entertainment consisted of the standard set of movies and tv shows that you could stream through aa.com on your own device, and old monitors hanging in the cabin every few rows showed a movie and then a bunch of sitcom episodes throughout the flight. The seats also had power outlets between them, which I didn’t even try to use since I find that they often don’t work.Service on this flight was very inconsistent. One flight attendant was very nice and professional, even offering to get us wine from the First Class cabin when we asked for it and there was none left in the Economy beverage cart. Another flight attendant was not particularly nice, and the third was downright rude. On multiple occasions, she snapped at passengers for no reason. A passenger in the row in front of us asked her if she knew how to operate the power outlets between seats, which seems like a reasonable question. She was incredibly rude, telling him that the outlet is probably just a cigarette lighter outlet (it’s definitely not) and when he said he was having trouble since he can’t see it below the seat, she was very snarky in snapping back with “do you think I can see your outlet either? cookies or pretzels?”  It was a totally rude response for no reason. I would think from flying all the time, most flight attendants have at least some idea of how the features of the aircraft operate, and even if they don’t, a good flight attendant would be much kinder.  The same flight attendant was very snappy and rude when preparing the cabin for landing as well, yelling at both myself and my wife that we had to put away our keyboards on our iPads, which are simply part of an iPad case and clearly not a laptop that needs to be stowed. It’s unfortunate that rude flight attendants can ruin the experience even when others are doing a great job. Two complete drink services were completed during the flight, which was enough for a 4.5-hour flight. For food, a choice of Biscoff cookies or pretzels was offered, along with food for purchase. We used the online pre-order option to pre-order a couple of sandwiches before the flight. The flight attendant who was serving the food was the rude one. She acknowledged that she saw we had pre-ordered something, but couldn’t remember what we had ordered and didn’t want to look, so she asked me to tell her what we wanted. I was happy to do this, but it seems to defeat the purpose of a pre-order if the flight attendant isn’t actually checking to see who ordered what and making sure to hold those items for those passengers. We tried the Zoe’s Kitchen hummus and wrap (which was actually quite fresh and good), as well as a more basic turkey sandwich that came with a chocolate chip cookie. The turkey sandwich was a lot more basic and not nearly as good as the hummus wrap. Both options served as a decent lunch, though, and were generally worth the cost.The flight itself was otherwise uneventful. We ended up arriving at PHL about 90 minutes late, having made up some of the delay. A lot of the other people sitting around us were panicked about trying to make it onto connecting flights, since the flights they were connecting onto were going to be the last ones of the night. After we had already landed, one of the flight attendants did make a half-hearted announcement asking those whose final destination is PHL to stay seated so that passengers with connections could get off first, which I am always happy to do. However, it felt like the announcement was made much too late, and it was given without any real direction. I’ve found that announcements like this only seem to work when done earlier in the flight and coupled with more detailed information, such as the specific rows that have tight connections or a list of specific destinations that have tight connections and need to get off first. Another option is not to turn off the seatbelt sign immediately when reaching the gate, and specifically telling those with tight connections to get up first before turning off the seatbelt sign for everyone else. Either way, they didn’t do a good job of letting connecting passengers de-plane first.AA staff members were waiting for our flight after we got off and were walking toward Immigration. They were asking each passenger which connecting flight they were on, and if it was not possible to make the connection, they already had boarding passes for a flight the next day and a voucher for a hotel room ready to go. Although we weren’t connecting, it appeared that pretty good service was being provided for those who had to spend the night at PHL. Immigration was very quick, since we were one of the last international flights to arrive that night. However, checked bags took a very long time to show up at the carousel, which led to further frustration from connecting passengers in particular, who saw their chances of making their next flight vanish. I just don’t understand how American was not fully prepared for this flight with baggage handlers ready to go, when they knew we were coming in late and knew that there were people with tight connections. The lack of proper acknowledgement of and preparation for the delay (other than having the new boarding passes and hotel vouchers waiting) was crazy to me. Overall, this flight wasn’t great. The 757 aircraft was very old and needed to be retired ages ago, and the service was inconsistent.

I got there later than desired, but was still going to make my flight. However, as I was going through the Tsa screening (I had my stuff on the belt, next in line to go through security), my lane and a handful of others stopped operating. This was around 5:00pm on 10/18/2019 The TSA officers made no attempt to explain to the people in line what was going on. Instead, the officers in my lane kept laughing and cracking jokes about ""the supervisors not doing their job"". They should be more sensitive and considerate of all the anxious people waiting to get to their flights. One guest in the lane next to mine remarked that his plane was leaving soon and he might miss his flight, to which the officer sarcastically replied, ""That's unfortunate."" without even giving the guest a glance. Another guests 2 kids had passed through the security gate right before the machines stopped, so he approached the officer after about 10 min and asked if the kids could come back through to stand in line with the parents so they wouldn't be waiting alone. The same officer mentioned above replied in an aggressive manner that ""they've been randomly selected and they'll be selected again when they come back in."" What he's saying is not wrong. It's how he said it that rubbed me, and undoubtedly the father, the wrong way. You could tell the father was annoyed because he simply didn't want his kids to be alone. My negative experience was mainly due to 1 or 2 officers, but there is obviously a work culture that tolerates this kind of behavior. There were other officers around that said nothing to correct the abovementioned officer's rude behavior. I have traveled a lot in my life, and can deal with a bit of rudeness, but this was over the top. Please, train the officers to be better people, which in turn will make them better employees.

He said thats where he was told to stand so she shouted well now Im telling you to stand over there ao you go stand over there Even if its a connecting flight, LAX require all luggage to be picked up and then taken to another area for it to be checked in to the final destination.

My family of six went to check our bags.  We had two bags overweight by only 5 pounds.  We had room in the other bags, but when we packed we attempted to put most of the weight in my husband and my bag since we are traveling with two autistic children and wanted to make it easier on them from a sensory prospective.  They told us that we would have to shift stuff to the other bags.  The only place to do this was on the dirty floor.  Meanwhile, they were talking about having no more cleaning supplies (Lysol wipes) so if the counters around them weren’t clean, I really didn’t want to sit on the dirty floor.  We asked to speak to a manager.  There were 3 employees standing around.  One went to get a manager. The employee came back out and said they were in a meeting and would be out when done.  Meanwhile one of my autistic children started having a meltdown from waiting.  I asked the employee if she could try to ask them to hurry given our circumstances and her response was that “their employees have stuff to do too.”  The manager finally came out and said there’s nothing he could do.  If we could get the weight down to 52 lbs, he’d be fine with it.  I explained that still required us to get on the floor.  He had no solution.  Meanwhile, my husband was trying to talk to employee to explain about my sons autism and she put her hand to our faces and said “we all have things going on.”  Since I wasn’t going to put my family at risk and didn’t want my son to continue to have to wait we paid $150 for the luggage.  It makes me so sad that they had total disregard for our situation and I don’t plan on flying with them again without some sort of apology and reimbursement.

On my return after arriving in LAX and re-checking my bags, I wanted to standby for an earlier flight from LAX to SFO (it was a multi city booking).  I had called the day before and was told I could confirm at seat for another $75, and after an hour with customer service, was told there was an error message and I would have to do this in LAX.   At the re-check counter they added me to standby, but if I didn't make the flight I was facing a 5 hour layover.  I went to the lounge to wait.  And was told that First from US to MEX is not counted as eligible for the Lounge. Because they couldn't accomodate me in the lounge with a potential 5 hour layover, I was left to sit on the floor (the gate was packed) beside the gate waiting to see if I was approved for standby.  With 23 seats open Delta offered no preference for a full fare flyer, I was not guaranteed a seat until minutes before take off, and while it was exit row (my in the air exp is another story), the airline still gave me no priority boarding status. My recommendation: Never pay full fare for first class to MEX.  I'm from Atlanta and always favor Delta over other airlines, but this experience was extraordinarily disappointing, particularly after paying full fare for first (not with miles).  In the air:  LAX to MEX on Dec 25 on the 7p flight offered coursed dinner service, but the flight attendant on this 3 hour flight gave us all of the courses on one tray. They also let everyone in coach use the first class head until well into the flight.  It feels snotty to mention this now and also did to ask the flight attendant to close the curtain, but on the other hand, this is exactly what I paid for.    The seats do not go flat and there are no privacy screens between seats. On the return MEX to LAX at 935a on Jan 4, service was equally scant but they did limit the head to the passengers in first.  I miss the days of champagne offered before take off and warm nuts served once in the air.  Same seating style - just larger than coach reclining seats.  LAX to SFO: 3:10p on Jan 4, middle seat exit row - surprisingly good legroom and seat width.  So there's that.

For most screening took 1 hour and 31 minutes in marked contrast to the clearance procedures which argue for procedures of less than 15 minutes. Dozens of passengers failed to fly on their plane due excessive delays where the screening and CPB lanes in terminal A averaged a minimum of 1 and 1/2 hours to get passengers through to their departure plane. Meanwhile, in the same airport, the Canadian CBP perform these exact same checks on people travelling in Canada. The average time to clear their process this week was only 4 minutes and 11 seconds. Strong praise should go to the Canadians, for performing this task 22 and 1/2 times better than their American Counterparts.

There is no aspect of the experience there over the past two years that has been pleasant or helpful. On 25th November I decided to use the multi storey to park at terminal 1. I was dropping my son off with a guitar we had just bought, and wanted to make sure he got it past the check-in ok. I drove up the ramp to park and at that point, past the point of any return, and found a barrier blocking what had been the entrance to the car park, and a diversion sign. There were two staff members some distance along and when I drove up to them they explained that this was the first day of a new process under which only pre-booked cars could use that car park. (Good luck with that-my experience of pre-booking that car park has been that it is still very stressful trying to find a space.) They directed me to another car park, using a pre-printed card which they showed me but did not hand over. I could not find it and ended up parking at terminal 3 and walking with my son back to terminal 1, but I still had to pay 3 for 1 minute to get out of the car park I hadn't been allowed into, plus an additional 4.50 for the 21 minutes at terminal 3. So 7.50 for 22 minutes. This is nothing more or less than gouging in my opinion. The security process at the airport is appalling-it was more pleasant going through Checkpoint Charlie in Berlin before the wall came down. I've done both.

It was difficult to hear which gate was boarding which tiered class and there was some obvious confusion among passengers. The second strike against Delta came when I realized they didn't follow the typical boarding process. Usually airlines board you by groups so it becomes very obvious if you're the next group to board. Delta, however, has basic, comfort, premium, and some other tiers. Unless you frequently fly Delta, you're probably going to have a hard time finding out if you're next to board or not. The flight, otherwise, was smooth and we arrived on time. I didn't dock any points for this next comment as this isn't Delta's fault. As a passenger, make sure you disembark the plane in the same order as your seats. Trying to get ahead will only make the process slower. Are you about to miss a flight? Guess what!

During this time another flight attendant came and also said that she haid found two seats for us in the front of the cabin and Abigail told her no that she would prefer to move the lady with the cat instead so the other flight attendant left. Abigail then statted ro the lady dont even worry about it, you will have a better seat anyways. I then asked Abigail if she could take the lady around the other way as she moved her up front so that she was not directly walking past me and she declined. Abigail proceeds to tell me the the cat is already underneath the seat so it does not matter if she walks by with the cat. I then attempted to inform her about flying dander that could trigger our allergies. Abigail continued to be argumentative and stated no she will not walk on yhe other side, the cat is in a carrier. I then replied that it doesnt matter and Abigail again replied that the car is already under my seat so I should have no other concerns. She then took the lady up front. During the flight my breathing was shallowed and i had to take my rescue inhaler two times during the flight. My mom also had two seizures triggered by allergies as well. When I attempted to hit the call light to notify the flight attendants that my mother was having a siezure it took longer than 4 minutes for someone to come. When someone did come they did not ask if she was ok but simply if she would be able to complete the flight safely. I reported thag ahe would be fine but requested that a wheelchair be available at landing as her left side was temporarily paralyzed. Also during the flight Abigail was one of the servers on my side and often times completely overlooked me in supplying things. I would have to ask other flight attendants to get things for me. She also hit me several times with rolling carts. I am not sure if this was intentional but guven the history I would mot put it past her. I also overheard her telling another crew cabin member that my mother and I were trying to make the lady with the cat feel bad. I believe that my interactions with her were racially motivated and were completely unprofessional and unnecessary. Never flying this airline again.

Please note that the temperature outside when we arrived at the airport was 100+. I brought a bottle to refill with water. Both drinking fountains near the gate were inoperable. I walked further down the terminal and came to 4 other drinking fountains. Nothing but a dribble came out. It was hard enough to get a sip of water but was impossible to fill up a bottle. This is ridiculous and leads me to believe you are forcing me to spend $3 on a bottle of water. It is time to update your fountains, first with ones that work and secondly with the bottle fillers that are offered in most 21st century airports. Secondly, the men's room near gate A2 had 4 soap dispensers none of which had any soap.

Checked bags. Got to gate and received an email at 448 that our 530 flight had been cancelled. Went to ticket agent and was told all flights are booked and next available flight is 5pm. The cancellation was due to weather flight was departing at 530am..cancelled due to fog in Chicago. A flight at 630am left logon and arrived on time to Chicago. They say it was weather so then why wasn’t the flight delayed or why weren’t the other flights flying into Chicago delayed or cancelled from southwest? Southwest reps said it’s their policy to not be able to accommodate people at hotels when a flight is cancelled because of something out of their control. No accommodations were made for me and my 10month old. We were expected to stay in the airport for 12 hours. I asked for a hotel so that at least my 10 month old could rest and I could pick up some food for him. Again it was told to me their policy is that they can’t do anything for these circumstances. Southwest, yes you can you just don’t want to. No one helped me to find another solution. No hospitality was provided no one went above and beyond for a very stressful mother. The expectation was for my 10month old to stay in the airport for 12 hours, very hospitable! I found a flight leaving from tf green about an hour and 15 mins away from Boston. The flight was due to depart at 12:30pm. I decided this would be better than waiting in the airport for 12 hours. The ticketing agent put me on that flight and we were on our way. After incurring extra mileage and gas and a very tried and hungry 10 month old we arrived to tf green. We now will have to pay 60 dollars for parking when we were already accommodated for parking in Boston. Our return flight is to Boston and our car is in providence. We will have to take the train or bus to providence and lug our 2 checked bags and our infant with us. After speaking with numerous people at Southwest customer service they provided us with $200 in love vouchers. They did not accommodate our bags to tf green and they will not pay for transportation to tf green. I asked why they weren’t able to do these things and why they weren’t able to get me on a flight to tf green and they said they can’t do that. I responded yes you can you just don’t want to. He (Rod) couldn’t say anything and finally said well our policy..and continued to tell me about policy. The right thing to do is to properly provide service recovery for a customer who has had a great deal of inconveniences. He said they will fall short of my expectations because they will not give me what I expect. As a hospitality professional for over 12 years you never tell a customer that your services and company will not meet the customers expectations. You may fall short but that’s when you go above and beyond to make it right.","{'neg': 0.034, 'neu': 0.936, 'pos': 0.03, 'compound': 0.2722}",0.2722

An efficient agent should have announced those needing to make a connecting flight have priority, and then got them to the front of both lines.

I was recently in a position where I had a connecting flight and was put on standby and left to sit around the gate even after the plane had taken off just to be informed I would not be put on the flight, and if I managed to get on the next one I would be stranded in Arizona overnight for possibly 3 whole days. I had only ever agreed to originally being on standby as the person who booked my ticket had assured me I'd be on the plane, so I can understand what the other reviewers are talking about when they comment on confusion among staff.

At 1:40pm, while I was in route to check-in I received a message stating the departure was changed to 4:50.. which was subsequently changed to an hour earlier.Given the ups and downs of all the time changes for this flight, a restless mob of passengers boarded the plane.  My wife, my daughter and I boarded in the B group as the angry mob in front and behind us pushed their way into their seats to get to Boston reasonably close to the expected time.  My 10 year-old had a separated shoulder so I was carrying her carry-on along with my own. The flight attendant in the attached picture said something but I was not sure she was talking to me or what she said.  She then made it very clear I was only allowed to bring one carry-on and she was extremely rude in the way she said it.I was quite puzzled as all three of us had paid full fare for this flight and had a preconceived notion that Southwest was friendly to customers.  In any case, I was the last one to exit the aircraft and as the pilot and customer services team was boarding the aircraft, I asked why I was not allowed to bring a carryon for myself and my daughter.  The customer service representative then said she should have carried her own carry-on or checked it in..  I was just stepping off the plane and then I stepped back to say maybe you do not know all the facts and he yelled for me to exit the aircraft.I don’t believe TripAdvisor shares true bad experiences with people so I reluctantly took the time to share this; however, within 10 minutes of arriving at my hotel @ 10:31pm I sent a note to the president of Southwest, Gary Kelly.  I was then overwhelmed by phone calls in the morning from his office to clear this off their to-do list..  I told the person who called I was on route to a meeting and passing through several tunnels where I was unable to hear him.. he did say he was sending a $50 gift certificate and “he considered this issue closed.”As I told this person, I was not in a position or place to talk and I did not consider this issue closed.  Yesterday, I visited the Texas Children’s Hospital so my daughter could see the Adolescents Sports Surgeon who is overseeing her rehabilitation, who reminded me not to let her do any overhead activity.. so, I attach a redacted letter from one of Houston most renowned medical facilitates and physicians stating she has/had a separated shoulder and will be receiving physical therapy into 2021.

Rental cars are insane distance away. Then the walk to the rental car pick up shuttle is just as bad. TSA is slow and the agents care more about who did what last night than moving things along quickly. They are among the most unfriendly in the country. I always fly Southwest out of BWI. Either to there or changing planes. They also have the distinction of having the most unfriendly southwest agents working the gates. Attitude and could care less about customer service. If this hub changed I, as well as a great number of road warriors would welcome the change. I use other airlines as much as possibly now to avoid this airport. And you want attitude or poor customer service. Get a cab at the airport to one of the hotels in the hotel zone. Yeah, maybe i dont want to wait in the weather for a shuttle bus. God Forbid. The cab drives are rude and will have meltdowns when you tell them where you are going. I tip hefty and would have done more for them than most...but not when they cop an attitude.

Even tho not required to let airlines know, I advised them of having a service dog because I am deaf and requested a bulkhead seat.  I have travelled previously to Mexico, Honduras and Nicaragua without incident. This was different as my 53# lab was so cramped that my feet had to rest against the bulkhead wall or ON TOP of his body.  I objected and asked for a CRO.  Her solution was to get another flight but she had no idea what day or when that could be accomplished.  Oh  yes that sounds like a wonderful idea!  The man sitting next to me did not want my dog to lay his head on his feet and CRO told me I would have to leave and get another flight.  I asked to upgrade to first class but was told there were no seats.  Finally the passenger in aisle seat agreed to sit in middle seat and the guy who didn’t want my dog to rest in his space moved to the aisle seat. I really wasn’t upset with him...he has a right to have his space.  I was humiliated and so upset with this handling of a situation.  The airlines suggested that I should book 2 seats next time.   Wonderful idea for someone with limited assets....hey why not leave a seat empty when a elderly disabled passenger who has advised you that she requires the use of a “real” service dog, (and has utilized your airlines with this same animal on previous trips without incident) plans this trip 6 months in advance?

However, the chaos began as soon as we arrived at the Miami airport. My ticket was pre-check as we thought all four would be since they were all booked under my name as the lead person. We were instructed to go to the two different check-points. After being turned around twice, I informed the young lady that we had gone through this twice. If we had to come back, a manager is going to have to get involved. She instructed us to go back to checkpoint three because the staff member there was new and didnt know what she was telling us. We went back, and sure enough, the staff member began to tell us to separate again. I told her what the previous employer had said to us, she pulled up our ticket on her phone and told us to go ahead. I couldnt believe the level disconnect of communication here in the United States; there is a lot to be learned from Liberia Airport. Courtesy and politeness from the employees for starters. We finally arrived at our gate for departure. As we sat there trying to listen for the changes of gates. The intercom system is not the best; one could barely hear the changes. We saw so many travelers missing their flight and upset, as they should have been. The announcement should have been clear, and anyone on that flight name should have been called before that plane departed. I felt bad for those that were unable to hear the message in the mist of all the chaos.

I headed for Passport Control and was told to stop and wait in a corridor to the Passport area. I waited and waited for 90 minutes along with several other people, most of whom complained to the staff on duty within an hour. Announcements came over the intercomms that the passport control area was very full and they were trying their best to clear the backlog. The area where we were queueing was a corridor less than four metres wide, with at least 50 to sixty other people off the same flight. This area was very hot and became unsafe, so much so that we were offered free water whilst we waited. Several other planes and putting it bluntly we were discriminated against. Although we had the necessary ESTA documentation to enter the States we along with many other passengers had to endure watching passengers rush right past us and enter the passport area to be processed whilst we had to wait in line. Many of those waiting missed onward flights thanks to this policy. After 90 minutes (roughly) we were allowed into the processing area. 30 plus finger printing machines were there for us to use. So after a nine-hour flight, ninety minutes waiting in a very hot area we were given the task of taking our own fingerprints. Now I understand English perfectly and read the instructions perfectly, but would the machine take my prints - no. I then checked the screen below where my fingers had been, it was dirty, greasy and covered in what I assumed was sweat. I pointed this out to an attendant. There were just two helpers at the time trying to control this area and barking at the passengers. Two helpers for 30 dirty fingerprinting plates and people from all over the world not understanding the instructions walking around puzzled, bewildered and disenchanted. So wondering what germs or microbiological virus I would pick up from this experience I transferred to a different machine. Eventually, I obtained a piece of paper with a large X across it. I had failed my first test to get into the USA, now I was being barked at again being ordered to another queue about two and a half hours after my landing in the United States. After three hours I was given the all clear by a United States Customs Officer in a little booth, with his own fingerprinting machine that eventually, although just as unclean as the previous one agreed to read my fingertips! This was a very bad experience. Despite many complaints by my fellow passengers, many of whom were fellow Brits, we were discriminated against. The young customs officer who eventually allowed us into the United States stated: We are getting new machinery soon. This experience which I can prove beyond doubt will mean I will never travel through Seattle again. I found the people nasty, barking at us, talking to us like we were thick and shepherding us around like sheep. I assume that anybody who lives in Seattle or works there would also be disgusted if they saw how people visiting their city for the first time ever were treated.","{'neg': 0.071, 'neu': 0.848, 'pos': 0.081, 'compound': 0.4034}",0.4034

And at having to find another driver... and pay them to drive us! I feel there should be some money paid to us because of the inconveniences and the time lost at the resort. Oh and i also made arrangements for a driver from the AP to the resort and return trip back to the AP and that also had to be changed prior to our trip also. I feel we paid a lot of money for the flight, i chose the flight times that Delta Gave and were best for us. I can’t remember if we paid extra for those times but we may have. I don’t think i will consider using Delta for few of them doing this again.

Having travelled extensively, contributing to the healthy economies of a large number of countries, I can safely say this tax refund system and premise to be the absolute worst, even surpassing Pariss CDG many times over. Common sense dictates more counters required for expeditious service, better ventilation (!) in a bigger area, toilet facilities, seating areas for the elderly and those with children and properly functioning lights (basic requirement!).

Assured that my party would arrive in Orlando in plenty of time (around 10:30 am) I reserved a dinner show which had to be pre-paid. I received notification in late August that Southwest had eliminated the direct flight to a connector in Baltimore which would arrive in Orlando at 12:50 pm. My dinner show being at 6:15 I was unhappy and called the airline to get back my direct flight but was told the flight had been eliminated. I asked for an early bird option gratis to compensate for the lost direct flight but was told we do not do that. In Baltimore we were delayed not once but three times finally arriving in Orlando after 3:30 pm. The transfer from the airport to my resort was another 45 minutes (this is standard). We reached that destination after 4:00 pm and were told that the free Disney transportation would probably not get us to our dinner reservation on time and had to hire a cab at an added expense of $43.00.I have flown Southwest several times in the past but now am considering other options.

My flight to Vegas was great, after the app gave me the option to upgrade to Comfort+ seats on the way there. These seats were so wonderful and the flight attendants were great that I decided to try and book them for the flight back a few days in advance to make sure I'd get them again.I logged onto the app about 12:30am and saw multiple seats available but when I tried to purchase I received an error message that said to try again later. I tried again soon after and received the same error message. I decided I would try again the next day. However, when I logged on the app, it only offered first class upgrades at 3x the price so I figured I'd check my CC account to see if comfort+ went through. There were two pending charges on my account so I called Delta to find out what's going on.After almost an hour delay for response, they tell me they don't see those seats available on their end and that it is just a double charged hold on my account since I tried to book seats that ""were not actually available"" They said others must have booked them all (about 10) during the night after I tried and before I tried today. After much discussion back and forth I asked if I could get the first class seats for that price, due to their app causing this issue. The supervisor said they would not take less than full price for first class. Now, I get the airline wanting as much money as possible, but I spent a decade in customer service and building that loyalty for long term use should come first. If they came back with even half price for first class, which would still be more than what my pending charges are for comfort+, I would have been willing to negotiate since I get it is another step up from what I was /am? Paying for. But no, straight up full price only and sucks to be you is how they handled it.The most they could do is put a note on my name saying I am interested in Comfort + seats and (supposedly) when I get to the airport, if two seats become available, I can purchase them at full price there.I will be checking my CC account again tomorrow to be sure that those double charges for seats that were not actually available to purchase come off my account. If not, I guess they will get another call from me. It's sad that after a great trip there, I'm left with a sour taste for this airline on the return.

I travel quite frequently for work and Detroit Metropolitan Airport (DTW) is one of the most ridiculous places I transit. This airport seems to consider itself some sort of luxury shopping experience instead of a place to board or change airplanes. Walking through the airport you will notice large selection of expensive name brand stores and high priced restaurants. You will also notice a sever lack of quick and useful concessions. I can't speak for all travelers, but I myself rarely have time during my 1 hour connection time to have a nice sit down dinner at PF Changs and then do some browsing at Swarovski Crystal. What I do have time for is to stop at a food concession that will have my order ready in a reasonable amount of time and maybe for a nice cup of coffee. Neither of these is a possibility at DTW. The severe lack of of basic food/beverage concessions is appalling. Any concession that would be considered ""quick"" is never quick in DTW. The biggest reason is because of the lack of options the lines at the ""quick"" places is often out the door and these places are generally understaffed. On example is the Starbucks located in the A terminal. There are 2 Starbucks for 76 gates, each staffed with 2 under motivated individuals. I have seen lines with over 20 people in them while not surprisingly the Hugo Boss store next door is completely empty. Detroit Airport needs to figure out its true purpose. The purpose of an airport is to provide paying passengers the opportunity to get a bite to eat and a coffee while attempting to make a connection that has most likely been reduced because of weather or some other reason.

If you have to make a decision like this, it is on the logistics and scheduling/reservation elements of Delta...not the customer.  Don't overbook a flight, and then disadvantage a customer because the reservations team can't balance the load. Secondary to inconvenient change above is how Delta now communicates with the customer via the automated attendant.  Delta's system is woefully inadequate!   Automated call attendants are frustrating, but Delta has now taken it to a new level.  You reach a certain point in the Delta communication process where you are told they cannot answer your call.

Oh well, there always seems to have be at least ""that one"" in airports. However, while I've never had particularly negative experiences, this airport is still not easy to like or embrace. It's clearly outdated, outmoded, and overused, if you've ever watched ""Home Alone,"" which came out in 1990, I'm pretty sure the airport looks today just as it did in 1990 (and even earlier). The airport is dirty all the way around and not well taken care of, even smelling what I can describe as dank and damp in certain areas. Gate seating is not ample. While there are plenty of dining and shopping options both pre- and post-security, many of those options have a sort of dingy feel, no matter how well run they are and how friendly the staff are. The lighting and flooring suck, and even the sporadic display of attractive, futuristic-by-1980s-standards artwork doesn't change that fact. Even though the area of Chicago in which O'Hare is located is generally nice and middle-class, the CTA (Chicago Transit Authority) train station below the terminal has a strangely uncomfortable feeling - and the station and CTA trains are just filthy, even though the station is less than 30 years old (that's CTA's fault, though). Back upstairs, ride shares take longer to arrive and drop off than at many other large airports, even when things aren't particularly crowded. In all, O'Hare provides a poor introduction to, and representation of, an otherwise friendly, vibrant and unique city called Chicago. What a shame.","{'neg': 0.123, 'neu': 0.742, 'pos': 0.136, 'compound': 0.4981}",0.4981

The way I am being treated is very upsetting, and its obvious they don't care about retaining loyal customers, for that reason I feel the need to inform and warn anyone who will listen, in hopes that they choose wisely(Southwest is greedy and insensitive).  I cancelled my flight on Saturday 2/22/20, at 11:00 am., due an emergency (unforeseen circumstances).  The flight was scheduled to leave from Atlanta (to New Orleans) at 2:15 pm.  After signing on and performing the cancellation, I clearly saw the message that stated ""Flight Cancelled  $309.00 rewards were credited.""  I later received an email stating I was a no show.  I immediately contacted customer service, who provided me with another so called customer service number in Dallas, who would be able to assist, problem is the offices were opened M-F 8-5. I immediately contacted them on Monday morning and explained the situation, what a waste of time.  The associate basically said SORRY we get to keep your money.  Maybe there was a confirm button that you did not press and you should have taken a screen print.  Not to mention - I am the highest level of escalation.  I was baffled; this was not a $59 wanna go fair.  I don't have that kind of money to give Southwest Airlines.  They are basically kicking the can down the road to basically say SORRY we get to keep your hard earned money.  I was not asking them to give me anything for FREE, I was merely asking them to credit me for a future flight - which is typically their policy.  This is disheartening that I would be treated in such a matter of fact manner, by an airline who is clearly one of the most profitable.  They cannot expect to treat customer this way and expect to gain or retain customer share in the long run.  They really not care.  Honestly GREED has taken over this airline.   I recently flew them once for a business trip to NYC and there was one plane that was stuck in St. Louis due to weather (3:00 PM) and I was told there would not be another flight until 6:00 AM the following DAY!

Make sure you have 2.5 hrs or more. The customs alone took about 45 min. I still had to claim my baggage, recheck them and go through security. I mentioned to security that I was late for my next flight and I was transferring. The guy said they don't expedite passengers (and yet many of the good reviews for their airport says they do?) so thats a complete lie. He nicely suggested I could ask others if I could cut. Here, sadly, its common for people to be asking others to cut at security because they are late for their flights. To be fair, so far no staff were rude, just indifferent. But one young guy near the right side security conveyer belts (right before the scanning machine), when I asked him what should I do, grinned and rudely said ""its not my problem"". I didnt have time to get his name. I had only 5 minutes to get to gate 90 (yep, the one at the very end) and had to run with all I had. Once I got to my flight 1 min past the boarding time officially ending, the crew was nice enough to still let me on.

At the start of our trip, we had to change Terminals but, even though we had allowed 2.5 hours between flights, we missed our connection. The airline rebooked us on a later flight with the comment that people are seldom allowed enough time to change Terminals. After the inbound flight it didnt take long to collect our bags but things started to go wrong immediately we set off for the other terminal. We knew, from a little prior research on the Internet, that we would need to take the train. The trouble is there are no clear signs to the trains when you want one. The train makes 3 stops: Terminals 1 & 3 and Viscount - this a car park. Stop announcements are not made so you dont know which stop you have arrived at. Moreover, signs are in English as well as French which is a puzzle since French is 15th in the list of common languages spoken in Toronto. Given that my wife is MENSA qualified and I am retired aircrew I am surprised it took us long to realise that International Departure and Domestic Departures are signed by a picture of a Globe and that of a Maple Leaf thereby avoiding normal lettering used throughout world airports. I suppose this is a brilliant idea to overcome language problems but it doesnt work because Maple Leaf emblems are everywhere. After landing we both headed for toilets only to find the queue for the ladies 20 deep across the walkway and a line in the mens because there were only 2 urinals. Between floors the elevators are nowhere near large enough with the result that shins are banged into by carts. To add to confusion one double elevator is covered in an advertisement but is not identified as an elevator. Its true purpose is given away by the call button. Nowhere is there a sign informing how long it will take to walk to a Gate and directions are not often repeated. I had intended to take my hosts a bottle of whiskey but by then I was in the Domestic Terminal which does not sell alcohol. When we eventually reached our gate there was less than 45 minutes before departure and so insufficient time to accept our hold luggage. On our return we deliberately allowed 10 hours to change Terminals. Even though we had experience of the procedure it still took a couple of hours. We then discovered that we would not be allowed to our airside lounge until 4 hours before departure. To recover our composure we decided to have a drink but we couldnt find a bar or restaurant; however we managed to buy a coffee but then couldnt find anywhere to sit or place a boiling hot cup. In fact there is no seating area nor anywhere so, at the suggestion of the airline, we left the airport for a room in the conveniently located Sheraton. Later, we again set off to drop our bag and then find the lounge at Gate C32. Thanks to use of my iPhone I discovered that this lounge is located as far as possible from the Gate and would take us half an hour to walk. There are no signs informing of this. Once at the gate, I thought it would be rather nice to buy a t-shirt for my 9-year old grandson in the shop. There were plenty to choose from but not emblazoned with an interesting picture of Canada. I could find only those promoting some sports logo known to few outside Canada.","{'neg': 0.062, 'neu': 0.871, 'pos': 0.066, 'compound': 0.5472}",0.5472

","  | Oh, where to start. I've been through Riyadh airport (apparently the worst in the world) during a blackout and had a better experience than transiting through LAX. Twice. Both times 4 hour layover, first transit waited for almost 3 hours at immigration and had to run to make my flight. About a third of fellow passengers missed their connections. There were 3 or 4 officers checking passports and another 15 or so mall cops standing around barking orders and generally being unhelpful. Return trip, went through immigration in about 15 minutes but was then told by three seperate employees to go to the wrong terminal. The last was 'Information' desk who told me, with rather shameless dismissiveness, not to worry that my flight wasnt on the departure board. Then went through security to find, surprise, surprise, I was in the worng terminal. There is no information desk airside, eventually had to accost some maintenance workers who kindly made some calls to direct me to the correct terminal. Why this was so hard is incompletely beyond comprehension. Note, I had checked in at the time if my first leg, so gate details were not on my boarding pass. Eventually got to the gate to find people flayed across the ground - for some reason the gate had no seats. By this stage the overwhelming incompetency became comical and I had a good laugh. There were another few terrible encounters with outright obnoxious staff at LAX which on another day I would have cared more about. Allow at least 4 hours for transit and also meditate or pray beforehand (depending on your disposition).

Essentially the seat moves forward making space for the seat back to recline, no more does the seat in front of you recline in such a way that you cannot leave your seat to go to the bathroom.

I don't mind having number A37 on line. The problem is that it's actually more like A90. Let's not forget that, if the person in the chair is traveling with someone, they can get on at the same time.

We won't be spending that with American Airlines anymore, and will be diverting our future travel plans from them for both business and leisure.The flight home to Detroit from PHX (an easy flight for most airlines) was a nightmare. The air was off upon entering the plane, turning the inside of the cabin into an oven. Everyone was incredibly uncomfortable.  After sitting on the tarmac for 45 minutes after departure time, we had to rock at the terminal again for maintenance issues (their planes look and feel VERY old - see their ashtrays still on the seat arms). After sitting another 30-40mins (and the AC being turned off again), we were forced to deboard. They eventually ushered us to another plane saying it'd only be a few minutes. That time changed again and again, becoming further delayed. As we we're boarding the second plane, the agents forced my wife to check her bag. When asked why we had to check it this time when her carry-on had fit previously, we were told very bluntly and without apology that the plane was a different design and we'd have to get it at baggage claim. We had really been trying to avoid this since we needed to get home early so we wouldn't have to pay the sitter for overtime and have full-time jobs to get to early in the morning. We get on the plane, and there are many bags that are much bigger than my wife's tiny carry-on - some of which was large photography equipment.We were told we'd be leaving at 3:30pm, yet I am writing this review from the terminal docking area and it is almost 4:30pm. Still waiting, and hoping to leave.In closing, American Airlines is an out of date and discourteous airline. This is not the first time we've been burned by them, but it will be the last. I will not have my sales teams take their sub-par planes anymore, and I will not travel through them for my personal trips either.

I know this isn't in Orlando, but some might be lured by the lower prices to use this airport instead of flying direct to Orlando. We have just used it, and saved 1600 for a party of six, including two children, into the bargain. But was it worth it? Well yes, I suppose it was, but the transfers within the airport itself is pretty dire. There are four terminals, BA arrive in Terminal 4, the hire cars are in Terminal 1, which involves a bus ride and no means of transferring luggage other than to carry it. Luckily we were only doing it one way, on the way back, as our BA flight to FLL was cancelled and we flew direct to Orlando on the 4th February instead of the 3rd to FLL. Bear in mind we are four adults, two children aged 5 and 2, five cases, sundry handbaggage and two car seats and you can see the problem. Ten dollars for two trolleys from the car hire drop-off, up one floor, and outside to the bus. A bit of a scrum, everybody is carrying large amounts of luggage trying to get on. The bus driver did his best, no doubt illegal with the amount of cases stacked on the floors because the racks were full. So round to terminal 4, another ten dollars to get two trollies to wheel into the dparture area, a total of about one hundred yards. You can walk it apparently, but it would take about twenty minutes.

Our flight was scheduled to leave at 6am, so we arrived a little after 4am. We breezed through check-in at the Delta counter with zero issues. Everyone was kind, professional, working efficiently, and quickly checked our bags in, printed our boarding passes, and directed us to security. A quick trip up the escalator and we were greeted with an enormously, annoyingly excessive long security line. Though the electronic signboard stated the minute-long wait for TSA pre-check, priority boarding, and regular, they informed us all lanes were closed but regular. This was was the first major slow down. Next, there was a large number of TSA agents per customers, the majority were dry, cold, and lacked professional courtesy/basic customer service (and some were just straight up rude) as they pushed people through this single lane and barked repetitive reminders about the speed in which to walk past the dog, etc. We are frequent flyers and have seen many other airports use the police dogs much more effectively than Newark. Why cant they take a page out of JFKs or DCAs policy and just keep the line moving at a normal pace and have a lane for the dog to pass everyone? This was the second major slow down. We finally get to our security scan belt around 535am, knowing our flight is already boarding. They switch out TSA people to watch the screen, which stops our line. They yell over and over that nothing may be in a bin except large electronics and edibles. Again, the cold, curt way in which we were spoken to was unacceptable. We finally make it to the scanner and Im randomly selected for additional screening. That didnt take as long as I thought it might, but again, Im now fearful Im going to miss my flight that takes off in 15 min. No one cares. That was the third slowdown. We get through security to then be yelled at to take our shoes to a bench to put them back on... why cant anyone show a bit of kindness???? Meanwhile, nearly everyone was passing, in front of or behind, us complaining about how horrible security was today. Why would they not open until 430am knowing people are scheduled to board 6am departing flights at 530? We made our flight but did get to the gate after boarding had already begun. I will be doing everything in my power to avoid the Newark airport for future travel and will tell my friends and family to do the same.","{'neg': 0.065, 'neu': 0.859, 'pos': 0.076, 'compound': 0.6186}",0.6186

I had to either mail it in for a flight I wanted (in which case they could take up to 2 weeks to process and risk there being no more seats on the plane) OR make a reservation on hold and then go to the airport.

The attendant gave me back a photocopy of the voucher to use for another flight.  I haven't been flying due to COVID, but I did write the airline for an extension, which they granted.  I reserved another flight yesterday and went to the airport today to use the rest of the voucher, along with the printed copy of the AA e-mail from them.  The counter attendants would not even look at the e-mail and would not take the photocopy, even though it was one of their attendants there who gave it to me (and I've been carefully guarding it ever since.)

They were the RUDEST airport personnel I have ever dealt with.

Delta is SUPER easy - there is a number on the voucher that you enter when you book a flight, and just keep entering it until all the money on the voucher has been used.I have taken my last flight with AA and the company seems not to realize that poor customer service in this day of social media will hurt them a LOT more than honoring my last part of the voucher for a fairly inexpensive flight.","{'neg': 0.056, 'neu': 0.876, 'pos': 0.069, 'compound': 0.6304}",0.6304

OK, I guess, for the 2nd reservation as we never re-booked, but the 1st one was cancelled & re-booked literally w/in 3 hrs. One phone rep told me we should get our $40 credit, another in a diff department said ""no"". Turns out we had to change the flights on the 1xst reservation to what we wanted on the 2nd rather than re-book on a different itinerary as we did. Wasted $120....which will definitely come into play when making future reservations on SW for sure.","{'neg': 0.064, 'neu': 0.86, 'pos': 0.077, 'compound': 0.633}",0.633

I didn't want to tell the person in front of me to please refrain from reclining their seat because it probably would have caused a situation on the flight.

As all of us have had numerous changes in our lives related to covid-19 and continue to experience uncertainty as changes are daily and often extensive. My daughter's university closed and she was forced to leave campus. We determined it best to have her come home as soon as possible. She has a dog. We made flight reservations, when she arrived she was told crate would not be accepted. We were able to make a flight change for the next day. Now 2 nights stay in a hotel, and the purchase of acceptable AA approved crate- she arrived again at the airport this morning and was told now unable to fly with dog because temp in Boston was expected to be below 45 deg. I called the airlines to beg them to reconsider as given the uncertainty and potential at some point for further restrictions on domestic travels and/or assistance with alternatives- the first women I spoke with Linda, told me there are no alternatives per their rules with regard to pet travel. I explained the situation (my daughter has no housing, Uof A- Tuscon is now closed for the remainder of the semester and  her friends are gone). Linda told me quite inappropriately that my daughter's ""dog would die on the plane so she might as well just let the dog go at the airport and get on the plane"". My second call to a customer service rep, now with a request to either get refund or credit as I am not a meterologist and temps to any airport in the northeast are quite variable this time of year, and again begged for consideration  due to significance of current circumstances with covid-19 - they refused stating rebook from yesterday to today constituted my ""1 covid-19 waiver"".  I fully understand rules are rules but with these incredibly extenuating circumstances, one would think compassion would exceed profit and rules. Neither I nor any of my family will again travel via American Airlines. I sit home in CT planning my drive to AZ as I am unable to lose further money with airfares to try to get my daughter home all with the fear that further travel restrictions are looming.

Got to the ticket desk 36 minutes before our flight. Cutting it close, I know, but the Austin isn’t that big and I have TSA Precheck. The ticket agent told me I was past the bag cut off for my flight. Well, fine. Guess my bags will go on a different. Flight. No, she says. We cannot separate you from your bags. She removed me from my flight. Told me I was on standby for a 10am flight, but I probably wouldn’t make it. I was booked on a 1pm flight that was already delayed until 2:30. Oh...and my bags would go on the 10 o’clock flight whether we were on the plane or not thus...Separating. Me. From. My. Bags. Which is precisely what happened. She offered no solutions to book a different route. No offer to “hey, you better hurry. I’ll let the gate know you’re coming but they may not be able to wait.” Fine. I’ll Usain Bolt it to the gate and if I can’t make it, well that’s on me.Made it through security and had I hustled I would have made it to the gate with 5 minutes to spare. Unfortunately I didn’t make the 400 hard dash since I had already been removed from the flight.This one desk agent’s decision and lack of help cost me 8 hours. EIGHT HOURS. I didn’t get out of Austin until 2:30. Other American Airline employees were lovely. Then I emailed customer service. I received polite correspondence that explained their policy and a 45 minute bag cut off. I had to ask for some compensation. They gave me 7500 miles. I didn’t miss my flight! Their employee removed me from my flight with 36 minutes to go!Terrible. Absolutely terrible.  Through my correspondence with customer service they seem to reinforce the policy of ordinary. “It isn’t that simple.” “Our policy is.” “We recommend.” Look, just one that your agent had a chance to be a hero and hurry up and get me on my flight and instead just opted not to.

I headed for Passport Control and was told to stop and wait in a corridor to the Passport area. I waited and waited for 90 minutes along with several other people , most of whom complained to the staff on duty after an hour. Announcements came over the intercomms that the passport control area was very full and they were trying their best to clear the backlog. The area where we were queueing was a corridor less than four metres wide , with at least 50 to sixty other people off the same flight. This area was very hot and became unsafe, so much so that we were offered free water whilst we waited. Several other planes arrived and putting it bluntly we were discriminated against. Although we had the necessary ESTA documentation to enter the States we along with many other passengers had to endure watching passengers rush right past us and enter the passport area to be processed whilst we had to wait in line. Many of those waiting missed onward flights thanks to this policy. After 90 minutes (roughly) we were allowed into the processing area. 30 plus finger printing machines were there for us to use. So after a nine hour flight and ninety minutes waiting in a very hot area we were given the task of taking our own finger prints . Now I understand English perfectly and read the instructions perfectly, but would the machine take my prints ? .NO. I then checked the screen below where my fingers had been, the finger plate was dirty , greasy and covered in what I assumed was sweat. I pointed this out to an attendant. There were just two helpers at the time trying to control this area and barking at the passengers. Two helpers for 30 dirty fingerprinting plates and people from all over the world not understanding the instructions walking around puzzled, bewildered and disenchanted . So wondering what germs or micro biological virus I would pick up from this experience I transferred to a different machine. Eventually I obtained a piece of paper with a large X across it. I had failed my first test to get into the USA, now I was being barked at again and being ordered to another queue about two and half hours after my landing in the United States. After three hours I was given the all clear by a United States Customs Officer in a little booth, with his own finger printing machine that eventually, (although just as unclean as the previous one) agreed to read my finger tips ! This was a very bad experience. Despite many complaints by my fellow passengers, many of whom were fellow Brits, we all felt we were discriminated against. The young customs officer who eventually allowed us in to the United States stated We are getting new machinery soon. This experience which I can prove beyond doubt will mean I will never travel through Seattle again. I found the people nasty, barking at us, talking to us like we were thick and shepherding us around like sheep. I assume that anybody who lives in Seattle or works there would also be disgusted if they saw how people visiting their city for the first time ever were treated.","{'neg': 0.064, 'neu': 0.856, 'pos': 0.079, 'compound': 0.6713}",0.6713

They couldn’t get the Auxiliary Power Unit to connect properly to the air craft. Stuff happens however the communication from Delta’s gate crew was less than ideal. They did not notify us of a delay until after the boarding time had come and gone, they started out with a 20 minute delay, then it was 15 more minutes, then 15 more minutes, etc., the app and flight tracker were a better source of information. When they finally got it working, we had to wait for the aircraft to warm up. Then we boarded and someone was sick all over the seats, needless to say the cleaning crew had to come on, however at no time did they tell us why we were delayed. They didn’t say anything until the cleaning crew were finished. When we landed they had boarding passes for some of the delayed passengers but not all of the delayed passengers, so some of us had to get in line with Air France to get our boarding passes. They did give us a coupon for 15 Euros for food. The communication from Delta left a lot to be desired. By time I arrive at my final destination I will have been traveling for 24 hrs. Stuff happens and sometimes it is beyond the control of the airline, what separates the good from the bad is how they handle it.

Gates 1, 2, and 2A are located behind their own security checkpoint which doesnt have TSA Pre-Check. I am a business flyer and carry an extensive amount of electronics in my baggage, all of which had to come out (in their own, separate bins) to go through the X-Ray. Also had to remove my liquids which took forever. The security line moved extremely slow due to the lack of separated TSA Pre-Check, so arrive early. Once through security, you are guided into an extremely overcrowded waiting area with very limited vendors (similar to MCI, you have to go outside of security to get something to eat).

To top it off, I had my cell phone on the back seat support to watch a movie, and the passenger in front of me abruptly reclined, knocking my cell phone off, knocking my drink off, right into my lap. I had a soaked down lap for the rest of the trip. Reclining seats cause more issues than they are worth, so I would not built them in! Flight attends were too busy to bother with me.

I feel it lacks a common framework, some kind of unified criteria, when it comes to passenger service. It is such a big airline that it really depends on whoever is working at the terminal or on board that day to provide passengers with professional assistance. I have seen quite a few unfriendly boarding moments at Delta, sometimes the welcome coctail arrives, sometimes it is only a word on the menu. But there is one thing Delta does everytime they fly: to generate tons of single-use plastic and paper waste when they could go much more sustainable. Safety can no longer be the excuse. It is time to change. If flight attendants stopped giving out two paper towels by mistake instead of one, or none, every time they serve you a drink, guess how much paper they'd save. Do you really really need to wrap the bread buns and the pillows and blankets in disgusting plastic? Keep calculating... Refleshing paper-towels? Could we find a less-disposable passtime? Do you reuse the plastic plates where food is served? Did you know that most passengers would be more than happy to keep that plastic glass they are offered for the entire flight instead of disposing and replacing them every time they drink? Be a pioneer company and set the example, Delta.","{'neg': 0.074, 'neu': 0.834, 'pos': 0.092, 'compound': 0.6818}",0.6818

It was the departure that was frustrating. We made it to the airport in good time - about an hour before take-off, made it through the first ID and boarding pass check quickly. Then the security bit. The TSA agents were flat out rude. Not only were they getting frustrated and unnecessarily annoyed with a woman who clearly did not speak English (after they asked her to do something 4 or 5 times and then getting progressively angry with her I finally had to tell them she obviously doesn't understand), but there were tons of them doing absolutely nothing. Both our bags were held because I had saline solution that I knew needed to be tested and my partner forgot he had carried in our water bottle. We and 2 or 3 other folks sat at the end at the security check point for (and this is a rough estimation) about 10-15 minutes before anyone started checking bags, but there were security people sitting around. Talking with each other. Standing around. And all the while our plane is about ready to begin boarding. I was furious. After waiting another 5-10 minutes for our bags to be checked and for my partner to go through security (a second time) with their water bottle we were finally able to make it to our gate. The guy who looked through our bag was nice, but it was like no one knew what their job was that day! Overall I hope I never have to fly out of this airport again.

Service was okay, food was stone cold, and the ""free drinks"" included in the price was only one and that was with dinner.  I couldn't even get a second cup of coffee! The flight back was about the same. Delta has added a cocktail to their economy service and menus.  Still couldnt get a second cup coffee.  The flight staff was grumpy and I was reprimanded for trying to didpose of my menu before the last snack, the male flight attendant even pulled out the from the rubbish and handed it back. I will save the additional $500 and suffer the crap flight in cattle class. Now if you want a better class of service fly premium economy fly BA or Virgin.","{'neg': 0.06, 'neu': 0.835, 'pos': 0.106, 'compound': 0.6988}",0.6988

It was utterly shambolic and I have spent much time over the years arriving into US airports. This particular arrival is up there amongst one of the worst ever. The passport machines rejected over 90% of all applicants and help (though not needed by myself) was not readily forthcoming at all to other passengers; when another passenger asked for assistance she was told, ""no, not my problem. You should read it properly"" by a staff member. I was in another lengthy line for just over an hour after receiving a cross on the paper from the passport machine. Out of the many desks available for use only two were open that particular evening and there were no other officers around. What never helped matters either was having the airport greeters walk up and down the line with various accoutrements attached to them like clipboards and radio handsets (to show how important they are no doubt) telling passengers that it is not their fault and not the fault of the officers either!. At least the immigration officer I saw was friendly particularly when he realised that I shared the same birthday as he. Departures through Terminal D back to LHR has nothing much to write home about in terms of restaurants. Would suggest that you eat elsewhere before arriving here. Not many seats around the gate area of D7 either.","{'neg': 0.051, 'neu': 0.872, 'pos': 0.077, 'compound': 0.6996}",0.6996
