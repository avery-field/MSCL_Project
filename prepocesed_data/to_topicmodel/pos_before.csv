As a frequent traveller, to lots of airports, this one is pretty bad on the face of it. Disorganised would be the operative word - 4 check in staff for about 200 travellers, 3 of whom were looking after 1 set of travellers for some time. Glacial movement on the queue and when you see people being pulled out of that queue because they are about to miss their flight, then you know the check in isn't going well. Also the first airport I have been asked to step out of one queue for security (with 30 or so others) and then walk about 500m to a completely different security spot downstairs as they were unable to cope with the numbers. Considering so much of Hawaii is about tourism, they certainly aren't wasting money on improving the arrival/departure processes.","{'neg': 0.059, 'neu': 0.845, 'pos': 0.096, 'compound': 0.711}",0.711

The airplane was a few minutes early but no marshaller available as I remember from my days operating in to the London airports as a pilot. Nothing new. Then nobody to operate the single jetway. When staff arrived it took three dashes up and down the jetway before he was able to make it work? Then the survival trek to immigration and a 1hr wait in the long lines. I am semi-disabled yet there were no carts at the head of the jetway. I saw one passing and he refused to stop although only carrying one person. On the back it said that the electric cart had to be booked 48hrs in advance. Where the hell did they get that idea from or don't any of the management travel? At Canadian and US airports ""comfortable"", golf carts not plastic boxes, run around the terminals all the time and are normally waiting for any long haul flight. At immigration, once I got to the desk, I found a very pleasant and charming young lady who was most helpful. That young lady was the best part of the trip other than going home again! Then to fight the hoards to get out and find a rent car? The rental car company was the usual rip-off as normal at any UK airport. Would not extend my booking at all but insisted on a new reservation at 6 times the original rate! Now for leaving! Ride the Conga Line through the expensive and hot duty free. What a joke. Then find a seat and try and read the departures board. Who invented those things? I had just passed my First Class pilot medical yet had trouble reading them. Finally the flight was called, WestJet 002, October 24th, to gate 54. On arrival I found a long line already there and no seats outside of the boarding area where agents were in place but not letting people in. I finally asked one agent who was passing what about disabled people and she allowed a few in. Then to the boarding process! No announcement for families with kids, old folk and disabled, just open a barrier and let the hoard rush down the ramp.

This past year, however, has been a rough one. I don't remember the last time this year I took an on-time Southwest flight, to the point where it's an ongoing joke that I tell whoever is picking me up not to schedule a time to pick me up until I'm physically on the plane. It's all fun and games when I'm flying home to see family or friends, but I fly monthly for my job. My entire company books flights exclusively on Southwest, and it's no longer funny when our team members are constantly delayed getting where they need to go. I understand that you need to be flexible when traveling, but what's the point of spending money on an airline that is so frequently unreliable? Not to mention counter staff and flight attendants who, because they missed their true callings as comedians, feel they can cover up poor service with humor and bad jokes. It isn't funny. I've always been a Delta hater but they've had my back this year when I knew I was on a tight schedule because I know they can be on time. Moving into 2020 our team (and myself) are looking forward to making an airline switch.

I spoke to the cabin crew and the Purser and to be honest they couldn’t have cared less, I explained that if I could have my leg raised I may be able to avoid hospitalisation on my return to England. They literally did nothing, no support whatsoever and consequently when I landed in England we went straight to Bournemouth hospital where I remained on IV antibiotics for five days. I must stress that this might have happened regardless of the outcome of my request on the plane but I was highly disappointed with cabin crews response to my request.

You can’t lift the leg rest up high enough, so it feels like your body wants to slide diagonally down to the floor. Lying flat was very uncomfortable as the seat was very narrow and my feet didn’t fit in the compartment. I had to keep them in the same position the whole time.I would much rather have the old-fashioned wide first class seats. I will try to avoid flying in this plane in the future. The armrest was also very narrow and the tray tables were awkward to take out and put away. It was like a puzzle. I don’t know who designed this, but it was not thought through.

I see him talking to the staff he on his cellphone and then he try’s to get the flight attention to take his credit card and was told no and to go to his seat. By know the door to the plane was closed. This tall man walks to where we are sitting and my son ask him are you sitting with us he said yes. We got up so he could get in to the Windo seat. We begin to talk about that I was trying to get the delta app to work on my iPhone to look at the movie playing on this flight. He tell me that he was having trouble with the app to he was going to trie to upgrade his seat he had ask the gate person if they had any first class open she told him yes we do so he explained to me that it’s a little cheaper if you do it when you get on the plane but he was having trouble with the Delta app so he asked the flight attendant to change is card . She told him no for him to go to his seat. He was not happy but he said I not going to worry about it . So my son and I get up to let him get in and we take off . After we get the all clear to use the bathroom he tell us I need to be leet out so we all get up to let him out . He explained that he will be making more trips to the restroom in the 3 1/2 hour flight did we want to change seats that he would be okay with it so we did we put him on the end . He has a beer and we have the best time just talking about life and our kids.

Some people are first time flyers. Be patient, be helpful, do your job. help educate them so next time things can go smoother. Next  allow families/groups to stay together. When one attendant is pulling one-by-one from three different lines, the person or people I am traveling with could be very far behind me. This is not conducive with groups of minors. It can be scary and allowing them to stay together is a small courtesy that could be extended to help out. Teach your workers patience. It was terrible here.

I contacted Delta and literally within a 10 minute conversation that was understanding and extremely professional they had agreed to waive the change/cancellation fee and send me vouchers. The contrast when I contacted Jetstar(subsidiary of Quantas) and Asia Air was like night and day. I received no refund, voucher or chance to rebook within a year.

0.7436,2020-02-01,2020-02-01,20.0,Mechanical Defects from hell,"This was the worst flight ever. I have been a loyal Delta Customer for several  years, but this experience has shaken that loyalty.To make matters worse, our flight from Greensboro to San Juan at the beginning of our vacation was delayed due to a mechanical problem as well. Even though we were able to race to the gate in Atlanta arriving about 5 minutes after the scheduled time for departure, Delta did not hold the flight for us or any other passengers making the connection.  We missed the connecting flight in Atlanta and were rerouted to San Juan via JFK in NYC!!! Instead of arriving at 2 in the afternoon, we arrived at 8 PM at night missing a half day of our vacation. But back to the awful experience of Flight 599 that was scheduled to leave San Juan at 3:20 in the afternoon on 2/29/20.  We boarded the plane on time. Then people noticed a liquid dripping from the right wing. Soon thereafter the pilot came on the intercom and explained that there is a value under each wing that is used to drain water from fuel tanks. He said, ""Nothing to worry about, Water is heavier than fuel oil and migrates to the bottom of the tank. ""  However, a short while later, we were told that they decided to drain the fuel in the right wing and transfer it to the left wing.  This process created a small risk of fire so we had to exit the plane.  So we all exited this big plane which took about 25 minutes.As we crowded against the windows in the concourse, we saw men in hazmat suits and fire engines around the plane. It did not look good. More time went by and we were told that the valve was broken and needed to be replaced. Some people used their phones to try and book alternative flights with little success. Friends with whom we were traveling were able to book a later flight from Atlanta to Greensboro when it became obvious that we would not make the original connecting flight. I tried but was unable to rebook our Atlanta connecting flight.As it was getting close to dinner time, snacks and drinks were brought out for us. This seemed like a good idea at the time but in hindsight, it was not.   About 6:30 or 7 PM we were told that there was not a replacement valve in San Juan. One would have to be flown over from Atlanta. about a 3 hour flight. Our estimated time of departure at that point was maybe 10 PM. They then brought out sandwiches, but we were never offered a meal voucher. I, like many people, had eaten too many unhealthy snacks. I wish we were offered the sandwiches or a meal voucher initially.The pilot was very gracious and apologetic. He did his best to keep us informed. About 8 or 8:30 PM he told us that his crew's time was up and a whole new crew had to be found and flown from Atlanta to San Juan. He strongly encouraged us to stay with the flight. Although some people were rebooking flights for the next day. The pilot assured us that many people would greet the plane in Atlanta and have connecting flights information and, if necessary, hotel vouchers for us.The new expected time of departure became 12:30 am Sunday morning. While waiting for our flight to depart, I was able to book a flight from Atlanta to Greensboro Sunday morning at 8:30 am. We were upgraded to first class which we appreciated. We didn't depart San Juan until after 1 am Sunday morning. When we arrived in Atlanta there was one person at the gate. It was about 4:30 am. She was surly and worthless. She knew nothing about connecting flights or hotel vouchers. All she could tell all of us was ""go to the front of the airport.""  I have transferred planes in Atlanta numerous time, but I have never checked in at Atlanta, like most of the people on our plane. I did not know how to find ""the front of the airport.""  She could have said to ride the train to a certain stop, but NO"" all she said was ""Go to the front of the airport.""  I was not familiar with that term. She answered no questions. So we, along with everyone else, got on the tram and rode it to the last stop. As we took the escalator up, we realized we were leaving the security area. When we found the Delta counter it was about 5 am. There were, I think, three staff people behind the counter. Since we were in ""Comfort+ seats"" on the fight to Atlanta, we were one of the first to arrive at the counter. They knew nothing about our flight's delay. They were totally unprepared to be inundated by a host of upset customers. They knew nothing about hotel vouchers. They didn't know which hotels in the area would accept vouchers.  They had to call their supervisor. The bottom line was they strongly discouraged us from asking for a hotel voucher.   They could not give us meal vouchers.So what we had been told would await us in Atlanta did not happen.  Delta really let us down.  So we got our boarding passes for the 8:30 am flight to Greensboro. We had to stand in lines to go through security at about 5:30 am on little or no sleep. That was no fun at all. But we finally made it back to Greensboro safe and sound.

No delays. All pretty standard. Iberian BC is nothing worthwhile mentioning and we like the AA envoy seats better by comparison. But hey, safety and schedule matter most, right?As she arrived at ORD to switch to AA18 to CLT and finally be home after 20 hours of travel time, an AA issued boarding pass with express tag awaits her upon deplaning. With the boarding and express pass from AA in hand she runs through immigration, picks up the luggage and drops it back off after customs. All as swiftly as possible at ORD. Most US airports are third-worldish by global comparison, but IAD, PHL, ORD and CLT are among the worst. Anyways, by ORD-Standards the runaround through bus transfers, immigration, luggage, customs, drop-off and security, all go comparatively smoothly today. All just in a little under an hour and she’s at her gate to board the Charlotte flight. So she gets in line with the other passengers and as the ground agent scans her new AA issued boarding pass for flight 18 to CLT, the agent freezes, gets nervous, looks at the floor and states “we have booked you on the next flight”. Baffled, my wife is trying to get someone to explain what happened, but only gets muffled “...gave your seat to someone else...”, “...thought you might not make it anyways...”. “...next flight in 2.5 hours...”.Full it unbelief she asks if her luggage is on that plane and gets no response. For 15 minutes she watches everyone else board the plane, then the doors shut and she is left by herself, with 3 agents at the gate staring at the screen or floor, evading all eye contact. Finally she finds a supervisor who is completely baffled that my wife was holding a valid AA issued boarding pass for flight 18, checks the system on the luggage and finds that the luggage is on that plane. She assumes that my wife just appeared too late at the gate, but when finding out that she had been denied boarding and just left there standing for 15 minutes while the flight boarded, she could not believe it, apologized (first person who did not ignore my wife), and sends her off to the gate where the next flight would take off 2.5 hours later. Only after my wife asked which flight number and if she could get a new boarding pass, was she handed a new boarding pass - somewhere back in 21D. Well, at least she will make it to Charlotte eventually. We had hoped to have a nice evening together, but obviously some disrespectful and selfish, arrogant ground agent hat needed her seat for a colleague. That is how American Airlines treats it’s frequent fliers on international Business Class itineraries.

On our boarding pass, it said Terminal CE, but none of its signs stated that, it will state Concourse and a list of letters that did not make any sense to us, which was not helpful at all. Our flight was delayed by 5 hours because the captain was unable to arrive at the Miami airport due to the weather in Tampa, which is completely reasonable. However, the situation could've been handled much better. The people that worked outside the gate were unhelpful. They pretty much expected everyone to have smart phones and therefore were negligent in giving us, customers, regular updates as to when our flight will arrive. They only updated people who stood waiting in line for 15 minutes, instead of just efficiently announcing it to the general public, not that their updates were helpful to the individuals that stood in line because they kept pushing it to every hour, so it was very hard for customers to plan accordingly. By giving us an incorrect ETA, we were not able to decide whether to rebook to another flight or not. If we had known that the flight was going to be delayed for 5 hours, we would've gotten on a different flight. But the people at the gate kept ensuring us that it would only be an hour delayed, and then another hour if we asked again and again. This misinformation is unacceptable.

Logan Airport seems at first sight to be well organized for this - staff to direct you, electronic devices meant to speed up certain procedures, etc. However, there was a bottleneck situation the other day because 3 flights arrived at more or less the same time, and so it took all of 2 hours from the time I left the aircraft to the time I left the airport. This in and of itself is unacceptable, especially considering that it was mid afternoon and only about half of the posts were open. But even worse was the fact that many of the people in line with me were getting very nervous because they were afraid they would miss their connecting flights. However, when they asked if they could go through first, they were told it wasn't possible because everything had to be done on first come first served basis. The argument was that people who did not have connecting flights would protest and would never be served because in the meantime other flights would arrive. Not true because by the time I got through there were very few people still waiting in line. I for one would gladly let someone who is in a rush for a good reason go before me and I'm certain any sensible person would do the same. Other airports have staff available for the very purpose of directing people who have little time to catch their connecting flights. Why not Logan? It's a question of courtesy and common sense. And it's especially important here because for many foreigners this is their first experience on American soil!

Not DL or AF or any other airline Ive flown during my millions of miles of travel. Then they tell me to go to T2 to get my connection. I go out the door and into the elevator. The lounges are above. I go there. And no one will let me in. Im flying Business Class. A security worker sees this and says I am in T1, not T2. He says this happens all the time (probably because there are no signs). So, he walks me down to the transfer bus. And it wont take me from T1 to T2. I need to go through security again. Again, scanned, frisked, my infinitesimal paraphernalia taken out and put in a bag. Now I find out T2 is only accessible from the lower level. Upstairs are the lounges for T1. Where's the sign? The elevator opens onto another sad little bussing room to T2. I get to a lounge in T2 and Im told I cant come in. I ask for a manager and she apologizes and tells me I can come in because I'm flying Business. And my name is on the list. The lounge has a few seats, miserable food, no bathroom, but thankfully a self-serve bar which I made good use of. Total transfer time: 2 hours. Never again will I fly Virgin, AF, or Delta through Manchester and neither should you transferring through this airport is like traveling through all the levels of hell.","{'neg': 0.047, 'neu': 0.88, 'pos': 0.073, 'compound': 0.7594}",0.7594

At the end of the month my foreign exchange  student manuel was supposed to go on a trip with the foreign exchange program to Washington DC. We booked a flight through Alaska Airlines to go there and a flight with American Airlines to come back. The trip was canceled obviously and Alaska Airlines was kind enough to let him transfer the $135 ticket to somebody else's name since he will not be able to use it but American Airlines decides to keep the $355 ticket and won't let him transfer it to anybody else.He is going back to Spain today so obviously he cannot use that $355 it expires at the end of the year. I hope we don't bail out companies like this. For years they have been profiting millions if not billions of dollars off of high priced tickets and crammed seating with horrible customer service and during this worldwide pandemic they aren't even willing to make exceptions because it affects their bottom line, making money.We got denied on a refund which I expected, but you would think they would be willing to credit the money and let somebody else use it the way Alaska Airlines did.Shame on companies that are using this time to take advantage of customers.","{'neg': 0.048, 'neu': 0.878, 'pos': 0.074, 'compound': 0.7615}",0.7615

There were signs to mainland USA, but when I got to the sign where it said to take the elevator, there was no floor number to go to. So I just had to pick a floor. When I finally found Hawaiian check-in there was just one huge queue. No one knew what they were doing, half of the check in computers were not working, and then I couldn't even get a seat number when I dropped my bag off. Then security took 45 minutes, and the line was not that long. Finally got through security and had to walk a mile to find my gate.

Our departure experience is why I'm reviewing this airport. We got to the airport with plenty of time to spare because I knew from previous experience how long and time consuming security can be there. The first thing we did was stop at the rest room right by security. The people in front of us in line informed me there wasn't any toilet paper in the stalls. I was hoping they were misinformed but they were correct. There was no toilet paper. There was a woman with a TSA vest on in the restroom. Someone in the restroom asked her if she could let someone know there wasn't any toilet paper and she blankly looked at her and walked away. I was very surprised to see the security line wasn't very long! My 18 month old son has special needs. He has a feeding pump and has Cerebral Palsy therefore he is unable to stand or sit on his own. The TSA agent wanted our stroller to go through the conveyor belt machine. I told the agent I'd rather push it through so I would have someplace to set down my son while I gathered our things after they came through the belt. (I knew I'd have to hold my son but wanted to be able to set him down afterwards) She said no. She then took off all 3 of the stroller wheels and crammed it down so it fit through the machine. My son and I walked through where we were supposed to be and waited for our things. I had a backpack, laptop, my sons diaper bag, my sons feeding pump, my shoes, my keys, my phone, and my stroller without wheels to get after it went through the conveyor belt. So I'm standing there holding my son, who I can't set down anywhere wondering how I'm going to get all of this stuff back where it needs to be. Eventually I asked one of the TSA agents if they were going to put my stroller back together. I got a blank look and he went back to what he was doing. I then loudly said ""Someone better get over here and put my stroller back together"" and an agent put my stroller back together so I could set my son down and get all of our stuff. The staff I encountered during my time at Denver airport were not helpful. I originally flew from Minneapolis to Denver a week earlier and had zero trouble going through security. The staff at MSP was all very helpful and understanding. They let me push my stroller through so I could have someplace to set my son down. They helped me gather my things.

Thankfully, the State of Hawaii appears to be finally, slowly moving to revitalize this ancient relic of air travel, but who knows how long that'll take?! I've flown in or out of Honolulu three times, each time, I've been beyond underwhelmed, and it's legitimately hard for me to even think of anything positive to say about this place (as if you couldn't tell already). To elaborate: The layout had to have designed by a third-grader (and that may even be an insult to third-graders), illogical, seemingly lackadaisical, with unnecessarily long walking with little art work and shops along the way. Oh, and poor signage, as you're approaching and leaving the airport and within the airport. The exterior just looks little better than what I imagine a bombed-out set of the show M*A*S*H would've looked like, but at least there are some neat tropical plants here and there. There is no tram, which makes it horrifyingly handicapped-inaccessible to travel between security, terminals and gates. Few airports I've ever been to seem to have more intentionally curt, unpleasant personnel than Honolulu, whether they're check-in and ticketing agents, TSA, customs and immigration, Starbucks baristas, or bartenders. Security is astonishingly slow and ""un-methodically methodical"", even having TSA Pre-Check helps, but just a little. The only perk is the people who are wearing leis, and greet you into Hawaii with smiles as the plane is disembarking. Just avoid this place if you possibly can, it is easily avoidable if you're flying from the Americas or Europe, if you know what you're doing, but probably not avoidable if you're flying from Australasia or Asia.","{'neg': 0.092, 'neu': 0.79, 'pos': 0.118, 'compound': 0.7992}",0.7992

I was only there for a connection as I was travelling from MBJ- MIA then back to the UK. Customs in the UK is so simple and quite quick considering. The staff were so rude at customs in particular at security, they ignored you pretending they were speaking on the radio and couldn't hear. When we had to get our ESTA tickets it was a shambles as we had to do everything in 1.5 hours in time for the connecting flight. Instead of managing the queues one particular staff member kept shouting at me because I was using a different kiosk from my dad, which makes no sense because those questions were long so if there is a kiosk next to him it makes sense to use that - as I did on my way here 5 days ago. Other people were using more than one kiosk but she spent her time focusing on me instead of organising the queue. She kept shouting saying 'Mam Mam Mam' you can't use the kiosk, despite telling her 2 times our connecting flight was soon. The guy at customs was so rude, I'm sure that if you are travelling with a family member you're supposed to go up with them? But, we got yelled at and only my dad was allowed to go, I eventually went up and then a few seconds the customs guy called up another man who was after me - assuming he was my dad, I had to tell him we were not travelling together. In addition, we had to rush through security bear in mind by this point we only had 25 minutes left until we boarded the plane. My dad tried to ask one of the security women a question and she just pretended that she was listening to her radio and that it was so important, she didn't even acknowledge my dad. We kept telling them we were boarding in 25 minutes and no-one cared. Also when they give out blue cards when you go through security - the ones that determine whether you take your shoes off or not/take out your laptop. I just wanted to double check if I needed one as my dad got one and a few people before him did and she just shouted to 'go in that line'. Surprisingly we made the flight, and it was delayed by 45 minutes due to the manifest being typed up incorrectly.","{'neg': 0.042, 'neu': 0.898, 'pos': 0.059, 'compound': 0.8045}",0.8045

Check in was aided by a Southwest employee, from obtaining baggage tags, going to the counter to check the luggage and check in, the employee was with me, helping.  The next step took a little longer, when I had to wait for a porter to get me a wheelchair and take me through security, which was streamlined because of my disability.  I would never have been able to negotiate the long lines.Once at the gate, I was allowed pre-board status, my walker was tagged so that I could use it all the way to the door of the plane.  As a ""Customer of Size"" I also require an extra seat, i.e., my body will not fit between the arms of the seats.  To not impose on other passengers, you are allowed an empty seat.  I sat next to the window both directions and enjoyed the views.Once we landed in Nashville, it took very little time to get my walker up so that I could leave the plane.  It took a little while for the porters to get there with wheelchairs (there were five of us needing them on that one flight), but the porter took me all the way to baggage claim and even went in the back to try to get my bag from there.  He couldn't find it so I finally let him go.  My companion had met me from another flight, so we took it from there.On the return trip, the disability arrangements in the Nashville airport was not as well organized as in Houston.  We were told where to go to check in, but because we misunderstood, it was considerably longer than necessary.  Without someone walking us through the process, it was very confusing.  When we were finally checked in and baggage checked, we were sent to an area of chairs to wait for porters to help with wheelchair assistance.  Yes, it was a busy Monday afternoon, but there were just not enough porters around to help.  It took almost an hour before we were taken through security and to the gate where our flights were leaving.The return flight to Houston was uneventful, and the porters in Houston were numerous and plentiful, so it took no time to get my baggage and out to be picked up by my hotel shuttle back to my car.","{'neg': 0.038, 'neu': 0.906, 'pos': 0.056, 'compound': 0.8048}",0.8048

An area of weakness is the lack of information given by gate attendants at such times. Passengers were basically rebooking their own flights hoping to make reasonable connections. If you do not have the Delta app, for whatever reason, you are either at the mercy of the gate crew or you have to be assertive and re-book yourself.Once on board the crew is generally efficient.

As we were getting on the plane, Southwest is open seating so we were trying to find a seat together. There was a flight attendant named Gabrielle who was standing in one of the rows that had 2 seats together. We politely asked if we could sit down in those seats and her response was, ""You want to sit HERE, out of all the places?!"" She was so incredibly rude and it made my girlfriend and I feel like we were less then. I feel as though since Southwest is open seating we should be able to sit wherever we would like, especially since we wanted to sit together. The entire rest of the flight she checked on everyone around us in her section, but would skip us for some reason. We had to get the attention of a different flight attendant, who was more than attentive and showed us great customer service.

In my experience they have been the most reliable, timely, and friendly. I'd also like to mention that I hold some responsibility in our disappointment and write this review with suggestion for the airline. On Labor day weekend we traveled with two other couples to San Antonio with a connecting flight in Houston. Somehow, I booked the wrong connection and was instead on a flight that left 3 hours later, arriving in San Antonio at 10:00 P.M. As soon as I realized what I'd done, I checked in with a Southwest representative to see if seats were available on the earlier flight, and if we could switch. I was told the flight was only half full, however, we would be charged $900 to change the flight. This charge far exceeded our original purchase and seemed excessive since we had 200 miles remaining in our journey. Coupled with Southwest Airlines mantra of no change fees! I reached out to Southwest online and explained the circumstances but was told I had purchased a discounted fare and the no fee rule did not apply. From a customer point of view and as I saw my friends shove off from the gate on a plane with many open seats, Southwest Airline missed an opportunity to exceed in service by helping to solve a problem cause by an honest mistake. Instead, I received a message from Austin online saying ""sorry we can't help but thank you for reaching out"".  Simply, it seemed to be very easy to get us on the earlier flight since there were many seats available, and an opportunity to exceed our expectations was missed.","{'neg': 0.093, 'neu': 0.792, 'pos': 0.114, 'compound': 0.8191}",0.8191

Inbound: Entry can be a problem for visitors (I see the long lineups for Immigration/Customs (Canada does it in 1 step rather than the 2 of most countries which is one of the reasons for the many delays - overloading of manpower). Read other reviews I use the Nexus/Trusted traveler option so no delays here - about as quick as going through normal EU Immigration at LHR: which highlights the 'pain' that tourists feel at YVR. But, all that time saving at Immigration is for nothing since the baggage handling is so poor, and why it is not reported as such in other reviews. It is almost like the baggage handling is designed to make the Immigration department look good - ""my bag just gets to the carousel when I finally make it through Immigration"". Outbound, Pleasant surroundings but YVR is expensive to purchase anything (more so than LHR, FRA, AMS for example). For locals this is a real slap in the face since one of the specific promises made by the Government and the YVR Management Company to the citizens who (through the Crown) own the airport would be that they would have pricing comparable to downtown locations. Services provided are ok in extent, but too often the server cannot speak English, which is hard to swallow for a country with English as its official language and located in British columbia. I bet that European/African tourists shake their heads. On the positive side it would be possible for an Asian language tourist to find a server that speaks their language.","{'neg': 0.057, 'neu': 0.861, 'pos': 0.083, 'compound': 0.8236}",0.8236

It took about 20 minutes before we got to the TSA desk at which time they told us we had to leave and go to the other check point. We then waited in line another 20 minutes to get to the security screening in the second checkpoint line. Our complaint is that first the gate should be printed on the boarding pass as clearly the TSA counter had this information 20 minutes later. Second, there is no signage or employees going around checking to inform travelers they are in the right checkpoint. We all expect some wait at the airport but things like this are simply maddening! Further, when we talked to the TSA folks, they rolled their eyes like this is a very common thing and they wished it wasnt that way.

If it werent for the competitive international fares Im able to acquire due to routing through this airport, Id never come. My plane landed at 4:30a, closing out an all-night flight of 11-1/2 hours. We were first to Passport Control, but other flights also arrived and discharged their passengers. There were hundreds in line, and only one agent was checking in the sea of American citizens returning home. Airport staff barked directions at incoming passengers, but with no clarity or organization or apparent purpose, generating even more confusion and frustration. My husband and I were near the front of the line; still, it was an hour before our passports were cleared. Exiting Control we followed signs for Connecting Flights. The main Connecting lobby was closed, so someone shouted from the top of the escalator to come upstairs. Once there we had the pleasure of joining all the Departing Passengers - both those Connecting (like us) and those just starting their trips. We stood in long Security lines, were yelled at by TSA staff or rudely ignored, and ultimately had three of our five parcels inspected/rifled. The airline staff has been courteous and helpful and genuinely concerned with passenger comfort and safety. The JFK airport staff, however, is the complete antithesis. How embarrassing for all of us, knowing that millions receive this sorry treatment. Get your act together, NY. Future passengers, be warned. Maybe your experience will be a good one. Or maybe you, too will take away the degrading experience that was mine today.

There was barely any room for my legs and knees not to touch the back of the seat in front of me.

I had chosen an aisle seat because I thought I would have more room to move my legs and feet.

The attendants were great, and the flight was very smooth.  Weather was terrible in NYC on our return date, and Delta did a great job letting me know well in advance that the flight would be delayed so I could better plan when to arrive at the airport.  The only reason I'm giving four instead of five stars is that, en route to the airport, Delta texted again to let me know they'd moved UP the delayed departure time, which put me in a bit of a panic, as I assumed once the delay time was sent to me, that that was the new departure time; I didn't expect the plane to then change the time again to depart earlier.  That said, we still made it on the flight and the pilot made up most of the time en route, so, despite a 90 minute delay from the original departure time, we were on the ground only 20 minutes after the originally scheduled arrival time. Good job, Delta!I'm not a big fan of the censored movies (I can decide for myself if I want to hear swear words, Delta), nor of having to watch the provided entertainment on the screen of my own device with no way to recharge my device on the plane, but on a short flight it's a minor quibble.

If you book a flight & then later find the price for that flight has gone down, you can call & get credit for the price difference. You can also change your flight, no penalty, just pay if there is a price difference for new flight.

If you are not a US citizen, do not, I repeat, do not make a transit at this airport, you will not make it in time. Of the 6 times, I've arrived here internationally, it took an average of 1.5 hours just to clear the immigration checkpoint each time, with a maximum of 3 hours from personal experience. After clearing customs, all other airports that I've been to have your checked luggage up and out on the carousel in 20 minutes max. Here, it's at least an hour's wait so it doesn't even matter if you've cleared the immigration checkpoint quickly. Finally when you exit to ground transport, do not use the bag conveyor belt to deliver your luggage separately before taking the transit train to Seattle exit and ground transportation else you'll have to wait another 10 minutes for your bags to arrive by the conveyor belt after you've arrived by the transit train. This airport is not just understaffed, it suffers from very visible underemployment and operation inefficiencies. For example, the airport management has in their infinite wisdom decided to station not one but two workers at each luggage carousel to arrange bags neatly on the carousel as they arrive by the conveyor belt so that they don't tip over. This task is absolutely pointless - I've still seen bags tip over and being rearranged by other passengers standing beside it. So now you have two persons being paid to just stand by the carousel chit-chatting and occasionally moving a bag or two when they could be doing something more useful like delivering the bags quickly. All in all, too much waiting and a poor experience every single time. Is it too much to ask for an airport to do its job quickly so I don't have to stand for another 3 hours after a 12-hour transpacific flight? I've arrived in the US from LA and San Fran and both are much, much faster.","{'neg': 0.021, 'neu': 0.931, 'pos': 0.048, 'compound': 0.841}",0.841

The Southwest ground crew personnel were apathetic; I got more information from fellow travellers.Next, when word did get around, that for those of us left milling about our bags had been sent with the next plane, we crowded into the lost baggage office, spilling out into the cramped area next to the carousels.  No Southwest employee particularly took charge to give us the information; again, it was mostly being passed as word of mouth amongst us waiting passengers.4 Southwest employees were on duty, taking our details.  Since I opted to pick up my bags myself later in the evening, I was offered a voucher and told they would call me when the flight/bags arrived.No call from Southwest.  I called Southwest baggage a bit after that ""next flight"" was due to arrive and was met with mediocre service on the phone.  I hauled myself back to the airport, and the same 4 Southwest employees were there, with no other customer in the office.  2 had eyes locked on a screen, the other 2 doing something else.No one greeted me.  I announced myself, and was dismissively told to wait a minute.  I replied that I had already been waiting for more than ""a minute"" for my bags and had come to collect them.  I got eye rolls from the employee who did look up, but no apology for keeping me waiting then, and certainly no apology on behalf of their employer - Southwest - for keeping me waiting for my checked bags.This is when things deteriorated.  The youngest one of them started looking among the scores of bags sitting there by name tag, not thinking to ask me what size or color my bags were.  I went over to point out my bags -- and in point of fact, did point them out -- when a 2nd employee of the 4 came over and BERATED me for being in the area with the bags.  I half-jokingly asked if this really was Southwest Airlines, as it didn't sound like it!  That 2nd employee's attitude to me got worse, then dismissing me in the 3rd-person as though I were an inanimate object, told her ""colleague"" that she didn't have to answer me/help me as I have to show them respect!I wonder who does the employee training for Southwest ground crew at DCA, as they certainly skipped the lesson on showing the customer - paying customer - respect, and courtesy.  This 2nd Southwest employee then in a childishly theatrical manner went over to the scores of bags and started ""looking"" for my bags, slowly one by one, exactly in the area where they were not (remember, I had pointed them out already).  These words come to mind:  sheer ignorance and malice.I was handed my bags as though I, and my bags, were pieces of garbage to be gotten rid of.  Absolutely, Southwest!  I am glad to be thrown away from your airline after 10+ years of nearly bi-monthly flights.  And as I before would enthusiastically encourage people to fly Southwest -- because of the customer-friendly service -- I now equally enthusiastically tell them NOT to fly Southwest.As I pointed out to the professional and courteous customer service agent who took my lengthy complaint -- and she did apologize profusely for those DCA Southwest baggage employees' behavior, as well as for Southwest's delay with my bags -- there is no way those 4 employees could have acted with such arrogance and impunity were they not feeling protected by an equally egregious Southwest management at DCA.","{'neg': 0.063, 'neu': 0.868, 'pos': 0.069, 'compound': 0.8433}",0.8433

0.8445,2020-01-01,2020-01-01,50.0,Best customer experience ever on an airline,"Before flying down I spent the $50 for the two of us to get the advanced seating option.  When I got my boarding passes we were still almost the last to board - on both legs.  On leg two we could not even sit at the same end of the airplane.  The next day I emailed a complaint to SW.  They acknowledged my complaint in a return email the next day.  When it was tie to fly back I figured why bother?  The night before the return flight I received an email from SW telling me that they were refunding the $50 and apologized for the mix up.  That did impress me.   However, that is not what impressed me the most. The night before my wife went to bed early, feeling queasy.  In the AM she said she felt better but not 100% yet.  While waiting 4 hours to board we went to mid terminal to have a drink and a bite.  She ordered a martini.  As she was finishing it I suggested that she cut herself off as she was not herself.  She ordered another anyway.  A while after that arrived I left for 10 minutes to change clothes.  When I returned her drink, and glass, we're gone.  And so was she - mentally.  Never seen anything like that before.  I had to physically help her to gate 8.  There she sat trying to sleep.  Then we were notified we had to go to Gate 6.  I think she was worse at this time and it was a struggle to get her to the gate area.  When it was time to get in line I had to help her while we dragged 2 carry ons.  FINALLY made it in to the plane where the flight crew approached me about my wife and that we shouldn't make the flight to Baltimore.  I said we would thinking that she would be sober in 4.5 hours.  10 minutes before flight time they asked us off the plane.  Here is where it gets good. Outside the planes entrance was a flight attendant with a wheel chair, plus another staff to take our carry ons.  They walked all the way to the luggage area with us and retrieved our bags (now its 5 total) and then took us to see the SW medic.  He told me how to feed and water my wife for best results in handling too much alcohol.  Then the two flight attendants - both women - walked us thru customs and then to the waiting van that I called.  These women also had mad arrangements for us to catch the same flight the next day - all at no charge.  I don't think that we will ever fly another airline than SouthWest (unless they don't go where we need to go).  That was a class act.  FYI - I got Sheryle back to the apartment (I called the owner for OK) and she was in bed by 6:00pm.  She didn't get up until 19:00am the next morning - 16 straight hours asleep - and felt good enough to walk but still had the upset stomach and headache - and then added a runny nose.  That's not alcohol but I sure think it aggravated it! Wow.  Thank you SouthWest.","{'neg': 0.066, 'neu': 0.857, 'pos': 0.077, 'compound': 0.8445}",0.8445

Overall, I would say that SFO has great shopping and dining, is wonderfully decorated, is convenient to drive into and out of - and totally blows at making airplanes land and take off on time. In the past year, I have had a higher percentage of my flights into and out of SFO delayed than at any other airport. When I check FlightAware, in general the other two Bay Area airports will be on-time, while SFO will be delayed. I have been delayed due to fog, winds, air traffic, runway construction and smoke. The most heinous delay was when airport operations decided to ""flip the airport"" - switch which direction traffic would land and take off - which made every airplane on the ground, even ones lined up to take off, have to then taxi around to a different runway. This happened after they closed the boarding door on my flight and put us twenty-sixth in line for take-off and delayed us for over an hour. This was one of the only two times I've ever actually missed a connecting flight. Other than SFO's near-incompetence with their core function, the airport is largely okay. I fly American from Terminal 2, but I go through security at the Delta terminal, Terminal 1, because there are currently only 8 gates in operation there, and I can go through PreCheck in less than 5 minutes, then walk over to T2 inside security. The tram that runs to the rental car facility is rather slow, but does the job fairly stress-free. And, it's fun to look at the jumbo and super-jumbo jets (Airbus 380, that is) that fly internationally. But in general, I try to avoid SFO, especially for departures if I have to make a connection.","{'neg': 0.037, 'neu': 0.911, 'pos': 0.052, 'compound': 0.8446}",0.8446

The Miami ground staff for AA is bi-lingual, as is the cabin staff - for good reason with the heavy South America passenger component. The reality is that English speakers often cannot understand the PA announcements, even the English versions because of the heavy latin accents. If you don't live in Miami be prepared to struggle with understanding the instructions. Having said that, I don't find AA  to be as bad as many of the reviews, I'm sure there are bad flights and bad crews on all airlines, I sometimes think the criticisms are a bit overdone, and most of my half dozen annual flights on AA are good to very good. As far as the physical facilities, AA's Miami concourses are impressive works of architecture. For those who flew here back in the 60's & 70's it is a matter of night and day - it does sprawl and you need to learn to use the people mover if you are over 60, but it is quite a nice facility. My one exclusion would be their airport lounges, during peak times they are  grossly overcrowded - the main terminal is more serene than the lounges during those periods.

Wondering why they need partnering with Delta to lower their standards. Flight from London to Minneapolis ever rude cabin crew. Nobody at the doorway to welcome the passengers and direct them to their seats. Not one smile and really abrupt cabin crew members. the sole good thing was that they had an honest selection of entertainment a minimum of it kept our mind faraway from their rudeness. Food selection was average. Flight from Minneapolis - Las Vegas more friendly crew and drinks were offered regularly and adequately which made us really surprise for a flight compared to the other for the flight. On our way back at the airport in Las Vegas when checking in again not one smile from the bottom crew or any welcome. Flight from Las Vegas - Atlanta was fine and crew friendly and adequate snacks and drinks served. flight from Atlanta - London we were welcome this point at the doorway and were directed to our seat. An unpleasant surprise was expecting me as soon as I popped down the seat tray ahead of me to read. Yes, it had been messy with food stain and dry sauce thereon from the previous flight and has not been clean which put me off eating. I requested it to be cleaned which was done just about immediately but no apologies whatsoever from the cabin crew.

Apparently there is a protocol that no passengers are aloud up near the front bathrooms when a pilot is coming out of the cockpit. That’s completely understandable after 9/11. However, no announcement was made that that was happening, and at the same time I needed the restroom unbeknownst that the pilot just exited the cockpit. So as I approached the bathrooms, the female flight attendant abruptly puts up her hand and loudly says, “STOP! You can’t enter this area” Confused as to the reason (I’m thinking maybe I can’t use the one by first class), I decide to at least try and hand her my empty pop can and cup, so I can at least get rid of that. Again, with no explanation and DRAWN HAND IN THE AIR, she just says “Stop! Don’t enter here”. So after being treated like a criminal twice, I head to the back of the plane, use the bathroom, and return to my seat. After a while they come by with more drinks, and she sees I’m annoyed with her. She asks if I’m the one who came to the front. I affirm I was. She THEN explains why I couldn’t come up front. REALLY?!? Why couldn’t she have politely explained it while I’m standing in front of all the passengers up front at the time?? I would have completely complied and not be made to feel stupid. I understand protocol, but give passengers a heads up, or KINDLY explain as they approach at an inopportune time.

They cost a bit more, not as much as First Class, and give us the leg room he needs. We've had some wonderful conversations with the flight attendents when they sit for the end of the trip. Our theory is, we prefer AA because they fly where we want to go, the seats are no smaller than other airlines, and we know where we will be sitting not having to behave like cattle. We put a little more away these days for our trips to insure we get the extra leg room.

0.8632,2018-10-06,2018-10-06,3.0,"""a complete disaster"""," |  So I like American Airlines, they have new planes and treat their frequent flyers really well. I have been the highest status on United, Delta and American in the past five years and am currently highest on Delta and American. Needless to say I travel a lot. I will book about 250000 miles this year. Mostly domestic wth 10 international trips. I will go to 80 airports a year in average. Sadly Charlotte is the closest airport to my home and is the worst airport I travel through (yes, this includes JFK and CDG). The worst part is the staff are genuinely nice and really try hard but the airport operations are a complete disaster. I have gone through Charlotte 31 times this year and have averaged a 35 minute taxi time. I have missed 14 flights this year trying to go through Charlotte. I have driven home 11 times (I am 80 miles away). Yes, there is perpetual. construction but LaGuardia is much worse there. It is simply they dont know how to route planes on the ground. I am literally typing this as I am taxiing (45 minutes so far). I am baffled that LaGuardia and JFK figured out how to move aircraft in the ground but Charlotte cant. Maybe the air traffic team at Charlotte should benchmark any other airport in the world (I mean this literally) to understand how to move aircraft on the ground. This task is clearly beyond their comprehension. This is frankly confusing in the home of Nascar! It is a shame too because the services on the airport are actually pretty good.

"," |  Twice disappointed with the service at the transportation center. I understand that the staff may want to be friendly but they appear to be selectively friendly. I was trying to make a train; the person at the kiosk was having a leisurely chat and had no time to help me with my questions. He misinformed me, pointing me to the ticket machine and stating that I first had to purchase a ticked on the level where he was. Even after I had the ticket he still was talking and giving his opinions on some subject and did not stop talking to assist. The area was not crowded, but I had to figure things out myself. When I got down to the tracks there were ticket machines I could have bought a ticket. But by the time I had traipsed my luggage down the stairs (no mention or direction regarding an elevator) the train had departed. It being a Sunday afternoon I had to wait another hour. A week earlier, I had to wait for more than 5 minutes while the kiosk person spoke to another traveler about where he grew up and the schools he went to. Like I say, friendlyI get itbut isnt the job one of helping travelers get from one place to another?","{'neg': 0.054, 'neu': 0.843, 'pos': 0.102, 'compound': 0.8635}",0.8635
0.8636,2019-09-01,2019-09-01,40.0,Wish SW had better system for boarding,"Southwest has many great points:  You can check in two free bags and are allowed two carry-ons; they don't charge change or cancellation fees.  They have a decent schedule to Orlando offering 2 or 3 direct flights to Orlando.  (I always try to fly non-stop.).  You can also join their Rapid Rewards Shopping (earn points by ordering through their website) and Rewards for Opinions (completing online surveys).  Both of these allow you to accumulate points you can use to purchase tickets.  And, of course, you can earn frequent flier miles.What I've never liked is the way you board.  24 hours before your flight, you go to their website and they assign you a boarding number (not a seat reservation).  At the airport they board in 3 separate groups.  A group first, B second and C last.  Passengers line up according to their boarding pass number.  That's where the fun begins.  If the plane is packed, the line-up can be annoying.  Some people try to cheat by entering the line ahead of their number.  SW doesn't always catch these cheaters.   You can pay a $15-20 fee for an early-bird check in but that still doesn't get you a reserved seat, just a better position in the queue.  If you could reserve your seat at the time you make your reservation, I would rate SW a 5-star airline.","{'neg': 0.038, 'neu': 0.867, 'pos': 0.094, 'compound': 0.8636}",0.8636

0.8638,2019-07-30,2019-07-30,4.0,"""terminal to terminal is a hassle""","  |  I arrived at JFK from Manila on a Philippine Airlines flight in May 2019, used it for both arrival and departure on JetBlue in June 2019, and then used it for transit from a JetBlue flight to a Philippine Airlines flight in July 2019. Sure, you can get to this airport from seemingly anywhere around the world, and it services the exciting city of New York. The TSA agents typically are surprisingly decent too. And check-in staff are usually pretty nice. Unfortunately, that's pretty much the extent of the positives about this airport. Upon arrival in Terminal 1, I was greeted by a customs and immigration facility that appeared to be under construction. It looked awful - all torn up! A passport control officer was basically just waving all of us in the U.S. Citizens line through while wishing us a good one. It seemed to take a really long time for luggage to arrive on the carousel. I don't mean my luggage personally. I mean anyone's luggage! Meanwhile, staff informed my parents (who were picking me up there) that everyone from our flight had already exited customs - when none of us had yet! My first flight into JFK on JetBlue was delayed. My flight out of JFK on JetBlue was delayed. My flight back to JFK on JetBlue was delayed. I think the only reason my flight back to Manila on Philippine Airlines was NOT delayed was that it took off at 3:45 A.M., when no one else was flying out of the airport! Transiting from terminal to terminal is a hassle, too. It requires exiting your first terminal, walking down a seemingly endless hallway to the AirTrain, taking the AirTrain to your second terminal's stop, and then walking down another seemingly endless hallway to that terminal proper. Then, of course, because you're coming in from outside the secure area, you have to go through security all over again! As for food and beverage outlets, most appear to range from relatively expensive to borderline price gouging. One very notable exception was the Dunkin' Donuts landside in Terminal 1. It appears to be the only dining option available 24 hours, and so it was the only place I could use my $20 meal voucher landside, since my flight departed in the middle of the night. At Dunkin' Donuts, I was informed that if I was going to use my meal voucher, then I had to spend at least $20. I was astonished! I struggled to manage to buy $20 worth of food and drink there. I made myself sick. I still do not understand why they would not accept the voucher for a smaller amount. It's not like they would be losing money on the deal! Add to all of this restrooms which are often not very clean and with sensors which automatically turn on sink faucets when you're nowhere near them (but don't turn on when you are near them). Finally, there's the issue of the airport's being quite far from Manhattan. I've heard LaGuardia and Newark are even worse. If so, then heaven help the people who fly out of there!","{'neg': 0.068, 'neu': 0.851, 'pos': 0.081, 'compound': 0.8638}",0.8638

On Monday, December 30th, my wife and 10-year old daughter and I were heading home from a wonderful vacation in Tampa, Florida and looking forward to sitting together on a short direct flight.  As an ""A-List"" member, I had an ""A"" boarding pass.  My daughter had a ""B"" pass, and my wife had a ""C"" pass.  We approached the gate agent and asked to upgrade my daughter's pass and my wife's pass so we could all board earlier.  The gate agent told us that we only needed to upgrade my wife's pass, because when traveling with a 10-year old child, she could board with one of her parents.  We paid a $40 upgrade fee to get my wife an ""A"" pass and then the boarding process began.My wife and daughter walked up to get on the plane, and the operations agent told my wife that our daughter couldn't board with her. So my daughter walked back to me, my wife got on the plane and boarding continued.  When my daughter and I went to board, my daughter was held up by the operations agent like he was a rogue bouncer at a Las Vegas nightclub.  He would not let us on the plane, despite her age and my ""A"" pass.  So we waited until B and got on together.  As we approached him, now for the 3rd time, I questioned why the gate agent had told us we could board together and didn't need an upgrade for our daughter and why he treated our daughter this way.  He became agitated and asked ""should I just let everyone on when they want to get on?""  Eventually, to avoid a scene, I told him that I hope if he ever has a child that someone somewhere would treat his child the way he treated mine.  I also told him I'd be sharing my experience with the airlines and on Trip Advisor.The operations agent couldn't have been nastier - and mostly in the direction of my young daughter.

Its not actually run by southwest, they outsource it to different parties. Good luck if you have any issues with your accommodations.2. Do not trust the pictures or reviews on their website. Inaccurately represent the actual accommodations.3. Price and points might sound great, but being sleep deprived due to bad accommodations are NOT WORTH IT Southwest provide a great point deal to stay and what is advertised to be a 3 star hotel: The Capitol Hotel Downtown Nashville. The website deceivingly shows this as an actual hotel, not a motel. It has open hallways with windows facing the street that is extremely loud and unsafe. The walls are paper thin to the point I can hear the conversation in the room next to me. It has a police officers sitting lobby for security which is an immediate red flag.On top of this, I requested a king room for a romantic valentines getaway and they gave us doubles. I’m baffled that southwest would tie their name and promote this hotel with promotional points to encourage booking here.Our romantic weekend is ruined thanks to the complete misrepresentation of the hotel described. I had to book an alternative hotel and have to pay double what I could’ve had I known this would be such a terrible stay.

Recently, however, I've discovered that Southwest has moved to ""hyperdynamic pricing"". This is where they raise rates almost instantly on a flight in which you've shown interest (via a search on their site or an effort to modify an existing reservation). If you take a few minutes to think about a flight before purchasing, they'll increase the price on you...sometimes considerably. IMHO, this is a form of predatory pricing, designed to coerce the consumer to make a purchase immediately, and to extract an increase (and a high percentage one at that) if you don't.

The young flight attendant said OK so a few of began to move around.  I took an empty exit row behind me.  Suddenly a senior flight attendant (older male)  walked quickly up to me, demanding ""return to your original seat immediately"".  I began to explain that I was given permission to spread out, only to be interrupted at his even louder, ""People pay for the privilege to sit in these seats"".  Surprised at his nasty, impatient tone,  I slowly replied, ""I understand that.  However we are simply trying to spread out.""

Please remember that although staff are there everyday and know what the process is, its unlikely that passengers are so familiar. Im all in favour if enhanced security, but the area delegated is too small for the number of staff and passengers and this leads to passengers being parted from bags and separation of grey boxes so it becomes harder to keep up with whats happening which adds to the distress. A grown up at the airport would benefit from standing and watching the process to see what is actually happening as opposed to what they think is happening. After security the black sparkly path leads through the duty free, all quite unpleasant, loud and garish and so immediately after the security stress cannot be good for sales.

A recent flight from RDU to ATL, though, the gate agents were frazzled due to the aircraft being late incoming (due to mechanical problems). They did not keep people in the gate area updated with the most recent information, which led to panic and them having to rebook almost everyone in the gate area (most people were connecting in ATL, myself included). Thankfully, I used the phones in the help area instead of waiting to talk with the gate agents. The woman I spoke to was helpful and quick in rebooking me on a later flight (which the gate agents had told me previously that I would ""for sure"" make my connection...then later made another announcement that they were incorrect).

I was saving the miles for a different location but the amount of miles needed to redeem for that trip would have been so high for an 11 hour flight or I could have used less miles and taken 27 hours to get there instead of 11 hours.  Therefore, I booked that trip with frquent flyer miles from a competitor airline, using the minimum number of frequent flyer miles and minimum amount of travel time. Once my America Airlines frequent flyer miles are all redeemed, I do not plan on using American Airlines again. This trip was taken 2/29/20 to 3/3/20, prior to a severe coronavirus outbreak in the US. I was very bothered by the cleanliness of the aircraft. Initially when I sat in my seat, I noticed a used napkin in the seatback in front of me. I wondered how well the plane was cleaned inside, such as emptying seatback pockets, wiping down tray tables, armrests, seats, and headrests. This should always be done, especially when coronavirus was starting to affect the US.     The wifi and inflight entertainment was aweful. Since inflight movies were not accessible, Frozen II was shown in the cabin.  I wanted to access wifi, even if I had to purchase it. Wifi connection was unavailable. I didn't bring things to do on the plane since I thought I could select a movie to watch or use wifi. The unavailability of both made my flights seem very long. I am very used to 11 hour flights since I have flown to Hawaii from Newark, New Jersey 17 times. However, having inflight wifi, movies and entertainment can make an 11 hour flight not seem long at all. American's lack of functioning inflight wifi and entertainment made a short trip from Philadelphia to Dallas seem extremely long.

0.8884,2019-12-01,2019-12-01,10.0,14 Hours of Misery,"Flying to the US a couple of weeks earlier, I flew Delta’s Premium Select in which I was told is very roomy. It is not. There is more room on Korean Air’s economy flight. So for the return, I upgraded to Delta One. Little did I know this was the worst flight I would have ever taken. First, my seat would not recline even though the seats are supposed to lay flat. My TV stopped working an hour into the flight. I had no entertainment, nor did I have any concept of time since I couldn’t see where I was in flight. In Delta One, you can only turn on the light or call the flight attendant through the monitor. Well, since mine didn’t work I had to get up each time to find an attendant because they were never around. When I first told the flight attendant that my television did not work, her response to me was, “I am not a mechanic”. The meals were cold. I had to use my flashlight on my phone to see. The door to my seat got stuck where I had to jam it open. And the charger worked intermittently throughout the flight. And I was told it was a brand new plane. I had no rest and was tired and sleepy when I arrived in Seoul, yet I still had to conduct my meetings. My flight was worse than an economy ticket. One of the flight attendants offered me miles and I told them I want the money back because it was not a business class experience at all. I had originally paid $703 to upgrade to Premium select until I my first flight so I upgraded to Delta One for $1,532, which I paid over $2,000 for a first class 14 hour flight and received a less than comparable economy flight. After my flight I requested to be refunded for my upgrade through customer service online.  I was told they would refund my ticket upgrade yet the amount they quoted me of $724 was not what I paid for my upgrade. I told them that was not my upgrade amount. Then they wrote me back and said that was half of the amount for the upgrade, which apparently they cannot do simply division either. I received a second email saying I would not be satisfied and that they would no longer correspond on the matter. This is the way Delta dismisses customers. It didn’t matter that I was a first class customer or that I had Silver Medallion status, I was just another customer that suckered into their flight. Worst of all I had given them praise coming in, but they they didn’t care about having a new loyal customer and showed me the true way they treat customers. I fly first always, so I know what a first class experience should be - in country I had a short flight from Denver to Las Vegas on Frontier and that experience was 1,000 times better than my 14 hour Delta One experience. I would never fly nor recommend this airline. It is just like all the other American airlines - poor customer service, filled with arrogant employees.The airline clearly stated they would refund my upgrade amount, yet when I told them of the amount error they had too much pride to correct it and dismissed all because they could. This airline should never receive any awards with the way they treat their customers and with their raggedy planes.

At check-in, we were told that because we were early we wouldn’t have any problem getting a bulkhead seat which mtsweet needed (the extra legroom).  We we the only ones at the gate, a good three hours before the flight, and when the gate agent arrived (about half an hour before board time), she acknowledged our being there and our need, so we felt secure.  All things changed when a young Southwest employee (male), showed up and at boarding let it be known that all those who could walk with Pre-boarding on their thicket could board, but only those who could walk, no one who needed assistance (wheelchairs included).  My sweetie was beside herself - why have pre-boarding for those who could walk, and not for wheelchair dependent.  Incensed, my sweet argued briefly with that young man who said there was no first come first served at Southwest, despite their early bird program, as well as pre-board program.  This gate person was belligerent, and not at all caring.  The upshot being that my Sweet struggled to get out of the wheelchair and declared she was “walking,” despite her boot and unsteadiness, leaving me behind to do whatever I could with her chair and that gate person.  It seems that this gate person, and maybe Southwest have no regard for those who need assistance onto the plane, as well as access to seats with room (at the front of the plane - walkers with Pre-board would likely take those prime seats, those depriving those who need them to the cramped seating more aft on the plane.  We have always observed those in wheelchairs being the first to be boarded, but we were deprived of our one time need.  I hope this was a one time occurrence because this young man did not like older people with Pre-boarding needs approved by his own employer.  Southwest has always been a favorite of ours, but this is causing us to re-think our position.  My Sweetie managed to hobble her way to a bulkhead aisle, and our flight was uneventful afterwards, with the wheelchair being delivered to the jetway with I’m minutes after our arrival in Phoenix.","{'neg': 0.088, 'neu': 0.811, 'pos': 0.101, 'compound': 0.8888}",0.8888

For my most recent trip, I paid extra to be automatically checked in and got a good place in line for boarding.

First we have to go through the security check in Helsinki and get rid of all our drinks, buy water, drinks and even a bottle of liquor at Helsinki. Arriving after a 2.5hr flight at Heathrow, with 90 minutes to change flights. First you need to go through exact the same security check as in Helsinki. Security staff yelling and threatening people to listen to them or else they will be delayed. Here you are as a parent trying to get your family to another plane for a nice and stress free vacation. Unfortunately I forgot to take 2 iPads out of my bag. A simple mistake. The security staff took my bag (and several other bags of criminals, including an old English lady who clearly had difficulties understanding the instructions) to put it aside for at least 15 minutes before eving looking at it. The bag and iPads now needed some special investigation and it took another 15 minutes before I had my bag back. While I was waiting I could see several other people in the same situation, staff not trying at all to help the travelers, staff yelling and cursing at people for not putting the trays at the correct place. We had to run from the security check to the gate, me carrying a crying 3 year old, and a 7 year old trying to keep up. What a relief to make it to the gate and meet the incredible nice and friendly staff of British Airways. I feel bad for them, but I will never fly again via Heathrow.

However, despite the glossy flyer telling you of all of these potential selections, they were running out of entree options fairly quickly into the dinner service, and were down to only one by the time they got to us (less than half way into economy).  Also, basically all of the items offered for the dinner service contained dairy in one way or another, which I'm trying to reduce.  Next time, I might try to request a special dietary meal instead of hoping there might be lower-dairy options available, like the Thai Chicken Salad that ran out first.One other minor annoyance: when arriving at the airport, Delta kept listing the flight as On Time, even though sites like FlightAware kept showing us as delayed 45 to 60 minutes, starting as early as 4 hours before scheduled departure.  Delta waited until the scheduled boarding time to finally, officially acknowledge that those sites were correct, and we were delayed by the same amount.  If Delta filed an amended flight plan with the delayed takeoff, I don't think they should continue to communicate boarding/takeoff times to the passengers that can no longer legally happen.  Be open and honest with us.To be clear: I actually prefer Delta over most other carriers for flights to Europe from PDX, especially in comparison to my previous experiences on United and Aer Lingus.

I connect semi-regularly through DFW - makes sense, as it's American's headquarters and largest hub. I'll say right here that I love connecting through DFW. It is one of the easiest airports for connections that I've ever experienced. The concourses are wide and open, seldom choked by clusters of boarding passengers. The physical layout of the concourses minimizes the need for airplanes to wait on the tarmac ""for traffic to clear the alley,"" as happens at other airports like O'Hare. Best of all, the SkyTrain at DFW absolutely flies, and can connect you from one corner of the airport to the farthest other corner in about 9 minutes. I'll accept a tighter connect at DFW than I will almost anywhere else, because of that SkyTrain. Dining at DFW is varied and generally good. B Terminal is a little skimpy, but otherwise I have no complaints. Restrooms are generally large enough for the number of travelers, and generally clean. I've had loo-oong layovers, and have walked the entirety of all terminals at DFW...and can report that they are basically all consistently good and competent. The biggest detractor I can find is that there's no airport WiFi. At least, I haven't ever found one to sign into. I agree with a previous reviewer that a lot of the hateful reviews must come from passengers who are generally unaware of the requirements of modern air travel (which is okay; not everyone flies weekly like I do) but don't want to admit when they've made a mistake.

The first time, we showed up in plenty of time.  We checked in on line so all we had to do was drop bags to check.  We dutifully went to the bag drop kiosk, punched in information, and got luggage claim tickets.  Next stop, we need to drop off the bags.  Guess what?  There was no way to do that!  We were told to get in the long long non-moving line that handled everything—-booking, check in etc.  That made no sense, and I told they employee so, and he suggested that curbside might be faster.  We went out there and after a long wait, were able to drop off our bags.  We lamented our story to the curbside guy, and he just shrugged and said Delta didn’t staff the desks inside.So, three weeks later, same thing.  We go straight to the curbside though, and they we’re pulled out of that line (it was barely moving) and told to go inside, with others.  We did that, but shouldn’t have.  Word passed around that Delta didn’t staff the desks until 8AM, so there was a HUGE jam at that time.  We waited and waited.  Finally, we were told that, even though we arrived for our flight 2 hours before boarding, there was no way we would make our flight.  We had to go to special services and then wait again.  They rebooked our flight with two stops rather than the nonstop we had originally booked.  Just a vapid, “we’re sorry” was given. Lessons:  1.  Don’t Fly Delta out of Boston if you have checked bags.2.  If you can’t follow #1, just break line and go straight to the counter, first class, whatever.  If Delta doesn’t respect you, why should you have to respect their “lines”.   Anarchy is better than futility.3.  Look at social media for all of the video and rants going on today, Sat Dec 21, re Delta in Boston if you think I’m overstating things.","{'neg': 0.057, 'neu': 0.876, 'pos': 0.067, 'compound': 0.8976}",0.8976

Crew members were friendly, I would have given Southwest Airlines a 5 star ratings, but, something has got to be done about people saving seats.  On the way to Mexico, there was an Airline attendant, that told a passenger to move over and let a person looking for a seat sit down.  I wished she was on every Southwest Airlines flight that I travel.  I like to ride in the middle seat, but, there is always someone saving 2 seats by putting their bags in the middle and aisle seat for someone in the bathroom(?!!??). I get motion sickness, and, I have found that sitting in the front of the plane eases my symptoms.  People will lie to your face and become very confrontational if you ask them to move their stuff. Southwest is open seating.  This is a plea for Southwest Airlines to announce over and over that saving seats are not allowed.  If you are on the plane before their Mom or husband, then, you should be able to sit in the first available seat.  I know that Southwest Airlines is aware of this problem, but, choose to look the other way on most flights and let the passengers deal with this mess. The best solution is allow passengers to select seats when tickets are purchased. With the problem of saving seats, selecting seats at the time of purchase would eliminate this issue and cause for a pleasant flight for all. Southwest Airlines please consider allowing passengers to select their seats upon purchase.

Air traffic control had us circle for 20 minutes. Ok, that happens. 2. Once we landed we were stuck on the tarmac for 40 minutes due to another plane not having docked correctly? and lack of communication regarding which gates the preceding planes were to be at. This doesnt really happen much, so it was frustrating. 3. We had to go through two different rounds of security screening before having to pick up our checked bags. At the first one, even though were had the mobile passport completed, there was no line for mobile passport and with 6 kiosks only 2 were open; one exclusively for crew and global entry with the other for everyone else. 4. We had to then collect our luggage, which took another 30 minutes, to be randomly selected to have them rummage through our things. 5. Once they unfolded everything and left it a mess we were dismissed and sent towards the exit. We then had to recheck our bags at the airline desk which was on a different level and a long way away. Luckily, an airline staff member allowed us to skip the line and simply drop the bags. This was the one person who was helpful; airline staff. 6. Next we had to go through airport security again, however, this time it was the same security you go through if you were just arriving to the airport. Keep in mind we had just gotten off of an airplane here at the airport. Once in the line we got to hurry up and wait while 6 TSA employees condescendingly yelled at everyone. Nothing helpful from them, just threats to slow the line if their power-trip-orders werent obeyed. If someone failed to zip up their backpack before sending it through the scanner, instead of asking them to zip it, the person was chastised in front of the crowd. 7. The line of travelers constantly growing while the Walmart approach (having many registers with only one open) was adopted by the TSA staff. One screening conveyor belt was in use while 3 others were closed. With the exception of the lady who was running the conveyor belt, who would not make eye contact with anyone even when asked why my sealed clear bag from the duty free store back in a London was set aside. Nope, my duty free items needed to be taken out and run through another scanner. 8. What was the rest of the TSA staff doing? Literally walking around in circles not know who was supposed to do what. I heard hey, who is on this one? And I though so and so was supposed to be here still along with other statements that really reassured me our safety was the priority and was being handled by professionals. 9. We were reassured that once through this last security check that the gate was literally just up another escalator. Nope. Next we had to jump on yet another shuttle. 10. Whats the best part of this whole experience. The arrival gate (e24) was in the same terminal as the departure gate (e31). All of that fuss was to go through customs. In short, this is the worst airport in the modern world to deal with and I will gladly pay more to fly through another airport in the future so that I can avoid this from happening again.","{'neg': 0.057, 'neu': 0.867, 'pos': 0.076, 'compound': 0.8979}",0.8979

","  | I was unfortunate enough to have to attend a meeting in Atlanta, unfortunate not because of Atlanta but because I had to pass through this airport. The layout is just crazy with incredibly long terminals so be sure to where your walking shoes. TSA is a nightmare as all passengers for all airlines pass through a central checkpoint which is so incredibly slow, the slowest service I have ever encountered (including Orlando which at least spilts to two terminal wings) and Ive been through a number of airports. Even the TSA Pre line had about a half hour plus wait. The airport itself looks old although clean and seems to lack some of the new tech like charging stations for devices that you would expect to find in this day and age. I flew JetBlue out of JFK for this trip and what a difference between JetBlues own terminal 5 and this hole in the wall. If you can avoid passing through this airport I highly recommend it as many of the people dont really seem to care about the travelers passing through and if you have a connecting flight thats either at a distant gate or concourse you may miss your flight as they are so far away. There are no terminal shuttle carts like you would find in other big airports like Dallas or Raleigh Durham.","{'neg': 0.072, 'neu': 0.819, 'pos': 0.109, 'compound': 0.899}",0.899

Well, actually you guys did!  First, you canceled my flight due to the Hurricane.  Then after several agents and four hours, I got switched into flying into Tampa out of Midway.

So what seems to be the problem?  Well, we don't have your reservation!  Um~ what?  Now,  I'm getting mad.  As a former travel agent, I know how things work and it wasn't supposed to be like this.  I'm with 4 other people, I have to catch my flight and now I don't have a spot you have to be kidding me.  I call one of my other friends over because she was having the same issue and she said they had to call a supervisor.

That said, SFO is a terrible airport, and if we had a better choice we'd take it instead. Firstly the international terminal is leagues behind its counterparts in most any other city. And as we specifically travel to western Europe and the UK SFO does not compare to any of them overall. Coming back home the differences are so glaring; it's like night and day. SFO's international terminal is so tiny, post security dining is extremely poor. Not to mention expensive. They don't even have a well-stocked newsstand. Worse, however, is the TSA and immigration staff. TSA staff members can be pretty rude and abrasive especially to foreigners I'm sure. We're used to the attitude, but it makes a bad impression. Immigration is either hit or miss mostly the latter. And don't even ask about customs officials. They profile certain races which is not only archaic but unfair. How many times the immigration officials allowed us clearance only to be abruptly stopped near the exits by some Oriental customs official who thinks that because we look like them that we are lying about what we listed on our customs declaration form. We always note down everything we are bringing back & we are always within the monetary limits as well as we do not bring back contraband items. Yet these agents think they are so smart to do this profiling whilst the true perpetrators have been allowed to go. It's time to do away with this third world mentality and if they want to search then they need to do it to everyone and not just the ones they want to profile. So for everything I wish there were a way to rate SFO with minus points.

We've had passengers actually say that we couldn't sit in the seats that we chose when boarding the plane and that they were saving them for somebody which is not allowed, but nothing is said to them.  In other words, one person in their group pays for priority boarding and then they save seats for the rest of their group, when all of our members pay for it and are told we're not allowed to sit in certain seats... just unfair.

First, the American employees at DCA airport unprofessional, rude, and not knowledgeable.

A staff member literally walked away in the middle of “helping me” trying to get on standby for a flight stating to his coworker “what’s the point, the flight is full and there’s already 5 people on standby in front of her” and stormed off with not a word said to me. I could go on for hours about the incredibly rude American Airlines staff at the DC airport. 2nd, due to our canceled flight and the weather, AA was not able to get us a flight to our destination but instead was only able to get us on a flight to an airport 120 miles way from our original airport destination, causing us the need to rent a car for $200 and drive 2 hours. For myself and my fiancé both being loyal AA flyers, AA advantage members, and AA barclay credit card holders, you would think at the very least AA would comp us the cost of the rental car for not getting us to our destination. Instead I was met with “no it’s not our fault.” Then, our original flight we were 1st class &our flight we got changed to we were coach. Again, no compensation. To top it all off, they lost my fiancé’s checked luggage. Again, I am well aware the airline does not control the weather but I expected so much more from them and they dropped the balm every step of the way.

One of the see-thru boxes had been opened, the plastic seal removed along with two pieces of candy. Are you kidding me! Because the candy was in see-thru plastic containers it was totally unnecessary to open the box and remove the plastic seal. Crazy. Also, I had a bottle of liqueur padded with plastic on two sides and taped in place so the inspectors could clearly see the labels on the front/back of the bottle and see exactly what it was. They removed all the padding and didnt bother to tape it back on after inspecting it. Its a miracle it didnt break and spill all over the contents of my suitcase.

Check in was a breeze. Actually, since Southwest accounts for 70% of the flights at BWI, if you are on another airline it is usually easy. We were flying British Airways. After check in we had a nice meal at Passports Bar and Grill which was right next to our gate. Finished our meal, got on the plane and flew! Easy! Then there was the return. Not as good. First, we stood in line to check in at the kiosks. Then we stood in line to go through customs. The flight had 200+ people on board and there were two agents to process us. It seemed like a long time. Then finally when we got our bags there was yet a third line to get outside. I honestly have no idea what that last line was for. I thought they were going to check our bags and bag receipts to make sure we had the right luggage, but when we finally got to the front of the line we were just waived through.

Fortunately, I was returning home the next day and went straight to the lost and found to check on it. Thank goodness it was still there.

As I have put in a complaint on line-per their directions- and they are first now looking into reviewing it. So its difficult and will probably need an update later in hopes that they just don't say oh my we are so sorry that you had this experience.  Husband can not stand or walk for long time. As it was he became ill in Florida at a visit. Cleared to go home we went to the airport in the afternoon. They got their wheelchair and took us to gate. Seems he was the chosen one to get the full treatment of security check. Now, this I understand and I get it. Its their job in efforts to keep us safe. They had him stand and go thru the body scan. Ok. Then they kept him standing. When he was dizzy and went to reach to hold on they would not allow him to. They would not allow him to sit while they checked him and spread and scanned something on his hands. They ignored me when I stated more than once that the man needs to sit. As this part all could have been done while sitting. Seems the woman before him had a foot boot. They made her take it off. She sat in the one wheelchair there designated for him. They had to ask her to get up after he was done so he could finally sit. I was  upset, frustrated and concerned and glad he did not fall or pass out causing further problems. As for the plane trip, other than a cold dousting of water spilled from a really sincerely lovely stewardess, opps, no problem accidents do happen, and shared smiles, I did note to a steward that the seats had small space and asked if my husband if there were any others available for his comfort. The curt reply- no this is a full flight, have him sit and keep his legs down. The flight was super fast and the pilots did a fine job of getting us back in record time though we did have to sit on the plane until the tarp opened a space. Overall in that area though the Delta flight was fine. The PAX people really could be more assisting and communicative. Thankfully a lady sitting at the turn style for the luggage told me where to find a chair I had checked as it was not to be seen anywhere along with where an elevator was. Not the smoothest experience this time. My friend mentioned something about getting precheck. I will look in to it. At least, like JETBlue, they did not insist on checking a bag that had my husbands meds in it that he had needed to take... As I noted above, I was really glad my husband did not fall or pass out.

I'm going to list problems with some no-cost or low-cost solutions. 1) Concourses are narrow, so pedestrian traffic is a mess. People are constantly bumping, almost bumping, crossing in front of, and getting behind slow people. Last night, a member of the cleaning crew had parked a rolling garbage bin in the middle of the concourse (E) and was off to the side having a casual conversation with a vendor. This caused many pedestrian issues, in an already stressful environment. Solution: train cleaning crews about traffic in the concourses and how to treat customers better and NOT block their paths. 2) Continual gate change for arrivals, and - what seems like - confusion for the airplane waiting to pull into the appropriate gate. I don't know how much larger airports are so organized, but CLT needs to have systems in place for parking planes quickly at their gates to get people to their connecting flights on time. Last night in Concourse E Gate 17 (6/13/2019), 5 breathless passengers showed up to catch the last flight to Columbia SC that day. The unconcerned gate employee told them the doors were closed, and there was nothing he could do. Their incoming flight had been blocked from their gate for a time, making them late to the Columbia flight and that flight pulled away without them. super simple, cheap solution: have a gate ready for each arriving plane. If a plane has passengers for connections, communicate with their connecting plane's crew to please wait 3-5 minutes for the passengers to arrive. 3) Some of the slide-walks weren't working, and you need that extra boost in speed to reach long distances between connections (see above). Solutions: maintain existing equipment and keep it running. 4) Lots of trash, lots of people working who seemed to not want to be there, and boarding queues crowding the already narrow corridors - there needs to be some management improvement at this airport.

It is a single aisle plane with 2-2 seating in business class.  When configured for an international flight, the seats are relatively narrow but they do lie completely flat.  Toe space is tight, but the seats were reasonably comfortable for a thin passenger to sleep.  However, the passenger in the aisle seat will have no privacy or separation from the aisle, and climbing over the aisle passenger is very difficult.  In flight entertainment is limited to tablets which when mounted on the seat back seem to be facing your seatmate or people in the aisle rather than at you.  Storage is very limited, although there is a space peculiarly located behind your shoulder.The breakfast was very good.  In Lima, we were given access to a non-American lounge which was excellent.The Lima/Miami based cabin crew were the most indifferent and unhelpful that I've ever experienced in business class.  It wasn't until the end of the flight that a member of the crew offered any warmth.  An hour into the flight, the captain put on the seat belt sign for turbulence.  Even though the vast majority of the flight was smooth, the seat belt light remained on for the remainder of the flight.  The forward lavatory for business class passengers is near the kitchen, under the watchful eye of the flight attendants who demanded that I return to my seat when I violated the seat belt light during a period of prolonged calmness.  As a result, this was the most uncomfortable business class flight I've ever experienced.  I'm mindful of the need to maintain hydration during long flights but never dared to open the bottle of water that I had been given, let alone accept anything to drink during the second beverage service.In Miami, the first bag was delivered 45 minutes after landing.  In light of this, I'd recommend at least 2.5 hours to make an international connection in Miami if arriving on an American flight.American Airlines can do well in business class.

Eventually someone came to get passengers with connecting flights but no explanation. We carried on waiting, the children were tired and thirsty and the corridor was hot. We finally got told that 5 large flights had arrived all at once. I assume this was the schedule and therefore was expected so why could they not either: advise people before they left the plane to be prepared for a wait or have more staff or organise some refreshment in the corridor or even better just advise people of the situation. What was worse was that upon getting the end of the corridor, there was a huge long snaking queue in the customs hall. It took us 3 hours to clear Orlando airport and then we had a 2 hour drive. Never again. I will find another route into South West Florida. Even the Virgin staff looked sympathetic and incredulous at our plight!","{'neg': 0.064, 'neu': 0.811, 'pos': 0.126, 'compound': 0.9183}",0.9183

For dessert selected the cheese course, the well intentioned crew member doubled up think she was doing me a favour, as I’d eaten virtually nothing at this stage. As you can see from the picture this was not exactly appealing in either presentation or taste. Cheese should have been allowed to breathe and acclimatise instead it was served straight from the chiller rock hard and the underripe. Coffee no options, no cappuccino or espresso just a huge mug of filter.

It is , hands down, the worst carry out there .   It is a ""low cost carrier"" that charges the same rate, often more than other airlines and then provides subpar service and ridiculous routes .  The ground and flight staff are snarky , uninformed and could care less about providing customer service .   My most recent experience, flying from PDX to RNO is the final straw for me.   My flight was cancelled sometime on 12/31 .  I was not informed until I reached the airport early 1/1 .   I was then only given two options both of which required an hour more of airtime and a 4.5 hour layover in Phoenix.   I went from an A 21 boarding pass to C22 for both legs of the flight.   The ground agent claimed the flight was cancelled the night before due to weather in Las Vegas .   I wasn't notified because legally they can contact me via text after a certain hour ( sounds far fetched ).  Had I been notified when they cancelled the flight the night before I could have cancelled by reservation had I and flown with Alaska Air ( superior airline by far) .  Instead I got to spend 8 hours traveling from PDX to RNO ( a 1.5 hour direct flight) .I spoke to another agent at the gate about the cancellation and she claimed it was mechanical reason ( SW favorite go to excuse for delays) .    So which is it?  My guess... Southwest's objective is always to reroute customers to meet their needs and bottomline and then pass the expense and inconvenience on to their customers rather than doing their best to honor flights and ease the inconvenience of their paying customers.  Just to top off my experience.. one agent qualified her excuses  to me with the statement that ""after all SW is low cost carrier"" as if that is a good reason to totally inconvenience passengers.   News flash to SW.. You are no longer less expensive than other short route carriers and you have lost my loyalty.    SW is coasting on a reputation from when they had inexpensive flights, more direct flights and an energetic, competent staff.   They no longer shine in any category and people will eventually catch on.Here is to 2020 free from any SW flights and headaches .","{'neg': 0.092, 'neu': 0.799, 'pos': 0.109, 'compound': 0.9218}",0.9218

What I have learned is not to pay for auto check in but to simply get in the need extra time line. The next time I have a connecting flight I will take advantage of the system and board early also. Perhaps anyone who needs extra time should have to wait to exit the plane  after everyone else. That may solve the problem.

Had excellent service from Aruba to Charlotte, the flight attendant, Leslie, was extremely helpful and provided a pleasant experience.  When we landed in Charlotte we had a four-hour layover before our next flight, however, we noticed that there was an earlier flight departing in two hours, thus saving us two hours of waiting.  We inquired with AA customer service desk knowing that we had full price tickets and thought we might be able to switch flights.  The Charlotte CSR was quite friendly and said she would try to switch our luggage to the earlier flight, noting that we could NOT fly without our checked luggage.  After several key strokes on her computer, we were told we were out of luck.  Hopefully, she really did try!  We were fine, no complaints, knowing that it’s a TSA rule about the luggage and we had planned to hunker down for the long delay anyways.However, the real disappointment occurred when we reached Richmond.  First, we waited 45 minutes at Midnight for our luggage to start arriving on the carousel, which made no sense whatsoever; since we were the only plane at the time (Miami arrived later).  We quickly secured one bag, but my spouse's bag had not arrived.  We spent another 10 minutes waiting and were directed to another carousel where more bags arrived, but not ours.  My spouse went into the AA office to report the missing bag and low and behold, there was his bag!  It had flown solo on the earlier flight we tried to get on.  So, AA will let the luggage fly w/o the passenger, but not the passenger w/o the luggage.  Really?","{'neg': 0.072, 'neu': 0.821, 'pos': 0.107, 'compound': 0.9248}",0.9248

One kid was constantly crying and two of the others were bickering back and forth and the mother was starting to loose her cool.

It's an utter disgrace to put people through that type of wait time after traveling. There were two agents for that huge line. Even having four agents would have made a huge difference. 8 agents would have cut the wait down to just over what I had, which was plenty. After missing our flight, we spoke to a few different help desks. They were all lovely and helpful, but rather low on correct knowledge. One sent us to a travel agency pretty far away to book a new flight, and when we made it there, there was no staff. They also told us we could go to airline counters to book flights which was incorrect. The best advice the one guy gave me was to not book with cheap airlines because they provide bad/low customer service when things go awry! If you're going to fly through here be prepared for possible long customs waits, and read the info on your airlines website (for instance, that the check in desk closes an hour before the flight even though the gate is 10 minutes away!).

Service was okay with nothing to write home about (response time to call button was significantly delayed). As for the food, I ordered Bibimbap so I can compare it with Asiana and their version was adjusted for the western palate (in a good way) although Asiana’s Bibimbap tasted better.  The bathroom surprisingly had no toiletries...other airlines usually stock their bathrooms with toothbrush, toothpaste, mouthwash, etc but Delta didn’t.

Toronto Pearson does not do this. Instead of needing to show my passport once or at most twice as in modern airports, I had to show my passport a total of eight times within one fifty minute period, in one instance to get into a room and another to get our of the same room. The personnel are petty an officious but that is only to be expected. Standing on line is never fun but it is tolerable if you think that you will be treated equitably. Instead, lines were created, opened and closed for no reason, allowing those who had not waited to be routed ahead of those who had. I was told they were ""special."" That is surprising because some were members of my own party. The USA has transplanted customs to be done at Toronto instead of at people's destination (in this case ATL). That part worked well but came as a surprise since it conservatively added thirty minutes to a 90 minute layover. Probably the worse part was the ground operation for Delta, my connection. We arrived barely in time to get in line only to discover after having stood in line for long minutes, that we had to have our passports ""verified"" (that sterile corridor thing again). That took another ten minutes of standing in a long and slowly moving line to rectify. Al in all we got on as the door was closing and were treated to a steward whose primary interest was getting off on time. he was ""shoveling manure"" not dealing with humans.

Several people including SWA staff helped out with my car seat, stroller, bags and my baby.

The flight attendant in the rear of the plane gave me two plastic bags; one for his dirty clothes and the other for his dirty diaper. Then I needed to use the restroom...UGH!

My wife and I had planned a much needed vacation to the South Pacific months in advance, with a once a week departure out of Los Angeles on Air New Zealand. We used Southwest to get us from Salt Lake City to LAX-namely because they had the best fares and there were no baggage fees. We’ve flown SWA many times before domestically, although they aren’t exclusively the airline we have chosen. That may change after our excellent experience with SWA.The day we left to the airport in SLC was chaotic and we rushed to get out the door. In the panic, my wife had left her insulin pump at home! We did not discover this until moments before the plane departed the gate (we were already seated).We had no choice but to get off the plane and figure something out.  The departing flight from LAX was leaving in six hours. Honestly, I thought the vacation was going to be canceled as our travel insurance was not going to cover the costs of re-routing us through New Zealand to the Cook Islands. SWA immediately stepped into action and the customer representative began making plans (and contingency plans) on how to get both of us to LAX in a timely fashion. I wish I had written her name down. She was extremely sympathetic when we explained the situation and within 30 minutes I was on my way. My wife (who had to wait to have her insulin pump delivered to the airport) was on her way within an hour and  a half. We both met up in Los Angeles with time to spare.I can’t say enough good things about the way the customer rep handled the situation. What could have been a devastating episode that could have ruined our plans for a dream vacation ended up being an afterthought because everything went so smoothly!

0.9348,2020-02-01,2020-02-01,30.0,Understandable Delay But Could Have Been Handled Better,"The experience started out fine with a smooth boarding. Thought we were ready to go until we were told that we had a weight and balance issue and needed 7 ""volunteers"" to take a later flight. With the strong winds out of the west, we needed to lose some weight so that we'd make it to Dallas and not bust minimums on fuel. I'm a pilot and I totally understand. But right after the statement about needing 7, they changed it to 10. Really gave the impression that they didn't know what they were doing. They offered $700 vouchers and only had two people take them up on it. I think a big part of the issue is that they couldn't tell people whether their flight would be later that day or the next day. That really makes a difference. The lady next to me told the gate agent that she needed to be to Dallas by 5:30 and asked if she could find out when a flight she could get on would arrive and the agent told her that she couldn't provide that information at that time. Again, they should have had their act together better. They also didn't specify until a later announcement that if you did spend the night that they would cover food, lodging and ground transportation. I know that's obvious to some people but not everyone and, frankly, with the way the airlines work these days, I'm not sure I'd have taken that for granted...Right after the first two volunteers left the plane, they upped the offer to $1200. Six more folks took them up on it so I thought we were waiting for two more but they closed the doors and we were backing away from the terminal. Yay! Then the plane stopped. After waiting a few minutes, the pilot came on and told us we had to go back and get two more off. I'm not sure why we left in the first place when we hadn't hit the ten we were told. So back we go. One couple had asked previously about getting to Austin and had been told, like the lady next to me, that they couldn't be told at that time when they'd get on another flight. But nobody else was volunteering so they gate agent worked with them and found them a flight with open seats that met their needs and they got off. So they closed the doors again...and we sat... Seems the gate agent couldn't get the jet bridge to move away from the plane. However, after a few minutes someone figured out something and off we went. The rest of the flight was smooth but long (Those westerly winds were really strong.) and we were about an hour late getting to DFW. So, as I said, I understand the problem but it could have been handled a lot more smoothly, with better communication and it would have resulted in a shorter delay and less frustration with the passengers. If American Airlines wants to be ""Something Special in the Air"" in a positive context, they have more work to do.","{'neg': 0.036, 'neu': 0.902, 'pos': 0.062, 'compound': 0.9348}",0.9348

A, B, or C. Lets say you get A20 that means you may go in early perhaps 19 people before you. Thats what you think!!! No, first the wheel chair patrons and partners go in, we usually count about 20 to 30 wheel chairs at Islip, That is approx.40-60 passengers before you.All of these people go on with wheel chairs, but many walk off (a miracle flight) on their own. If this is not enough another group goes on before you, those who need extra time (whatever that means)Now you can board the plane, You were first on line but about 70 people went before you, so you may get a seat past the wing.What if you have B or C?? Good luck hunting for seats together for a family, you may have to seperate and sit where you can. I hate this system, but the reps. at southwest tell me most people love it.

With assigned seats, you know where you are sitting. it would reduce wheelchairs for those who do not need them.

There is a little back-story so please read it all...Having booked my November flight back in July I booked a direct flight from ABQ to KC and then had to do a ""one stop - change planes"" to get back home. No biggie, have had to do that before. In late August I received an email declaring my itinerary had been changed and that my new return flight was going to have ""two stops - no plane change"" and that my total time in the air would be a little over 9 hours. They told me that I could attempt to make a change within about 36 hours or so but the timing was such that I didn't have time to sit on the phone and wait for the next available customer service rep to help me make the change. On my departure date I was in the ABQ airport awaiting my flight to KC, with time to kill I wanted to double check that my early-bird carried over to the new itinerary they sent me in August. While they were checking on that, Nezbah, Sheila and Steven (it was a team effort) were curious as to why I chose a flight that had two stops. I told them the story above and Nezbah told me to hang on a moment and began tapping some things on the keyboard. After a few minutes she found a direct flight from KC to ABQ, it left later in the day than my original and amended flights but I would arrive home a full 5 hours earlier than I would have if I would have kept the same flight.

0.937,2018-04-04,2018-04-04,1.0,"""a total disaster in terms of customer service""","  | I have been traveling through this airport since the early 1980's. The airport was clearly well designed from the start with a central hub supporting multiple airsides via automated trams. The system worked and worked well for many years. After 911, the main long term parking terminal was closed and a remote long term parking garage was built away from the main terminal. It wasn't a great solution, but the shuttle buses ran quickly and delivered you right to the correct airside. Later, the original long term parking area was reopened with increased pricing. The new remote site was renamed ""economy parking"", though at $10 per day it was hardly economy. But that price was better than the $18 per day of the reopened long term garage. So, for many years I would park in the economy garage then ride the shuttle to the main terminal. From there I would check-in at curbside and take the tram over to my airside. Recently the airport has undergone major revisions which include a monorail system that joins the economy garage to the main terminal. Also, a new centralized car rental facility has been built which is next to the economy garage and also served by the monorail. The result is a total disaster in terms of customer service. I don't know who designed this mess, but I can tell they have no idea how to move people through an airport facility. First you must find parking in the economy garage, which isn't easy because the space inventory system is now broken. There used to be signs that would tell you how many spaces were on each floor. Apparently the new construction broke that system, so good luck finding a space. Next you have to take the elevator down to the first floor, even though the monorail is located on the 4th floor. Then, you drag your luggage to the middle of the garage road and jump on the moving floor system. Yes, they mounted the moving floor in the middle of the garage's shuttle roadway. Not on the sidewalk (where they have plenty of room), but right in the lowest part of the garage where surely the Florida rains will short circuit the machinery. The moving floor thing will slowly take you to the opposite side of the garage where a new elevator systems has been installed. Where next? No problem in deciding, there are only 2 floors to select. So now you go back up to the 4th floor to wait for the monorail. And wait, and wait. There appear to be only two trains and one was broken. Once on the train, prepare for a wild ride. First the train drops 4 floors and accelerates as it follows the access road to the main terminal. People and luggage fly about as the train dips and weaves at high speed. I'm sure injuries have already occurred due to this new system. As it approaches the main terminal, the train climbs quickly and stops abruptly at the station. If you've survived this far, you must now drag your luggage to the escalator for a trip down 3 floors. Now good luck finding your airline counter. If you're flying Southwest then you're in luck, it's the first one you find. Other airlines are scattered around and the signage isn't so good. Prepare for a lot of wandering around. Once you check-in, you now ride another escalator up and find that you are nowhere near your airside tram station. So, more walking to find the correct station and ride the tram over to your airside. In my case, the airside has been redesigned (which means less space and more expensive restaurants).","{'neg': 0.07, 'neu': 0.841, 'pos': 0.089, 'compound': 0.937}",0.937

When I needed to change my flight and throughout the entire process I was never informed that flights would not be refundable. I was then informed that after I changed my flight the difference would be a credit I could use later, which doesn’t help me since I don’t normally fly with them. When I called for help with my dilemma and to try to get assistance from their customer service I was treated with indifference and disrespect and had to call multiple times and different places to finally get the information needed to file for an exception (I thought customer service was the norm) to get a refund of my money. Apparently they will hold your money hostage and give you the run around instead of trying to assist you. They certainly did not do me any favors or show me anything in the way of customer service, and I know that this makes me not only want to never fly Southwest again but warn everyone I know about this experience.

Not us, because we had booked a web awards special with miles. We get to the airport, still says on time, and as we get to our gate, their is an announcement saying to come to the desk because our flight is delayed and we are going to miss our connection. Surprise, not! Our flight to Chicago was delayed multiple hours, We ended up getting on an earlier flight to Chicago which was also delayed, then got on our delayed flight to PVD. Only arrived home a couple hours late, so not too bad.The reason we were upset is because it was so obvious that our flight was going to be delayed, yet American didn't say anything until an hour before we were scheduled to depart therefore making us sit around in the airport unnecessarily. Chicago was not moving very fast and it was clear that until they were operating at full speed, that all flights in STL would also be delayed. They knew this the night before but refused to offer free changes until they knew for certain the flight would be delayed. Here's what we would have preferred:1. Advanced notice that the flight was delayed. Then we could have stayed in our hotel for another few hours instead of getting up early to get to the airport, or:2. An option to rebook because we were not in a rush to get home. We would have been fine rebooking to the next day as we could have stayed another day in St Louis. We know the second one wasn't an option because we had booked a discount ticket which means you cannot change anything but everyone was being delayed and there were definitely other people who needed to get to their destinations faster.

First off there needs to be direct flights from Memphis going anywhere! It is ridiculous that everywhere you want to go when flying out of Memphis, TN you have to get a connecting flight.  My husband and I started out adventure leaving Memphis flying to Las Vegas by way of Phoenix. We get to the airport about an hour and a half before our schedulted 7:20am flight. We board the plane everyone gets comfortable, then the pilot says there is a mechanical problem and they are trying to fix it in the next few minutes. Cool! Not a problem. 25 minutes later the pilot says everyone has to get off the plant because they don't know how long it will take to fix the issue. Those passengers with connecting flights (approx. 95%) get in line once we all disembark the plane to re-schedule flights if we can. We sit at the gate for about 2 hours before a CSR says to us, ""I have been doing this job for a long time and I suggest you re-book your flight because this one may not be leaving today!"" Thank goodness my husband called the 800 # to see if he could get us on another flight trying to get to Phoenix. Well that didn't happen, but we were able to get on the 11:20am to Philadelphia which we would have a 7 hour layover.  Now we have been at the Memphis Airport since 5:45am. At this point I was over the whole situation and if it wasn't for the fact that we were going to a friend's wedding, I would have just gone back home and fought with AA for my money back. At least the equipment leaving out of Philadelphia was able to do so on time. The CSR and flight staff were very professional, gracious and apologetic about this whole situation. What I don't understand is WHY did the airport have to wait for a flight to come in from Dallas with the part that was needed to fix the original plane that we were on? This was a newer plane, so why was the part not accessible to the mechanics at that airport? Why was another plane not brought in to be used in this situation. Ever since Usairways decided to purchase American and use the American name the quality of service has gone down, meaning the equipment doesn't seem to be maintained as well as it should. Get it together American. There are other airlines out there that would be more than happy to have more business because you are failing in areas.","{'neg': 0.028, 'neu': 0.907, 'pos': 0.065, 'compound': 0.94}",0.94

She said Delta usually sends compensation automatically but if I did not hear from them in a week, to call.  When I did call, it took some work on my part to get more than $25.  ""Laura"" also told me while assisting the person checking me in,  that since I was over 2 hrs early, the best food was at a sit down restaurant in A (it was closed, boarded up).  She also told me that the only food on my flight was a 'snack'.  A snack in first class flying over was candy in a basket.  She said I should expect the same on Flt 1279.  In fact the flight served a terrible warm sandwich which included mystery meat, cheese, a rich dressing and something like chicken.  While getting candy in a basket is an insult for a first class flight of two hours, it would have been better than the meal I was served (no choices offered).  The flight itself (on Monday) went well with good flying conditions and attentive flight attendants.","{'neg': 0.048, 'neu': 0.866, 'pos': 0.085, 'compound': 0.9408}",0.9408

I'm sure it was but that didn't mean this was a pleasant experience. It just meant there were less employees on duty. Getting off the plane, we were led to believe we were going to baggage, then customs. Surprise! We had to wait behind 150 or so people to use the kiosks, devices created by Satan himself. Why kiosks? We already filled this information out on our customs papers and our photos are on our passports! The woman in charge sent me to the wrong kiosk where I was asked where I came from. Was she kidding? No. That only took 30 minutes. No big whoop. Next: customs and another huge line. Only 2 counters were open! The customs guy was having a great time chatting it up with passengers and taking his time. Good for him, bad for someone who is about to miss a flight. Next was baggage, where I waited about 10 minutes before being told our carousel had been changed. I waited another 10 minutes when, a staff member finally told me another employee across the way had my bag. Why? I don't know. At the airline counter the representative wanted to know how I was doing. I'm surprised she isn't afraid to ask that question. Then it was on to the TSA. Again, employees asking how you are. Please. The food selections are pitiful. One floor had a Starbucks, a pretzel store and a giant bar. It my be an alcoholic's dream but, no good for anyone looking for something resembling a meal. I will never use this airport again. If it's the only choice, I will go to another island instead.","{'neg': 0.074, 'neu': 0.8, 'pos': 0.126, 'compound': 0.941}",0.941

Anyway, as stated, not a fan of not having assigned seats but I am a fan of having 2 free checked bags.  Also, remember to download the Southwest app on your phone/tablet BEFORE boarding so you can enjoy their inflight movies/shows/etc.  It will not download once you are in the air (this, according to a flight attendant).

We have____, or ____...and how about a cocktail or some wine, to go with your lunch?"" -talk about raised eyebrows!! She was so genuinely sweet that I thought I was being punked!

The desk staff in the Delta Sky Club were accommodating and pleasant, but Delta’s corporate-level Sky-Club program attempts at accommodating their regular travelers is laughable when compared to other clubs.

","  |  Unpleasant security line experience. We were taking a 6am flight on Sunday and found ourselves in front of a huge line of travelers one hour ahead of the departure time. While it was our problem to not arrive earlier, I approached a mid-aged male staff guiding the traffic, asking if there is an express line for people with less than 30 minutes to departure, so that we can be prepared if we couldn't make it in time. First, upon seeing me approaching, the male staff just turned his back towards me, and I had to address him in the front for him to speak with me, and then instead of pointing me to a panel with waiting time (it was above the security check), he replied ""No, you have to wait in line."" I then asked: ""Do you think I can make it"", he says with such plain tones: ""I don't know, you need to arrive early"". And then he turned his back to me again! It wasn't like there were other people around waiting for his help.

We were told as a family there is no gaurentee we would be sat together but surprisingly we were (as their policy states no children under 16 is to be separated from their parents). The food is tasty enough. No children menu available- this has to be requested in advance. Although booked through Virgin, the flight was operated by delta and you can only check in 24 hours before departure online. Only small bags were included in the basic economy flight. Any larger suitcases to check in costs an extra £45 return per person. When we flew back from JFK they wanted to charge an additional $57 per suitcase to check in as we needed to provide proof. Apparently none of this information was located on their US system. We managed to show credit card statements so go out of paying for this. The aircrew flying out was ‘off’, seemed that they didn’t want to be there or serve you. The crew flying back was great.

Despite the low fuel costs, other airlines still charge a surcharge carrying on from the dark ages of air travel, as well as a lot of other make-belief, padding-of-their-bottom line charges!

The flight is operated with an E175 regional jet configured 1X2 in business class.  This is a nice regional jet as the overhead bins are large enough to accommodate standard size roll on board carry on cases so there was no need to gate valet check carry on luggage as is the case with older regional jets.  I had seat 1A, the single seat in the first row.  It is both a window and an aisle seat and being a bulkhead seat, the legroom is outstanding, better than on larger A321 jets.  The captain announced flight time was 2 hours 29 min.  Dinner was served on the flight, though it was cold food due to the short length of the flight.  I had the Asian salad with sesame dressing with a side of chicken, and there was even a small slice of cake for dessert.   The other choice was a Greek platter, presumably vegetarian.  For a short flight, I thought the meal offering was very good. Entertainment on the flight is supposed to be by connecting to the wifi and viewing the free movies and TV programs.  However, though my phone indicated it was connected to the wifi, there apparently was not enough signal to get the entertainment, or e-mails or whatsapp. One thing I did for the most recent journeys on American Airlines is to download the AA app, which I found to be quite useful as it reminded me of flights times, boarding times and boarding gates, but in particular for the track your bags feature which was very timely and allowed me to check on each flight that my checked luggage had made it onboard the plane.  Once connected to the in flight wifi, you can access the functions of the AA app for free (except of course on this flight on the E175 where I could not get the wifi to work, on previous flights on A321, the wifi and the AA app worked fine).","{'neg': 0.005, 'neu': 0.932, 'pos': 0.062, 'compound': 0.9464}",0.9464

As the flight departs at 7 am, I had to get to the airport very early before 5 am.  American has no lounge in Vancouver so unfortunately there was no place to wait other than at the gate.  Check in, security and US customs and immigration were all very quick early in the morning. The flight is operated with an E175 jet, a small 75 seater jet configured 1X2 in business and 2X2 in economy, with good sized overhead bins that can fit regular roll on board carry on bags.  I reserved seat 1A which is a bulkhead window seat by itself with no aisle seat next to it.  As it is a bulkhead seat with no seat in front of it, legroom is excellent and I could stretch out as much as I wanted, certainly more than in the same bulkhead seats on the larger jets.Flight time was announced to be 2 hours 23 minutes, with another 10 minutes from landing to parking at gate since the plane would have to taxi over to the American Airlines satellite terminal for its regional jets.  Pushback was on time at 6:56 am and takeoff was at 7:11 am.  We landed early at 9:38 am but lost a bit of time on the taxi to the gate as there was a lot of traffic on the taxiway.  We reached our gate at 9:56 am, which was an on-time arrival. For a short flight, I was impressed with the service in business class.  A full cold breakfast was served, either cold salmon or yogurt with fruit and muesli.   I opted for the cold salmon and it was a very full tray including mayonnaise potato wedges, fruit slices and danish.  Food quality was very good. American provides entertainment on its flights by wifi (free to watch the on board entertainment), but I was unable to connect to the wifi signal.  From experience on other flights, it seems the wifi signal is not that strong or reliable on the E175 regional jet, though wifi works well on the larger planes in the fleet.  As I could not connect to the wifi, I could not view the free entertainment as there are no screens in the plane itself.Overall for a short haul regional jet flight, I thought the product was very good with a fairly new plane with regular sized overhead bins and very good food service for a short flight.","{'neg': 0.05, 'neu': 0.865, 'pos': 0.086, 'compound': 0.9476}",0.9476

"," |    I like this airport. It's very clean and has friendly people. But it's really dragged down by the lack of decent food options in concourse C. With flights not serving meals, a traveler can come into the airport famished, with a short layover, and there's nothing. The only place to get a decent comfortable table is Chili's and the food there is simply awful. Plus the staff seem to find the back row of tables by the work station a great place to hang out and share raucous jokes. With five or six of them going at it on my last trip, you could hear them all down the concourse. Trying to pass a quiet hour with my laptop was wrecked by the noise, like being next to a tailgate party. And here's some feedback for the Chili's people. When I was there none of the shouting parties were watching the tables while we customers were craning our necks trying to get menus or drinks or whatever. I couldn't figure out why there were so many employees doing nothing except having fun in mid afternoon when there were very few customers, the cooks were making the food and the bartender was handling the bar. Just one waiter finally started handling tables and while he was very nice he forgot my silverware and water - separate trips for both - and seemed shaky on the whole process. The manager, whom I met briefly, seemed to have no clue that a restaurant, even Chili's, is supposed to serve customers, not double as a social club for staff. As a former restaurant owner, I ranked him as worthless. Anyway, we desperately need a pleasant place to sit with at least decent food that's not just tasteless Chili's fare, liquids, bready pre-made sandwiches or sugary pastries.","{'neg': 0.075, 'neu': 0.803, 'pos': 0.122, 'compound': 0.9481}",0.9481

It is cheaper than Alaska Airlines who we usually took to/from San Jose Del Cabo.  Southwest doesn't show up when you search using the regular search engines (Orbitz, Travelocity, Expedia, etc) so you have to search using their website directly.  They don't pre-assign seats so you have to go by the grouping on your boarding pass.  You can get a higher grouping by signing in for your flight as close to 24 hours previous to the flight as possible.  We were able to get group-A boarding by doing this.  When boarding, you can pick any open seat.  So it is best to board earlier to get the best selection.  We will definitely fly SouthWest Airlines in the future.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.893, 'pos': 0.107, 'compound': 0.9487}",0.9487

Friendly, wonderfully helpful and it has been a great experience in our time there. However, not so Vancouver airport! The World Duty Free was the worst I have ever encountered. Nearly all the staff were on cell phones and simply could not be bothered helping. When I did manage to get someone it was as though you were a complete nusience in asking them to drag themselves away from their cell phones. Then when there was no one in attendance at one area would anyone help from another area? No way. If I was in charge of this store I would sort out the staff, their ""I dont care about you"" attitude. It is an absolute disgrace to Vancouver and its fabulous city and people infact its an embarrassment. To encounter such dreadful attitudes as visitors leave your country needs to be addressed. I have rarely written a bad review however I feel very strongly about this. The ""Information centre"" staff cant muster up a smile or a decent greeting. When I asked one staff member in the domestic area (although I was international) after I said 'Hi May I ask for a bit of help with storing luggage' if it was a bad day for her, as the greeting I got was 'almost, out of line' she replied 'Im waiting for you to get on and tell me what you want!'

I can fly one round trip business flight for around $1,000 and earn enough points for another RT flight.  I do earn double points with my status though.  I also earn a companion pass for my wife each year and she can fly as frequently as she wishes absolutely free.  Bags are free and you can always change or cancel your flight with no additional fees.  This is the positive but its the negative that has me flying with American on longer flights.  On my last flight to BWI, there were 14 wheelchairs and many other pre boarders.  There are certainly people that need to pre-board but there as many people that game the system to board early and sit up front.  A simple solution would be for SW to enact a policy where pre boarders must sit in row 10 or higher.  This would put an end to all the games.  Also the number of people with ""emotional support"" dogs is ridicules.   25 year old females with their Yorkies who don't want to pay the $100 to take their pet.  I can purchase a one way ticket for $500+, receive an A-1 boarding pass and be the 25th person on the plane.  I will fly SW just enough to earn a companion pass and some points and fly American on the other flights.  The SW planes are smaller planes so the emergency exit rows don't really have much extra legroom.

Instead, Southwest issues boarding passes with groups listed (A, B, and C). Group A goes first by numerical order then Group B then Group C. To get in Group A, you will need to buy an ""early bird"" boarding pass. The early bird pass costs between $15-$25 each way. This allows you get get on the plane early to choose your seat. One of the major advantages of Southwest is that the airline allows 2 free checked bags. I have found Southwest crew to be very friendly and helpful.

I knew going in that DTW would be even busier with it being Christmas. When I got inside, the check-in kiosk for Delta did not recognize any of my information. This occurred in Greenville when I flew to Detroit on 12/21/18. I stood in a very long line for 30 minutes before reaching the check-in agent. The check-in agent could not help me at all and said I needed to go stand in ""a special line."" So, I go and I stand in another line, this time for maybe 15 minutes. Remember, I have a toddler, a car seat, and a carry on bag I am trying to handle by myself. This special check-in employee was able to check me in. Apparently because I had a minor flying with me, that is why the kiosk would not allow me to check-in. Then I was told that while they could check the car seat for free under Delta policy, I would need to walk to the other side of the Delta check-in terminal and place it with the oversized luggage. Now I had to walk across the terminal to drop the car seat off and then walk all the way back to the other side I started at in order to go through security. Again, remember that I am one adult trying to manage a car seat, a toddler, and a carry-on bag. I finally get back to the other side of the check-in terminal and to domestic security check. Thankfully we were able to get through security rather quickly. Then you have one TSA agent who was literally having almost every bag in his line be checked. I had a back pack and a carry-on that needed to be checked, which means additional wait time because only one person was there going through items. I know TSA has to do their jobs, but this agent was flagging almost every bag going through (I watched him with the bags before and after ours). Yes, I had toys from Christmas morning we were trying to get home to SC. I have flown in and out of Detroit numerous times to visit my family in MI. I have never experienced such frustration and utter anger with Detroit as I did yesterday. Dtw is not made for parents who are flying solo with a child, plain and simple. There are no courtesy strollers or luggage carriers with a child seat attached. When I expressed my frustration to a Delta agent about being a solo parent trying to fly with a minor and being told to wait and then walk all over the airport, all I got was backlash about how everyone has to do it. It is not hard to be parent/child friendly.","{'neg': 0.027, 'neu': 0.901, 'pos': 0.072, 'compound': 0.9524}",0.9524

First of all, in Houston check-in and baggage check is so much better than the other airline choices. Delta does use a Kiosk for check-in but their App makes the Kiosk unnecessary. The baggage check was handled at the counter by Delta not like the other Airlines who make you print your own baggage tags, place the labels on by yourself and then haul them to another location to check them in. One smooth procedure to check-in and check bags with Delta. Both of my flights were not only on time but ahead of schedule! The service on the plane is a better experience than the other airlines. Also, Delta's hub is Atlanta. The other choices have you going through Chicago, which is horrible or Charlotte, NC with short connection times. Atlanta airport does a great job of moving you from one terminal to the next via the Train Plane. Delta has connection times that allow you to make your connection and usually grab a quick sandwich between flights. I would rather have an hour and half between flights than a quick 25-30 minutes to de-plane, change terminals (usually a long distance) and board the next flight.The service on-board the plane was very good and professional.

After I spoke to him many times online my partner expressed her wish for me to know her dad personally and spend some time with them both at his place in Sun City in Bluffton SC. We used Delta Airlines miles to purchase this trip. I must say for the dates we chose, the miles needed for this trip were much lower than our expectations so we were very happy with this. I flew out of Aruba and since it was a short trip I didn't need more than my backpack and a carry on. I checked in online and had no issues with this. At the Aruba Airport Delta airline counter the agents were helpfull and effective since the line was moving at a good pace. The info at the gate was accurate and clear, the boarding process was well organized. I chose an isle seat since I can't sleep in a seated position and therefore take that seat to avoid waking up fellow passengers when I need to go to the bathroom. I love the choice of the board entertainment and the fact that it's free. The flight attendants were very helpful and genuinly friendly. The trip was smooth, a turbulence is a weather phenomenon so a bumby ride cannot be attributed to the carrier nor the crew. Being an experienced traveler I know this and therefore won't comment on the bumbs the weather throws my way. Arriving in Atlanta and being an experienced traveler I searched the monitors and went to my next departing gate that was actually the one we arrived into. The rest of the trip (the leg to Charleston) was equal to the one from Aruba so I will not repeat the same story and bore you to death. LOL.Returning to Aruba was challenging because the online system kept requesting a return date and didn't recognize the fact that I was returning home and not visiting Aruba thus I could not check in online. This repeated itself at the self checkin station at the Charleston Airport. I was then assisted by a gate agent and had to prove I was a resident of Aruba and having a European Union passport didn't help but this is only a fact because Aruba is still part of the Dutch Kingdom, thus our nationality is Dutch even when we are legal citizens of Aruba. It's a good thing that I had my General Health Insurance card that proves I live there legally with me (because only legal residents are covered by the General Health Insurance) to prove I have an address there and my travel insurance docs also proved the info that my home address is in Aruba. This may need some looking into by the IT people that manage the Delta online check in feature. Other than that (and the minor fact that the weather caused a delay taking off in Charleston) I made my connecting flight in Atlanta and the rest of the story remains the same.

Then they announced the gate and we saw a flight delay.  They kept saying 10 more min.  10 more min. 10 more min.  But thankfully the Captain came out to the group of people.  He said the weather radar went down and he could not fly to Baltimore because of storms that way.  he said he could follow the coast to Houston Tx, so we were going there instead.  As you can imagine everyone freaked out.  Worried about whether the plane was safe and some folks were catching connections in Baltimore.  At first they said they were going to put everyone on a plane in Houston and it only had 33 seats, there were many more folks than that and everyone was worried.  No one knew what to do.

Arrived at airport 90 min pre-flight, turned in rental car, and waited more than 20 minutes for the shuttle from car garage to terminal.  (The shuttle wasn't brand-specific, it was the shuttle for all car companies, from the FLL garage to Departures.)  I ALREADY had checked in and had boarding pass, so I entered the baggage-drop line inside (60 minutes pre-flight).  The airport was crowded, and the line didn't move for a very long time.  Delta did not have any employees surveying the line to look for potential flight misses, or to advise customers on other options.  I watched constantly for an employee to help me.  People were queued in front of me, and behind me. There was nobody I could ask for help.  At 45 minutes pre-flight, the wife of the married couple behind me left her luggage w/ husband and left the queue to seek help.  She came back w/ a Delta employee who escorted them out of the queue to drop their luggage & make their flight.  I don't know how much money they gave the Delta employee.  While the Delta employee was taking their bags, I asked him if he would also help me.  He said no, he wouldn't.  He said at 45 minutes, it was too late for me to make my flight.  So I remained trapped in the queue.  At 40 minutes preflight i saw him walking again, and again asked him if he would help me, and I showed him I already had my boarding pass and just needed to drop my bags.  He said no, he couldn't help me.  I didn't have any cash on my to give him.  And that is how I will always remember Delta... DELTA WILL HELP CERTAIN CUSTOMERS, BUT WON'T HELP OTHERS.  Delta was understaffed.  When I got to the front of the queue, it was 25 minutes pre-flight.  I had waited in the baggage-drop line for 35 minutes.  The attendant was apologetic that no employee had helped me in line, and she found me a flight departing 32 HOURS LATER, FROM A DIFFERENT AIRPORT 1 hour away.  I had to pay a large amount of money for the price difference.  I've learned a lesson about flying on the Saturday after New Years', and I've also learned to never fly with Delta because they can't provide adequate service during busy times, they treat rich customers better than they treat avg people, and they didn't accept any fault for their slow service and lack of line attendants, which caused myself and other Delta customers to miss flights.","{'neg': 0.053, 'neu': 0.861, 'pos': 0.085, 'compound': 0.9552}",0.9552

First, their policy on allowing NO FEE changes in your travel arrangements. Second, there is NO CHARGE for checked baggage, up to two pieces per passenger. (Within reasonable weight limits, of course) and allows two carryon pieces, one smallish, like a briefcase or purse/backpack. The staff is always courteous and helpful, accommodating to people with special needs, The planes always appear clean and tidy. They are great about communicating, either with delays or issues that come up. For example, they communicated with passengers on upcoming trips about their extra measures they are taking to prevent the spread of virus. Top notch company in every way.

Unfortunately, the economy seats on this aircraft do not recline more than a half inch, if that, and was very uncomfortable on such a long flight and me caused neck issues when trying to sleep. (We were NOT in a row where this reclining issue would normally occur, like right in front of an exit, or the back row.)  But the main issue was that in spite of a detailed phone call with an agent several days before, and an assurance that all would be handled, my husband's special vegan meal did not make it to the ""list"" on the plane, and they had no food for him for the flight other than a regular meal he would not eat. We were informed of this by a rather harried and not very helpful flight attendant, who basically said to take it up with Corporate, which is of course no help on the actual flight. Another flight attendant managed to scrounge up some potato chips and fruit for him later on, but otherwise there was nothing for him to eat except some nuts he'd brought along. To me, this is terrible customer service. To be fair, my gluten free meal was just fine, and the regular meals of our traveling companions were quite good, according to them. I had also spoken, in that same conversation, about possibly using my CPAP on board. I was assured that someone from Special Assistance would call me before the flight. That never happened, and since we were traveling the few days before, I wasn't able to call them again. So again, their customer service is really problematic. I did contact Corporate with these issues, and they apologized and offered us miles to compensate.

Sadly, we were not able to upgrade on our initial segment from BOS to MIA, and the flight was close to full. The seating was so tight, it was difficult to sufficiently move to use the AC plugs located near the floor. This is not an exaggeration, it is the reality, and I'm just an average height and weight. Their entertainment system wasn't working correctly on my laptop (flash issues?) and I gave up. Free WiFi? Get serious.Ironically, I received a survey from American after my flight. They provided a box for comments at the end of the survey. My comment was as follows: If American wants to understand the service they provide, have their executives fly economy! I can't say American is much worse than some of the other airlines we use. JetBlue used to be better, but they are now comparable to American. We recently flow Aer Lingus, an equally mediocre airline. The best we've used recently was Alaska Air, which seems to be a notch above those mentioned.Our second segment from MIA to Curacao we upgraded to Business. It's much better in business, though certainly not impressive. There is adequate space and legroom. A hot meal is served, and it's a quieter and more relaxing environment. It's fine.

We wiped everything down, like many other passengers were doing. When we pointed out the mess to the crew they were oh well, that’s when we realized that they were not going to remove whatever it was, they need disposable gloves now.We sat waiting for pilots to arrive, then do their safety check which made us about 40 mins late leaving, no one was really concerned obviously it happens a lot with AA.Flight was ok, pretzels & a Diet Coke oh my how spoilt we felt, easy job working on that flight for the crew.Shout out to the people on the ground at the Cancun airport they were very friendly, helpful and being a small number of passengers we went through quickly.","{'neg': 0.061, 'neu': 0.818, 'pos': 0.121, 'compound': 0.9595}",0.9595

My husband was also offered an oatmeal breakfast, but it was coldly announced to him without much of explanation.  Besides serving the breakfast not much of other interaction during the 5 hours flight.  In contrast Suzy walked the aisle  to fill my hot water many times, very attentive.  Suzy say thank you to all her passengers 10 minutes before landing and appreciated us flying AA.

Honestly, this is a hard airport to like because it just seems stuck in 1989. But this is also a hard airport to truly dislike, as I've never had a particularly negative experience there. The biggest selling point for me is that I don't ever remember coming across rude or gruff personnel, even TSA during peak traffic hours. I'm sure a rude TSA or ticket agent exists at Bush, because it's a massive American airport after all, but I've thankfully never encountered them! They have a pretty cool display in (I believe) the American terminal which walks one through the evolution of Houston's space program history, nothing fancy or attention-calling, just factual with a few artifacts. There is a selection of decent bars and restaurants throughout, though not much in the way of anything Texas-specific that I can recall. Other than these things, the terminals are dirty. United's terminals are separated and disjointed. Security lines can be painfully slow if you don't have TSA Pre-Check or clear. The airport is honestly one of the dirtiest I've ever been to in the developed world - yes, I just reiterated the point! Seating is very crowed, and so are places to actually charge your phone, iPad, or Kindle. As I said, it looks like the airport hasn't been updated (or, in some cases, even cleaned) since 1989 - when George H.W. Bush, this airport's namesake, was actually president! Some parts of the airport have an indescribably strange smell that I can only describe as dank and damp. The WiFi connectivity is something I'd expect in a developing African country (or Australia, where it's also surprisingly bad). The shuttle bus system from and to economy parking lots is just chaotic and abnormally unsystematic - and illogical. Honestly, if the City of Houston could just improve the layout and dump a lot of money into modernization, Bush would honestly be an amazing airport! Until then, it's like an old lawnmower: just barely running on choke mode while sitting in idle. What a shame.","{'neg': 0.12, 'neu': 0.719, 'pos': 0.161, 'compound': 0.96}",0.96

So, this didn’t look like a last-minute change.  Or, was it?  If you’re going to have a change of planes, be honest about it!  If it’s planned in advance, say so at the beginning!  If it’s a last-minute change, tell all your passengers ASAP!  And, not at the last minute!  There was no mention of this change when I checked my phone before leaving for the LAS airport.  And, there was also no apology for the change of planes made to us inbound passengers.  Also, this new flight was 21 minutes late in pushback from the gate at DEN (At least it wasn’t 9F degrees and snowing this time!), making us late into IAD.  The A+ on this evaluation is for the DEN-IAD cabin crew.  While both of the forward FA’s were the cheerful and friendly usually expected on WN, one of them had to “protect/defend” the area of the forward lav/cockpit door while the captain was in that area (restroom break) and a possibly inebriated passenger (He was swaying quite a bit!) made his way towards the area while one FA was blocking his path.  He (much larger male) kept approaching and she had to get quite demonstrative that she was prepared to “deal” with him if he continued his approach. At about row three (I was in 5C), he finally got the message and turned around.  In the 45 years since my first commercial flight (9/17/65 IAD-LHR on a TWA B707-331), this was the first time I’d seen an FA have to do what they’re supposed to do in the first place: Ensure the safety of the passengers!  When I complemented her later on what I’d observed, she initially brushed it off as if it happened every day.  If that’s the case, I pity the FA’s for a task more thankless than I’d previously thought.  I’m contacting WN about her performance.","{'neg': 0.04, 'neu': 0.883, 'pos': 0.077, 'compound': 0.9619}",0.9619

I purchased what I believe was called Basic Economy, the cheapest fare possible.  The problem was they didn't let you pick your seats.  I figured we'd be all right but my wife was worried that we wouldn't get  to sit together.  At our flight change in Atlanta, we asked someone at a desk if we could get our seat assignments.  He gruffly told us no, that we couldn't get them till we got to our gate.  Not friendly at all.  We got to our gate and to our relief we had been seated together in the back row of the plane.  That was okay.  Then we found out that they had moved our gate to the end of another wing so we had to rush over to the new gate.  Finally, as we were about to board, I looked up at the seat assignment screen and saw that our seats had changed.  I asked the lady at the desk if our seats could change.  She said no but then thought for a second and said that yes they had changed because someone had requested the back seats.  We get on the plane and find out that we were in an exit row with lots of leg room.  So it turned out good but I will not say buying basic economy is a good idea.  It is just another way that airlines are charging more after advertising a cheap price, just like charging for luggage.  Otherwise the flight was fine.  The good part was that we could fly home from a small airport so the boarding process was quite easy.","{'neg': 0.045, 'neu': 0.85, 'pos': 0.104, 'compound': 0.962}",0.962

There were lots of USB charging ports available in the lounge, although we use secure dongles whenever we use those.  Mid-afternoon I went to see what the bar was like.  I was just hoping for a glass of wine.  To my surprise, there were many bottles of wine and all sorts of spirits, all in a self-service bar area!  I discovered a tasy red and enjoyed 2 glasses before we boarded our evening flight across the pond.We had the first 2 center BC seats.  Our lay-flat seats slid into a cubbyhole in front of us.

The queues make no sense and merge into each other for boarding passes and bag drop off. There is a system and it could work well if there were instructions anywhere. You first need to weigh your check in bags and the screens are really self explanatory. You have good choices to use eticket scan, input flight confirmation no. Scan passport etc. The machine then walks you through weighing bags etc before printing off your boarding passes, bag tags and receipt for any costs. You then need to join the bag drop off queue once you work out where it ends as the queues for the bag weigh machines stem out around circular hubs and invariably merge with the single bag drop queue. Once youve dropped off your bag, you need to work out which security queue you need to be in. Security B is TSA and the others A, C and D are for all others. We were in C despite this being clearly labelled international when we were going to Mainland US. Once you get through security, options for food etc are ok. Toilets were dated but clean. There is free WiFi and sockets to charge phones etc free. Travel to the gates is far easier by foot than the further confusion of the wiki wiki bus. The airport is small enough to get to any of the gates within 10 mins Walking and theyre well signposted (although your bags are scanned again as you technically go outside albeit undercover).

From the drive into TPA, the airlines are cleverly color coded and then you are directed to either arrivals or departures. Then you simply have to look for the door with your airline. Once inside the main terminal, head to the appropriate ticket counter. If you have pre-checked in online, just take the air conditioned tram to your terminal (AF). There you will go through security. Theres always ample TSA agents there to keep the crowd moving along securely and swiftly. Once through security, you are welcomed into a massive airy terminal. Theres plenty of food options from Cigar City Brewing (a popular craft beer producer in Tampa) to The Colombia Restaurant, a staple in Tampa since 1905 serving authentic Spanish fair. Theres plenty of workspace and outlets to charge up your devices. I flow the flow of this airport with plenty of signage.

Weather a little rainy and 49 no problem should be good to go but no wait a minute.  Apparently this plane can't fly with the amount of people on it if the weather is wet and under 50 degrees.  After an hour on the plane waiting for temp to rise.  Offers were made to 6 passengers to get off so the rest could continue on apparently that lowered the weight enough to be able to fly. What should have been 3 hours on the plane ended up 5 hours.  Arrive Dallas (two in my party had a tight connection which they missed and rebooked to my flight to Maui) go to gate no plane.  30 minutes from takeoff still no plane announcement made that they were looking for a replacement airplane due to delays with original plane that would have taken us.  Good news you will get to Maui today just don't know when.  We are going to bring you some snacks but feel free to run eat while we find a replacement its probably going to be while.  We popped into a restaurant ordered and just as the food was put in front of us we get the text boarding in 20 minutes lol.  Choked it down and headed back to gate hurry up and wait.  Finally on board prediction for arrival moved out 1 1/2 from original time plane should have got in.  Quick text to friends who were meeting us at airport car rental on different flight to let them know they would have to wait on us or uber to hotel.  Once on board things were fine but in a seating issue my husband and I were not together amazingly enough we were able to fix that with some switching.  Families all over the plane were complaining about seating being changed from their initial choices of being spread all over.   Arrived in Maui thanks.  So surely my return flights will go well.  It's American so that would be a no.  Delays again coming home. Plane on long flight with complimentary entertainment oops its unavailable for who knows what reason.   This is my second trip in 6 months with American and both trips were a pain due to this airline.  My trip in Sept. they just decided not to fly on the day I was to return home so I had to cut a day off my trip to accommodate them or add one which would have added hundreds of dollars to my trip.  They really don't care at all about their customers they know we don't have options especially in small markets.  Oh and before I forget my daughter and 2 year old grandson were seated across aisle from each other American's choice not theirs thankfully day of flight people switched around.

They went on to tell me that “weather” meant de-icing a plane in Minnesota 2 flights before my original flight. Apparently de-icing planes in December is considered “weather” when it comes to delays and allows them to avoid responsibility for stranding their customers overnight in connection cities. Apparently ice is not something Southwest accommodates for in winter months. Cool. Just be warned: this airlines loves to pretend they treat their customers well when it actually means herding them cattle onto flights instead of assigning seats like every other civilized airline. They also looooooove to tell you that delays are not their fault. They’ve gotta recoup those baggage costs someway; right?

We are Canadian so our final stop was Windsor Ontario. We made the reservations through Cheapo Air. It was a nightmare in getting confirmation waiting for credit verification. I called my bank and they were not the hold up and were prepared to approve. Follow up re approval for oxygen and a scooter were also problematic.On Tuesday March 3 Trump terminated flights from Europe. We heard him a few weeks before saying he may close the southern border. We decided because of the uncertainty of Trump, we could not take a chance and should return home while we still could. We spent three agonizing and unfruitful days trying to get rescheduled through Cheapo Air and Aeromexico. Finally, I told my husband to call Delta and we could not get through. He finally went to the Airport on Thursday March 12 and saw a Delta counter booking flights. She cancelled the Aeromexico flights on March 28 and applied the refund to a Delta flight on March 16. She finalized the approvals for my oxygen and scooter. (We had all the information for these.) She referred it to another gentleman, and It was completed in five minutes. I cannot tell you how grateful we were. Don’t know her or his name but they were fabulous and deserve to be thanked.We were on the Delta flight which left PV at 12:40 pm to arrive in Detroit on March 16, 2020.

However, this airport, given that it serves the needs of New Yorkers travelling to points east of the Mississippi, and Canada, is extremely convenient. A short taxi ride brings you to the airport. The distance from the entrance to the gates is very, very short. Thus, you save a lot of time. From being dropped off at the entrance gate of the terminal to the TSA check area, it is less than a one minute walk - if you have your boarding pass with you. The gates are immediately thereafter. I am sure once the new terminals are constructed, the walks will be long and I will have to trudge long distances to my gate. I used Terminal B for a United flight from Gate C9. C9 is at the end of the terminal pier. So this is a very convenient, straight forward, quick terminal to use. In less than 5 minutes, including TSA inspection I was at my gate! I did not check any bags. Ample seating and quite a few electric connections to charge your phones all around. At this end, with the large glass windows, not only is the waiting areas bright, thanks to natural light streaming in, you can see flights landing and taking off. I was given TSA pre-check and going through the security inspection was a quick walk in the park. I did not have to pull out my laptop or liquids or even shed my coat or remove my footwear; I had put the phone in my bag. Food stalls after TSA are few but basic snacks and sandwiches are available. A little bit of research before coming to the airport can help travelers prepare for the services available and thus manage expectations. While the airport currently handles more traffic and passengers than it was built for, this is the airport where you can be at your gate from arriving at the terminal in just a few short minutes. A great convenience to busy, on the go New Yorkers!","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.931, 'pos': 0.069, 'compound': 0.9656}",0.9656

We went through customs easily with the chair, but when we collected our luggage, I couldnt handle the luggage and my husband. He rolled himself from the luggage to where United Air collected luggage. We then had to go through TSA again. I inquired about pre-check in TSA and the official directing people yelled at me and because of her strong accent I couldnt understand her. When I asked her again she just got furious and turned her back on us. We ended up in the non-pre TSA which was a nightmare with all our carry ons and a wheelchair. They took the wheelchair away and made my husband go through a complete search because his arm and hip replacements set off the equipment. Finally we reached the United Gate and they were almost through boarding even though we allowed plenty of time for this transition. We were sent out in the rain to get to our plane to San Luis Obispo. Because of the weather, they needed 8 volunteers to get off the plane for weight reasons. Finally they decided to remove all the baggage so o one had to leave the plane. (Good idea). The plane took off 1.5 hours late. United Air did a good job of Tracking our luggage. It went down to LA and arrived several hours later in San Luis Obispo. When I tried to pick up my luggage in SLO, the clerk at the united counter was the rudest person and of no help. She instructed me to stand by a door and hope someone would help me. It took 20 minutes. A very nice airport employee, arriving for work took pity on me and opened the door that had the luggage.

We weren't thrilled at the prospect, having avoided Manchester for some years now on the basis of its size and overcrowding. In the event, things were much better than expected, mainly because both flights were at quiet times of day. Passage through security took only a few minutes and, though both of us had our hand luggage selected for separate inspection, the security staff were very pleasant and in no way officious. On our return, we were quickly through the electronic passport gates and actually back to our car in JetPark 1 within 20 minutes or so of landing. So, as far as the basic function of transit from car park to plane and back again was concerned, we had no problems at all. I would still say, however, that Manchester airport is somewhere I would prefer to avoid: some of the signage is confusing, many of the seats in the main central area of Terminal One were ripped and in need of replacement and the route from plane to terminal exit seemed to involve several staircases up or down. The sight of the extensive chicanes at security and passport control, not in use when we transited, was also a clear indication of what the airport must be like at peak times. As for finding one's way around the exterior of the airport, I can only be glad that all we needed was to access JetPark 1 and let the transfer bus drivers do the rest! All in all, though we actually got off very lightly, our enforced return to Manchester made us appreciate Liverpool airport all the more.","{'neg': 0.067, 'neu': 0.813, 'pos': 0.12, 'compound': 0.9667}",0.9667

Making connections is stressful and just not worth any money saved over taking a nonstop flight.  I’m very lucky that I could go round trip to Buenos Aires and have American Airlines flight 996 nonstop available. This is another reason I don’t mind living in DFW area.Unfortunately the bean counters at all airlines continue to make sitting in regular economy very uncomfortable even for a man like me who is only 5’9” tall and 165 pounds. I have flown as a passenger since I was a baby. I notice how space in economy has become extremely uncomfortable for all. To add insult to injury Airlines are nickel-and-diming us for checking bags when flying economy. They use lowered entry prices to get you in and then start tacking on additional fees for whatever they feel like charging to get back to the profit margin they need even for the lowest basic economy fare.As I get older, with all the above facts; I now either use my airline miles or pay extra to go premium economy or business class whenever possible. Selecting to flights with wide body jets helps a lot too just from the sense of additional space overhead. Yes, airline marketing strategies have gotten to me by beating me into submission.I paid about $2000 for my round-trip, premium economy airfare on American Airlines flight number 996 in a 777-200 aircraft, nonstop, from DFW to BUE flying late February through March 2020.Doing so gave me priority boarding status group 4. It also allowed me one free check-on bag. The best part is that premium economy on American Airlines  777 aircraft provides a much larger, wider, reclining seat. You also get a little perks like the pillow, blanket, eye mask, ear plugs, toothpaste, toothbrush, and headphones. The best perk is that the alcoholic drinks are included. All of the above is especially important when you fly inside an aircraft for just over 10 hours. I cannot compromise on more decent, basic comforts we’re flying this long. So in summary I am forced to upgrade from basic economy to reach What I must have as a basic comfort level.I choose American Airlines because I really don’t have that many alternatives even being in a hub like DFW. If I could find a suitable alternative I’ll take it because paying this much money for a flight to me means I should receive service from cabin attendants  who enjoy their job and don’t mind caring for me rather than just being done with me.American Airlines usually does a fair job of getting me onboard and on time, efficiently serving (albeit not always warm and friendly), and doing their overall job.","{'neg': 0.072, 'neu': 0.812, 'pos': 0.117, 'compound': 0.9692}",0.9692

American now has 3 classes in the 787-9 running the route, but First is gone and there is main cabin then Premium economy and Business.  This time Premium economy which costs about $500 USD more RT than regular economy was to me certainly worth the extra money. Remember these are 12 hours +or- flights. First you are put in group 4 which is priority boarding. Also your checked luggage is tagged priority with a big orange tag. The seats are spaced 2-3-2 rather than 3-3-3 so they are wider, also have about 6 inches more legroom allowing for a better recline and a leg/foot rest that can be used like a lounge chair ( The same as 1st was years ago)  On your seat will be a plastic bag filled with a blanket, pillow, large over ear headphones, slippers, and a toiletry case with toothbrush, paste, lotions etc inside.  Also find a full size bottle of spring water. Just after takeoff the f/A’s come around asking what you want to drink. (Wine,beer,cocktails (Made yourself) soft drinks etc.. About 1.5 hours into the flight dinner is served from a choice of 3 entre’s you can choose ahead of time on the APP if you care to.  Mid flight is a snack (Stromboli or beef pie) and ice cream.  About 2 hours before arrival is a full breakfast.  All except the snacks are served on china, with metal flatware and real cloth napkins, cups are still plastic. There is PLENTY of food to eat, also the kitchenette is open all flight between service for snacks and water. Premium economy in the 787-9 is only 3 rows of 7 (21 seats) so select early. We chose 9A and 9C which are with a bulkhead so plenty of room.  Dedicated restroom though when service carts blocked the aisles some economy passengers passed thru into Premium sections for the restroom.     The flight attendants were ample and attentive.

When I booked our flight early in this year I booked a nonstop flight from Tampa airport to Midway airport in Chicago.  Then my flight was changed to a direct flight from Tampa to Columbus then on to Midway in Chicago, which also changed the total time and the departure time.  When we landed in Columbus we were told we had to change planes to continue on to Midway in Chicago.  Our original arrival time at Midway was supposed to be 8:15, but with the changes it wasn’t until approximately 9:30, and by the time we got to our car and pulled out of the economy parking garage, it was 10:30.  Now we had to drive and hour and a half to our home in Indiana.The confusing part is how a nonstop flight turns into a direct flight and then into a plane change.  I fly Southwest for both pleasure and for business, and hopefully Southwest can be a little more proactive to inform its passengers concerning flight changes.  We did get home safely, and for that we are happy, but being on a, originally 2:30 nonstop flight, flight from 6:15 to 9:30, and then driving home, makes for a long evening into the night.","{'neg': 0.018, 'neu': 0.88, 'pos': 0.103, 'compound': 0.9695}",0.9695

She kept us on hold and checked back every couple of minutes as she navigated several contacts to various “help desk” and other agencies to search for a flight. We used Alaska Air miles to make our original purchase which also complicated matters. Mrs. Cook was successful in getting us a return flight on Qantas Air out of Sydney, Australia. She made all the connecting flight arrangements and provided us with all the information to accommodate the journey.

From the very beginning in our economy seats, we were given first class treatment starting with giving everyone a hot towel then a placemat for your tray including plastic silverware that could actually cut chicken without breaking.  We were also offered bottled water - full bottles.  They came around giving free earbuds, pillows, blankets, and sleep kits including ear plugs, wipes, and a sleeping mask.  The media center offered great movie options, too.  Recent movies!  Worked perfectly.  Our 8 hour flight was really a 10 hour flight to JFK due to bad winds and it was a bumpy ride but no complaints.  We were then offered an appetizer, entree and dessert along with any cocktail.  The chicken was delicious!  I know, shocking!  The salted caramel ice cream was also delicious.  No complaints.  They later came through to offer another drink before we settled in to sleep.  Unfortunately, we sat close to the restrooms so we did get some bad odors on occasion.  I will try to avoid this area in the future.  After a while, we were served warm cookies and another drink.  Then, another hot towel and a quick entree with dessert.  The BBQ chicken pizza pocket had too many jalapenos in it and was way too spicy but still tasty.  The service is amazing.  For your second entree, you got another clean placemat!  Like I mentioned, first class service!  I will definitely fly Delta again.

Was it worth it? Maybe. Maybe not. I have extreme allergies to colognes and perfumes. As in, I can't breathe if someone near me is perfumed up.

The check in process was smooth, as long as you follow the luggage weight restrictions.  Having your ID and general flight information helps accelerate the process.  At the gate, they usually have an initial brief few minutes prior to boarding to explain the flight status and expectations.  The seats are previously assigned which allows the customers to move to their seats.  I think an opportunity for the airline is to enhance the cabin filling operation which should flow the customers and fill from back to front.  During the flight, you can certainly experience that flight attendants usually care about their passengers.  Try the biscoff cookies because you will like them.  After the flight, the airline has figured out how to get the luggage from the airplane to the carousel, waiting time is almost none.  Overall, the experience was pleasant and I felt safe.

On the longest flights, everyone had their own television.Since I am disabled and have a hard time walking long distances, I did call the airline to set up wheelchairs from gate to gate. Each person I encountered as a Porter was lovely and kind. They knew their way around their airport and took pride in their airport and their job.

On a recent trip to Cancun I was, once again, happy with Southwest. We were going to Mexico for our son’s wedding in Tulum, so my husband and I both had more luggage than usual with our clothes for the wedding week activities. I loved that we could each check two bags free, and still allowed me a carry-on where I’d packed all our clothes for the wedding. That way, if a bag was lost, I’d still have our clothes for the wedding! Flights were on-time, and we actually landed about 25 minutes early. Our flight attendants were all very nice in both legs of the trip. I also like the size of the seats on Southwest. Some airlines have uncomfortably small seats in economy class. I’m a fairly small person and they’re too small for me! The downside of flying Southwest, of course, is no assigned seats. If you get a C group boarding pass you may sit in a middle seat or not get to sit with your travel companion if the flight is full.  But, you can pay $25 extra and be guaranteed A group boarding. All in all, with great fares, nice flight attendants, and comfy seats Southwest is my favorite airline.

0.9704,2019-09-01,2019-09-01,20.0,What's the WORST thing about flying Southwest?,"Yes, you're correct! Obviously it's the ""no assigned"" seats, AKA ""cattle call"", boarding policy.  Better than it used to be; I remember when it was a mad rush, people pushing and shoving to get on first.  Now they have Boarding Groups and those large groups are broken down further into groups of 5.  So it's a little better.  Still, this only works when the passengers actually get into line in the assigned order.  And because the gate personnel hardly ever actually check the boarding pass to ensure that passenger belongs in that group, cheating is rampant.  So the best thing to do was pay the $25 to get Early Bird.  That used to put you in the A group, so at least you got a decent seat.  But now they are putting Business Select, and Rapid Rewards A list passengers, and Anytime Fare passengers, and God knows who else, into the A group, so the Early Bird option is now buying you A59 or even putting you in the B group.  Better to just skip the Early Bird, and call in 24 hours before your flight to reserve your group.  Lastly, Southwest - if you are going to offer the option to have your agent call a passenger back rather than make them wait on hold (a wonderful policy!), maybe when you call them back you could really have an agent ready to speak to them instead of putting them on hold for a couple more minutes?","{'neg': 0.036, 'neu': 0.85, 'pos': 0.115, 'compound': 0.9704}",0.9704

The service and in-flight amenities are very nice.  However, their passenger processing is lacking substantially.

In 3 separate instances a random seat change to either one or both of us occurred, to accommodate other parties that booked together (most likely less far enough in advance to afford seat availability needed for the whole party of travelers).  When my friend and I book together on the same reservation, we have never been split.  Yet, when we book independently, we are almost always split.  My thought is that since we APPEAR TO BE single passengers, Delta assumes it is acceptable to change our seats.  Why?  I could simply book a less expensive Basic Economy ticket and  then be understandably randomly seated. At least the inconvenience is less expensive.  This practice of re-assigning a person's premium reservation seat is so fraudulent!  If you PAY to pick a seat, then that seat should be honored. Why is it OK for Delta to inconvenience a single passenger reservation to meet the needs of anyone else if the single passenger paid for select seating privilege (I am not speaking with respect to meeting passengers with special needs; this was obviously not the case in my experiences).What should be a 5 star review is tainted by this PATTERN of behavior by Delta Airlines.","{'neg': 0.05, 'neu': 0.814, 'pos': 0.136, 'compound': 0.9709}",0.9709

It had been a decade since my last flight, and the price was most affordable.  Flying is a thrill and a luxury for me, not like taking a subway, and when I fly I like to have a window seat with a clear view.  For me it's half the fun to see our beautiful country from up high.  I also expect the basics, a clean vessel and safe flight.  First of all, there is absolutely NO REASON to pay the extra $20 for whatever improved seating you are hoping to find with the stadium style seating mode.  It guarantees NOTHING!!!   On this recent series of four flights, my four boarding positions were always A06-07 which should have ensure the seats I wanted.  Without sounding insensitive, about thirty passengers would get on first who had special needs and sat in the choicest seats without the upgrade cost I paid which left me over the wing or in the cheap seats.   The pre-board lining up at the numbered poles based on boarding number on ticket is akin to going to the greyhound station or returning from elementary school recess and no one really abides by the number given, a travel free-for-all.  The cabin felt like it was never tidied up between boarding, magazines awry, seat belts disshuffled, not a hint of disinfectant in the air.  Worrisome with the chorus of coughing heard and knowing that air was recirculating to a your nose.In all fairness, the attendants were always pleasant and accommodating.  The pilots are exceptional and drive the 737 like a sports car, very smoothly, and I am very confident with their skill.  The fare is competitive.Between the cattle car boarding, no guarantee of the seat I expect and at a higher cost, and the possibility of the killer 737 MAX being reinstated, I think I'll pay a little more with another carrier and have a set seat and civility.","{'neg': 0.072, 'neu': 0.793, 'pos': 0.135, 'compound': 0.9711}",0.9711

I was supposed to have flown from Toronto to West Palm Beach with @Air Canada but the complete booking became a fiasco even though I had booked 8 months in advance, I was not notified that the airline had changed my flight and my seating was chosen for me, which wasn't acceptable.  Needless to say I decided that I would fly @Delta with the stopover in Atlanta.  I require wheelchair assistance and was absolutely thrilled with the service I received.  The chair was waiting for me upon arrival in Atlanta and as I was changing planes, I was taken by wheelchair to a different area of the airport.  The service was absolutely perfect.  I had an approx. layover of 1.5 hours and this went by quicker than I thought and I was not put out with having to change planes.  My arrival in Melbourne was just as smooth and I am assuming that my return trip back home in April to Toronto with the same stopover will be just as smooth.  The Flight Attendants were very friendly and I will not hesitate to fly with Delta again.  The service I received was excellent and I also saved extra money as @air canada was charging me more for seats because they had downgraded me to their subsidiary company @Rouge which just did not have the right seating arrangements for me.  Air Canada has lost my business and will only be used if it is my one and only choice.

I kept watching her to see if she would occasionally look up - didn't happen.  Once airborne, the cabin gradually warmed up to a reasonable level.

The food was wonderful, the creature comforts delightful, and the service attentive to a fault.  You could take a long nap.  Oh, wait.  That time is today!  Except not on Delta, and not on Delta's flight 2488 between Boston and San Francisco.  Our first-class experience was decidedly second rate, and most certainly not worth the money.  The odd thing is, Delta knows how to deliver that pleasurable experience.  Earlier this year we flew Delta One (nominally Business Class) to London from Boston, and it was perfection.Here's what was wrong:  Pre-flight:  If you have the right kind of credit card, you can have a courtesy entry to the Delta Sky Lounge even though you are flying on a $220 round-trip ticket.  If you are flying Delta One, you have a courtesy entry.  But a first class ticket gets you a polite but firm rebuff.  What sense does that make?Boarding: First class gets you Sky Priority, which is good getting on the plane.  But with the entry portico located back around row 15, getting off means it is ten minutes before you're off the plane.  (Yes, I know that's being picky)The seat: it barely reclined - perhaps 20 degrees, perhaps less.  Yes, it was wider than coach, but by maybe three inches.  The seat pitch was decidedly less than in Delta One.The food: on the way out, a breakfast of some kind of lukewarm spinach quiche, an ice-cold bagel, and mixed fruit.  On the way back, a choice of lukewarm vegetarian lasagna or cold salmon and brussels sprouts.  I passed up both choices and asked for the corned beef sandwich being served in coach.  In short, the food was abysmal.The service:  Considering what the crew had to work with, it was the lone bright spot in an otherwise one-star experience.

And on a rare occasion when I had to change my flight it could not have been easier. As others have noted I also get the early bird check in every time. Sorry the price has gone up but it won't stop me from purchasing. I hope when the issues with the 737 jets are resolved that they will begin offering non stop service to Las Vegas.

Seeing as my flight arrived 2 hours early, I tried to get switched to the earlier flight, and after the United ground staff dealt dealt with the frustratingly lengthy process of rebooking my flight, she was able to land me a seat on the flight and helped me ensure that my bag would be checked in to that flight despite there only being a one hour window to departure. This also meant that I needed to rush to Terminal 1 from the international terminal. Rushing to Terminal 1 is normally easy, seeing as they have that automated people mover, but its undergoing long-term maintenance/being rebuilt in sections, so its closed on weekdays. This meant that I was at the mercy of the shuttle bus, which was obviously slower to board and arrive, due to the very peculiar traffic design between terminals. There was this one intersection that allowed one bus through at a time and took close to 10 minutes to clear. Despite all that rushing, I was still able to get to my flight in time, partly due to their speedy TSA crew that in dealing with the backlog decided thats passengers could go through with their shoes on. My flight back from Minneapolis occurred without a hitch, though arriving with a 3 hour layover gave me a chance to really soak up the architecture and movie filming locations in the 3 main terminals. I probably couldve also tried their dining, but alas, I have not. When it comes to waiting for flights, the seats at Terminal 1 are old, but adequate. I appreciate their provision of outlets near seating for device charging, but it would probably be even better if they also provided USB ports on the outlets, and fitted universal outlets seeing as travellers may not have the correct adaptors. Also, Boingo is still the main WiFi provider in the airport, but they now offer a few hours of unlimited wifi every time you watch an ad. The ads arent that long, so Id argue that thats okay, and for cost recovery, its not too annoying.","{'neg': 0.025, 'neu': 0.891, 'pos': 0.084, 'compound': 0.9732}",0.9732

Think Orlando, Chicago and Miami airport landscaping and signage - all beautifully designed and maintained- not New Orleans - no design talent anywhere outside of the terminal - a waste of a billion dollars! The biggest problem with this 10 week old terminal is that it is filthy - I have been through the airport 4 times since it opened in November and I can attest that the floors have not ben cleaned once since opening. The same stains and dirt piles are on the floors. They have been swept clean by the lazy airport staff, but never washed clean. What a shame after the efforts put into the design and great layout. Atlanta and Detroit airports are all run by similar politically connected vendors- but they are spotlessly clean and beautiful. The New Orleans folks just dont care about being clean - what a shame.

The first leg of our trip was from San Francisco to Atlanta International Airport or ATL. Which by th way is a hub for Delta Airlines. As our plane touched down in the great state of Georgia, all you could see were Delta Jets, they were everywhere. This Airport is outstanding but we leave that for another review. We had a lay over that lasted just over 3 hours. Then we boarded a Delta Boeing 757. Why did I think a 757 was bigger than a 747? The numbers are higher, but the plane was small, lol. Service on board every leg of our trip to and from Aruba was top! The flight attendants all were very polite and professional. But my only issue is that we should have booked first class instead of economy! In economy the seats are way to close together, if your height is north of 5'10 and you have long legs? You need to book 1st Class. Much more leg and elbow room. Just imagine a 6 hour flight and every time you move an inch your bumping up against the passenger seated next to you, don't sit next to the window if you like to drink a lot of soft drinks, because when you have to pee, the whole row needs to get up! I drank water and ate 10 bags of Cheez -it's. 1st Class gets hot food that has been prepared, and yes they eat first! My stomach was growling for a tiny bag of pretzels or cheez-it's.Now i'm addicted to them. haha Hey Airline officials? We are not cattle! I will never fly economy again... it can be brutal,1st Class, unless you don't mind the chair in front of you pressing into your knees for 5-6 hours.","{'neg': 0.013, 'neu': 0.904, 'pos': 0.082, 'compound': 0.9743}",0.9743

The trash bin was overflowing and on our return flight it was even worse.  The seat on the toilet would not stay up while we males were urinating.  This may seem nasty to some people but I can only say you should have been there.  No wonder so much paper was generated.  Probably from attempts to clean the seat.  I know SWA does fast turns but take enough time to clean it please.Second complaint is against there misleading ads.  Yes they don't charge for bags.  I don't pay for them on AA either because I do the credit card deal.  Here is your hidden fee.  My complaint is against the ""Early Bird"" fee.  This is something you have to pay in order to be among the first 60 to board and the farther you are down the list the less it is worth.  If you want to be assured that you will sit with your traveling companion or sit near the front of the bus or be assured of bin space then you have to pay an extra $25 per person per leg.  Note that some people manipulate this by having one person pay the fee and then save a seat for their companion.  We were 29 and 30 outbound and 30 and 31 return.  When we were boarding the plane we were told by some people that they were saving a seat.  Gimmick your fees and people will work to get around them.I made a reference to the ""Bus"" earlier.  I have not been on SWA for some time.  We did it this time because their Saturday morning run from DAL to Fort Lauderdale  supports cruise departures and AA does not have a similar flight.

We looked for some tickets for this trip and found Delta had a straight flight from ATL to Bogota Colombia so we decided to give it a shot we would only have to buy a ticket from Bogota to Medellin in a Colombian airline which in USD comes out way cheaper. Not only was the flight on delta easier but also was more economic than in American Airlines.The flight to Colombia was smooth and service was outstanding.We had some issues and unfortunately couldn’t board our original flight back on Friday 31st so we had to stay in Bogota. Obviously we had to pay the difference to rebook but due to the nature of our issue they waived the rebook fee which is greatly appreciated.

One thing I suggest for travelers with Southwest if you are traveling during a holiday when folks travel with children is paying for “Early Bird Check-in” which ranges from $15.00-25.00. This will allow you to board in the A group before they let folks on with children and the other boarding groups. Better selection of seats since your not assigned one. Also with regular tickets you have to check-in 24 hours before your flight. With “Early Bird” they check your in. The best thing is to get TSA precheck to avoid long lines at airports. It’s $85.00 good for 5 years. Southwest is awesome to fly with and the crews I’ve dealt with are the best. We actually drive from Roanoke, Va area to Raleigh, NC (3 hours) and save several hundred dollars on flights on Southwest versus our choices at Roanoke.

My luggage is bright blue so very obvious and his is a pelican case. my friend of my bag was literally ripped open when I got it back from baggage claim. also we are military I called because he was coming home from deployment and asked if they had any offers for military coming home for families to be there to support their loved one. There wasn't even a second thought any options nothing. She just said no. Way to support our troops right? The last time I flew with Southwest airlines I had called to get a cheaper flight because my mother was very sick. I explained to the gentleman exactly what was going on. When I got to the airport my ticket was nowhere to be found. I ended up having to pay $800 round trip when when I called book The ticket I could have only paid 400. I had to prove to them that I had given them money already and they credited my ticket price but that was all that they were willing to do. They also used to have the best customer service, but not anymore. I have multiple food allergies and put it in the comments on one of my tickets but they were unable to assist. I have to say I will never fly Southwest again. our troops are over there fighting for our country and yes people are still dying but they're going to act like they don't matter.

On a sour note, I was not at all happy with FLL airport.  The Delta section was crammed with people everywhere with little help.  I had a bad back and had to stand in line for over two hours.

I then learned that we have to confer amongst ourselves and line up in the numerical order of our tickets. (There had to be liars in front of me) I still didn't know the depth of this number order.  I was very close to the end of the line and the back of the plane. (hey, it's the safest spot). But on my return flight, a nice gentleman I was chatting with in the waiting area explained that your number goes in the order that you check in for the flight. What? Why didn't anyone tell me this? He said he sets an alarm for 24 hours ahead (which is the earliest you can check in) so that he logs in right away to get that early number. OMG! What a zoo this is... No first class so I don't feel less than anyone or have to pass by those folks who are lounging in their vast space of leg room, but I felt like a bull charging for my dream seat, of course which I never got on any flight.  You only have movie on your own devices. Have to download an app. Part of my flight had zero wifi going and the flight attendant said ""it's just like that sometimes"" The attendants tell lots of corny jokes on the intercom. We did a mock engagement party for a couple who got engaged right before entering the plane. It does concern me.... ya know the whole thing about assigned seats and a flight list in case the plane goes down...Oh well, I made is safely to my destination.

I tend to avoid SFO since it is known for delays (thanks to Karl the Fog) and difficulty in getting into or out of SFO up from/to San Francisco or the South Bay. When I need to be in San Francisco proper, I always fly into Oakland airport and then take BART into the city. It’s simpler, less expensive, and much quicker than SFO. Amenities in the airport aren’t fantastic, but it’s an easy airport to navigate and security lines are never an issue. And the best part, Southwest flies a late evening flight back to LA, so it makes it perfect for day trips up to SF. (Note: if I need to be in the South Bay of the Peninsula, I fly into/out of SJC - which is a fantastic airport.)","{'neg': 0.021, 'neu': 0.822, 'pos': 0.157, 'compound': 0.9769}",0.9769

0.9775,2020-03-01,2020-03-01,10.0,"Airport chaos, airline useless","Grand Cayman has recently finished enlarging Owen Roberts Airport. Instead of using this new facility appropriately, they allow airlines to way, way overbook flights. On our way into the airport two weeks ago, our plane had to circle a half hour, then wait on the tarmac another half hour, we then spent 1 1/2 hours getting through immigration, and another hour to pick up our rental car.Our American Airlines flight out, however, was a complete nightmare. The airport again having way too many flights booked for it to physically handle, our 4 pm departure, which we had been told was out of gate 6, then gate 9, and finally gate 8, was delayed to 6 pm. This meant we, and everyone else on the flight, would miss our connections in Charlotte. I joined the queue of passengers asking for assistance in rebooking, and although I began as the 6th in line, other passengers were brought over and integrated into our queue, which resulted in my standing in the line for 2 hours. The couple in line ahead of me were given some different flight possibilities and were promised a voucher for an overnight stay. When it was my turn, I received about 1/3 of the American Airlines employee’s attention as she also spoke on the phone and to a passenger who had been helped several passengers before me, but returned with more questions. I was brushed off with, this is still your flight to Charlotte, you will get a different connecting flight tomorrow, no, you will NOT get meal or overnight vouchers.Shortly after this, the departure time on the board changed to 8:45 pm. Then at 6pm, it was announced that the flight was boarding, but would be stopping in Miami to change the crew and then fly  to Charlotte.Once we departed at 6:30, we were told that when our aircraft was arriving at Owen Roberts, there was too much air traffic so the pilot was instructed to circle, which he did for two hours and then flew to Jamaica because he needed to refuel. We were stopping in Miami to go through customs and immigration because we could not get to Charlotte before they closed for the night. Our trip through Miami was very confusing and poorly organized. We went though immigration and customs, picked up our checked luggage, pushed it down the hall and dropped it onto conveyor belts then went through TSA again. Once we were back onboard, we were told we would have to wait for refueling before we could depart. Then we had to wait for some “missing” passengers who were not on the flight because they had arranged for different connectors from Miami.We finally arrived at Charlotte at 11:30 pm. We found the baggage carousel but not our luggage. We were told by an airport worker to “just wait”. When I inquired at the American Airlines luggage counter, I was told to wait another 15 minutes and then check back; at which time there was a long queue. This time, my baggage number was actually checked to the computer and I was told the luggage was in Miami, scheduled to fly to DC and then Portland and that I should file a lost baggage claim when I arrived at Portland Maine. By the time we got to a hotel, it was 2am.We received an email with a flight for 7:49 am Sunday.  We got 3 hours sleep and headed back to the airport.Once we got to Portland, we did file a bag claim, and were told that one bag had somehow gotten onto our flight that morning so had arrived with us but the other one had just left Miami. This employee made arrangements to deliver the luggage to our home and also asked if we needed any toiletries. That would have been very welcomed that night before, but no one offered that kind of help in Charlotte.We had a lovely vacation, but now have returned home exhausted and feeling like herded cattle.Enough of my nightmare: my advise, do not fly into or out of Grand Cayman on a Saturday. Do not expect to be treated well by American Airlines. You might do better flying midweek with Cayman Air, because the Caymanians take care of their own.You might do best with another airline and another island.","{'neg': 0.029, 'neu': 0.912, 'pos': 0.06, 'compound': 0.9775}",0.9775

Southwest has one of the best change policies in the airline industry and I was able to use the credit for the trip on a future flight booked within 9 months of the originally purchased flight.My wife and I booked a trip to San Francisco to visit Napa this March using the original credits. The booking process was fast and easy and I was able to complete everything on-line. There was roughly an $80 per passenger additional charge for the new flights but my credits carried over so I only paid the difference.  We fly Delta most of the time and love how Delta does business. It has been several years since I last flew Southwest. I absolutely hate the Southwest seating and boarding policy but it is what it is and I chose the pay the A-List priority boarding for this flight. Paying the extra did make the boarding process a bit easier and helped ensure overhead bin space. But, with the cost of the flight, the priority boarding passes our flight came out roughly $187 more per person than a direct flight to SFO on Delta would have cost. The plane was not clean, areas around the window were dirty and it was apparent this area is not cleaned. There was trash in the seatback pocket left by a previous traveler. I understand Southwest does quick turnarounds but we had the first flight of the day departing at 5:50 AM EST. The steward staff did a good job on a long flight. They made several rounds with drinks and snacks during the flight. Our take-off and landing were smooth and flawless.

On the way to Punta Cana we were not allowed to queue at the front of the plane to use the toilet, on our return we were unable to queue at either end of the plane ‘because of 911’ (direct quote from air stewardess) I have discovered that there IS a rule that says you can’t line up to use the toilet near the cockpit, and there is a U.S. Security directive for international flights returning to the U.S that states that passengers may not congregate in any area of the cabin. There is a clear difference between congregating and queuing for the toilet, & I know that I have ‘hung out’ in the bar on Virgin transatlantic flights without being chased back to my seat!I’ve also stood in a small queue on a recent BA flight to Chicago from London so is this only a US based airline rule?Anyway, I’m used to European airlines insisting that window blinds are raised for take off & landing, not enforced on Southwest, ditto with ‘arm rest down’ & the guy in front of me was in recline mode from we boarded in Punta Cana until we were about to land in Chicago ......... all rules that are enforced in the EU. So apart from that, boarding is by letter & number & mostly works, it is a ‘free for all’ to get a seat, snacks & drinks are free of charge & there is a constant supply of free water on a 4 & 1/2 hour flight (which leads to needing a bathroom!) Crew are pleasant, the seats aren’t particularly comfortable but the company fly 2 bags FOC per person, & allow changes, so flights work out a reasonable choice for travellers.

0.9782,2019-10-16,2019-10-16,1.0,"""asked multiple employees to help and nobody did""","  | I had a flight today from Newark Airport into Detroit. I got to the airport at 8.45 for a flight that was scheduled to depart at 10.05. I had 3 bags, so I knew I needed to check one of the bags. Most airports let me check a bag at the gate. I have done so at Newark before. The TSA Worker stopped me and asked me to show her my boarding pass before I entered the security line as expected. Than she told me that I had 3 bags and therefore had to go downstairs to check one. I than said that I planned on just checking my bag at the gate. She said ""downstairs"". And I said ""wait can't I check it at the gate"". She said I wasn't allowed through until I went downstairs. So I went downstairs. The staff were very unhelpful and the lines were ridiculous. When I finally checked my bag. I went back up to the security line. The same worker as before was trying to tell me I couldn't have 2 bags and had to check the other (which clearly isn't true, your allowed a personal bag and a carry-on bag). They were both small backpacks so its not like they were big. I think she may have been trying to take advantage of the fact that I'm a freshman in college and look like I don't know what I'm doing. I'll give her the benefit of doubt and say maybe it was miscommunication though as she wasn't clear and kept just saying ""check bags downstairs"" and wouldn't really answer my questions. I then was in the security line. The signs said 15-20 minutes. This was at 9.05, so an hour before my departure time. The line was moving pretty slow, so along the way I asked a couple of workers if they could help me since my flight was pretty soon. They said no, which was understandable considering I still had 30 mins until boarding started, and the lines were only ""15-20 minutes"". At about 9.25 (boarding starts at 9.40, ends at 9.50), I was still pretty far back in the line and it was clear the line wasn't moving. I then again asked the original TSA worker to help me as she was right next to me at this point. She said ""I can't do anything about it. If boarding starts in 10 minutes the gate is already closed."" First off that doesn't even make sense. The gate closes after the boarding ends. Anyway I kept on going through the line, and I was pretty close when it was 9.40 (boarding start). However, the line was going very slowly. I got to the point where you put your bags onto the belt at 9.45, 5 minutes before the gate closes. Since there were so many people putting their bags on their, my bags weren't being moved into the moving line. I asked the worker if she could put my bags in quickly since I had a flight to catch. She just stared at me with a blank stare. A kind man and a woman behind me asked me when my flight boards. I explained that the boarding started 5 minutes ago. They both said that it was ridiculous that they had seen me ask multiple employees to help and nobody did. The 2 people in front of me heard the conversation and let me move in front of them to try to make my flight. I got out of security at 9.48 and sprinted to the gate. When I got there at 9.51, there were 0 employees at the gate, and none at the surrounding gates either. I eventually found an employee at a gate 6 away from mine. He was the most helpful employee of the day. He told me to go to customer service and helped me get a new free ticket for a flight 4 hours later. It turns out that the flight left 10 minutes early and they closed boarding early as well. Terrible service.

The restaurants were not your typical Mcdonalds (no McDonalds at IAH anymore though) or Subway restaurants rather they were the specialty, high-quality local restaurants that made it all the more special. There was also a decent amount of shops to choose from though I felt there too many selling the same things: souveniers, neck pillows, and magazines. What really got the kick out of my Terminal C North experience was the seating. They were not your typical airport seats rather they were leather and very cushioned armchairs and in front of you a table with charging ports and an iPad. Yes, an iPad in every seat!

It starts with purchasing tickets. There's none of this BS Extra Super Duper Economy seating, or whatever the other airlines are calling it, where you have to pay extra for EVERYTHING. You get to check 2 bags at no additional charge, which is really handy when we're traveling to one of my daughter's softball tournaments and can't carry on her softball equipment.

Inbound the connections from Domestic to an International can be made in 20 minutes - I have to do it at least twice on Sunday evenings as my flight has been delayed. The signs are clear, the 5A to 5B or 5C shuttle is effcient and never seems crowded. I have access to BA First class or Concorde lounges but have tried other lounges and bars and they all seem good (one in T5 beside the domestic gate lounge is very good at serving rapidly). There are loads of snack type outlets but it doesn't stink of food everywhere. On arrival the e-passport gates and security works very efficiently and I am not sure fast track actually delivers very much. Shopping is very good and I can't fault the terminal cleanliness. Two issues stop it getting a 10/10 - firstly if you are on a remote stand it is a very long bus ride and the buses are not very good, and secondly the have too many slots so if you are on alate out say 21.00-13.00 then you are going to spend a lot of time at the gate or in a queue.","{'neg': 0.026, 'neu': 0.846, 'pos': 0.127, 'compound': 0.979}",0.979

"," Verified Review |  I prefer to use Fort Lauderdale international for my trips over Miami International for a number of reasons, but primarily parking and getting in/out of the airport. I generally do not fly in/out of this airport on international trips as I'll go with an airline that has connections in one of their hubs: typically Atlanta or New York. So I cannot comment on the experience coming through customs at the international terminal. I live in South Florida and they are building a new international terminal, so perhaps the experiences will be improved after that. At peak times it can get very congested and if you're picking up a UBER ride (which has become more popular), the space allotted for them is not large, so that can be a hassle identifying your ride. Communication between you and the driver is key. The terminals I fly through are quite clean (terminals 1 and 2 primarily, and occasionally 30), the security lines can be slow at times, so I always get to the airport 1.5 to 2 hours ahead of my flight. Food selection is OK, and if you're leaving on a late flight, your options may be limited. Parking is pretty good as they have some large parking garages, but if you're parking when it's a holiday or peak travel days, you may be forced to park in one of the remote lots, that's a real hassle. Plan ahead and get there even earlier if that's the case. As for friendliness of staff at the airport, that's pretty much a premium. But despite all of this, I much prefer to fly out of FTL over MIA.","{'neg': 0.035, 'neu': 0.842, 'pos': 0.123, 'compound': 0.9791}",0.9791

Both my husband and I have travelled and flown quite a bit, but this was personally my first time flying through DFW and never, I repeat, never again! I usually fly Southwest because I love them as an airline and have always had great experiences with them, well to save on flights this time I chose American which meant flying out of DFW instead of Dallas Love. Ill try to make this review as short as I can, but no guarantees considering the entire trip was horrible. First: Our flight left at 05.15 which meant boarding around 04.45. We got to the airport around 03.30. We had two children (2 years and 7 months) with us. Pretty sure there was only one counter area open that was checking bags. Thankfully though, we made it through there relatively quickly. Next is security/TSA. They didnt even open their lines until almost 04.00. Okay, not a big deal, we were TSA precheck so still would have plenty of time. Nope. No TSA precheck open. So we had to go into the normal lane which was very long. Again, no big deal, we all have flights and we should be able to get through pretty quick, right? Nope. They had one, I repeat, one person checking IDs for both general and priority lines. One flipping person that was also taking her merry little time and then they had one line open to go through the security and have bags scanned for 2 long lines of people. Holy hell did we all barely move. Around 04.30-04.40 they finally started opening up TSA precheck line. We asked if we could jump to that line since we were TSA precheck. We were literally ignored and they walked by and let another long line of people come up and start through their line. We even had people in front of us asking if they would make their flights on time because they were needing to get to their gates for boarding. And they were ignored. Okay, now lets jump to when we finally got up to go through security (around 04.40 when we needed to be boarding at 04.45): again, its me my husband and our two kids. Took forever to even get us through the scanners. We get through the metal detectors and now we have to wait for our bags and car seat. TSA pulls every one of our bags for a check. Its probably because of the formula and kids snacks. Nope. They wiped everything down and then told us they had to open every single one of our ready to feed formulas to make sure they were actually formula. The formula was still sealed! And if you are at all familiar with RTF formula, once opened it goes to a short expiration date. So all of our formula for the trip now was being moved to a 24-48 hour expiration date assuming our cold packs kept the cooler cold enough, if it didnt, they put all of our formula expiration to 1 hour. Its not like we could find formula around the airport for him if he gets hungry since our formula is no longer good because you had to break all the seals! So here we are getting progressively more and more angry as we are also supposed to be boarding our flight at the other end of the airport. So I take the kids and start heading/running down to our gate while my husband waits for them to finish opening all of our formula up. We literally get to the gate as the last people to board. Never again!","{'neg': 0.065, 'neu': 0.836, 'pos': 0.099, 'compound': 0.9791}",0.9791

I semi-joke that one has to transit through DFW to get to either Heaven or Hell, as one can easily see all walks of life represented in the customers in this airport. Heck, I even saw Trace Adkins (American country music star) standing around one time. But honestly, DFW is a great and frustrating airport simultaneously, I like it, but I neither love nor hate it. Despite its size, the terminals are all very well connected by a very modern tram, and are very modern and clean, yet each terminal feels like it's the size of the City of Fort Worth and often requires much walking once in the terminal. For another catch, the personnel in this airport lean toward the friendly side overall, but you never know if you're going to catch that one airline staff member who just enjoys barking at their customers (I'm looking at you, American Airlines!), or that one TSA officer who can't get over their breakup with their significant other last month. Personnel are either very helpful, or have the worst attitudes, and there isn't a lot of in-between. Aesthetically, this airport provides a beautiful, spacious, ""Texas-sized"" introduction to visitors to Dallas, Fort Worth, Texas, and the USA altogether. However, while signage anywhere you need to go within the terminals and around the airport property is ample, it can still be a chore to finally reach the always-slow baggage claim, then the car rental facility, or light rail (again, because of those long tram rides and long walks to anywhere). Lastly, as this airport is in the Dallas area, there's usually either a pushy nouveau-riche soccer mom or a testosterone-fueled redneck who doesn't travel much, who is impatiently trying to push ahead of other people in the airport, whether to order a burger, check a bag, or get on the plane. Something about Dallas, I tell you.

With Southwest we are allowed two checked bags...imagine that!!Now if all we were going to do is sit in the pool or lay around the hotel, we could have just had a carry-on, but we planned to do some SCUBA diving and there was a loose requirement to ""dress formally"" for the evening meal.  So, the extra bags came in handy. Having the bags also allowed us to return with gifts or other purchased items.Southwest would get maximum stars if their boarding and seating process had reserved seating with seat selection online.  Having to call, go online, or use the SW app to get a number to stand in line for the ""cattle call"" boarding, is not only inconvenient but borders on the ridiculous.  Also, when boarding families with children the policy is to board the ""A"" lines first and maybe even the ""B"" lines.  So, when a family of 5 (2 adults and 3 children) there were no in line seat available so people were giving up their seats to accommodate the family.  And this happened twice on this trip!

Security was a breeze and we were able to get dinner before going to our gateBoarding took forever with all of the zones but we got on eventually got on board and we were at the very back of a 757. The seat itself was comfortable and came with a pillow and blanket. My one complaint is my ife was completely inoperable. We got pushback eventually and got the sweet apu exhaust fumes goin. The aircraft itself was probably in the final days of its life and was very old and run down.Service was great the whole wayTo summarize this is a great airline and I highly recommend them,"{'neg': 0.035, 'neu': 0.81, 'pos': 0.155, 'compound': 0.9796}",0.9796

This is a fantastic airline, they have newer planes, all of their flight attendants have been more than accommodating and are super friendly (it is like you can tell that the company really does a great job of taking care of their employees first and recognizes what they do well), they make you feel like you’re a super guest (no matter what section you are sitting in), they have a user friendly app that is truly all you need in hand when you go through the airport, amazing customer service, and then some. They often arrive early to the destination and they are down to business as far as getting people on and off of planes. Of all of the flights I’ve taken with Delta, maybe two were delayed, but they got me on the next flight both times and it was only 30 minutes later than the original booked one.

We could check bags for free, including a carseat that was well cared for. With a 5 year old, we could board between groups A and B, so I didn't need to stress about checking in exactly 24 hours in advance while on vacation or shelling out extra for A group boarding. We never had trouble getting seats together, and the kids were thrilled that Southwest includes hot chocolate on their beverage menu.Only issue was that our carseat came out at oversized baggage at Denver airport, and it was really unclear where it was since there were two oversize bag areas.

The transaction was smooth and the website was easy to use. I checked in online in the usual time before departure. I had purchased economy lite tickets, so I did not have a checked bag included (I like to fly more simply these days). It was smooth as usual getting through security at McCarran. The gate agents seemed pleasant, and I did not have a need to speak with them for any reason other than to provide them my boarding pass, etc. The plane was clean and the seats were pretty usual for planes these days. I never find the seats comfortable on planes and always have to use a cushion to sit on and generally a neck pillow for head support. The seats pitch and all the seat amenities e.g. sound, USB, etc. were functional. It seemed like a newer plane; however, I'm never really good at telling because many times the airlines do the retro fit thing to make it a bit more modern/clean. This particular flight arrived a little late but there was enough time to connect and make our next segment from AMS to MAD. Although I was mainly speaking about this specific flight from LAS to AMS, all the flights were decent. The flight attendants and gate agents seemed friendly and helpful. Some of the flights were operated by KLM airlines and I truly enjoyed their flight attendants who really seemed friendly (maybe it's the Dutch Touch - LOL) and willing to go the extra mile for passengers from my observation. I'm not a needy passenger, so I rarely interact with flight attendants on most flights unless they're offering food, drink, etc. Overall I have no real complaints but I wish economy food was a bit better but that goes for all airlines. Unless you're going to pay a high price for food or the flights, I don't think this will change much until the world comes together and complains.","{'neg': 0.052, 'neu': 0.809, 'pos': 0.139, 'compound': 0.9798}",0.9798

Don't know the terminal you're going to? Check their website and find your airline's terminal. Queuing times are efficient as they take into account the intense amount of passengers that go through the airport, just not the planes, you'll be waiting 10, maybe 20 minutes waiting to take off, possibly missing a connecting flight.

The cabin crew were mainly miserable on all flights & looked like they didn’t want to be there. On other airlines kids have been given activity packs & the staff interacted with them. On American Airlines they got nothing & no kids meals were available either. I pre ordered a halal meal & vegetarian, both were horrible. The halal meals were all vegetarian, no meat at all. Halal is not vegetarian, it is no pork!! On the flight back to Manchester the inflight entertainment system was not working for the first 2 hours, it finally started working. I flew to Jamaica with holiday firm TUI a few months before this & the service & quality of the flight was much more superior to American Airlines. Even budget airlines such as Ryanair have better staff & service. We won’t be using American again. One positive was the communication.

Checked in and got Pre TSA screened which meant through security in not much time at all. Flight was 4 hours away (the second of 2 BA flights) and flying Club Class so used the BA Lounge. The actual International Departure area after security looked quite small but it didn't have the usual hordes of people aimlessly milling about between the fast food outlets, coffee shops, sports bars and departure gates. Also quite wide so gave an airy uncrowded feel, and had some nice seating areas with tables. Probably would have been pretty dull and boring if we weren't using BA's lounge. It did have a couple of restaurants at the very end of the terminal which actually looked very nice with great views of the runways.

Struggled to provide enough flights, flight times that are reasonably attractive, fares that are good.  They also have trouble staying on time and are delayed more than they used too. They are now more likely to tease potential customers with a good rate, but provide it only once a day at a horrible hour (so common in the industry).  This summer I feel fortunate that both of my flights to the Midwest were on time, including connectors.  The free bags and other perks are a plus. Flight attendants are generally good natured...but seem less jolly and energetic than they were in the 1990-2010 era. Now it sometimes seems forced.

All the storages full? The crew really don’t know how to handle with non-polite people that brings inside more than 2 item, put everything (personal item and bags) inside the storage instead of under their seats. The crew only stay looking as “I don’t know what to do” or “it’s not my problem” until the storages be full even with 60 empty seats. The crew instead of be at entrance saying “welcome. How are you?” They should be spread through the corridor helping people to use only the storages above their seats and guiding to put the personal item under the seat. If someone else is using more than this two places, this person should be have his hand bag checked to learn and not the people that are not even inside the plane. If I payed for a seat I should be able to put my hand bag above it and not other person. It’s totally non-respectful be asked at the plane entrance if I have batteries, jewelry, electronics in my hand bag because it needs suddenly to be checked because there is no more room for it.

Their seats are tight and they seem to fly the older version planes out of Charlotte and the newer ones out of Dallas. I wish I had some better alternatives but like I said they chased all the reasonable or discounted airlines out. I really find it hard to believe the government allowed these mergers, as all it did was raise fares for all. AA stated they need increases in tickets due to fuel prices, I agreed at the time when gas prices were approaching $4.00 per gallon, now it's half that and the flights aren't coming down, they still charge baggage fees, and seat fees, all the while reporting huge profits. If your going to tie your excuses to fuel then start lowering the fares in accordance. They also make sure they fill every seat, and over book, which should be against the law, as with allowing no cancellations with refund, they don't lose money. Prior to them merging with US Air, my average flight was around $260.00, , after the merger it jumped to $525 and hasn't come down, no matter where I go.

He was professional and very kind. Because I did not have any identity, He had to get an Identity questionnaire which took only another 1-2 minutes. I could tell he was extremely busy as his Communication radio was going off, but he took it in stride and actually lowered the volume so he could give me his full attention. He called Washington and after answering a few questions I was able to sign the form and go through security. He guided me through the security process, searched my bags. His biggest challenge was finding a female officer to pat me down. He had to rotate some Male officers around in order to free up the female officer.

My flight was departing at 6:59am on Sunday so I had to get up extremely early (3:45am) to take the Uber from the city to JFK. When I got the the airport in the early, early morning (5:45am) there were already at least 100 people waiting in line to check their bags . . . UGH! To my delight, I was pointed in the direction of the Sky Priority check in which was a totally separate area with its own check in crew and NO LINES! I walked right up to one of the representatives and checked my bag right in. From there I was directed to a short cut to the security line and made it through in a relatively short period of time considering it was the Sunday after Thanksgiving. The best was yet to come. As I boarded my flight and was seated in my first class, Row 3 seat, I experienced my first time in a fully reclining, lay flat seat. It was an odd configuration with only one seat per window and either the seat was on the aisle OR it was next to the window. I had a window seat. Once we took off, the lights were dimmed and I was able to fully recline to a lay flat position. I had the Delta provided blanket and pillow, turned over on my right side and quickly fell asleep. I awoke during breakfast when the lights were turned up and sat up to enjoy a tasty breakfast and a little TV. But not long after the lights were turned down again I was back in the lay flat position and sleeping soundly again. I slept for more than 4 hours of my 5 1/2 hour flight. It was amazing. I NEVER sleep on planes (including red eyes). But this has changed my whole experience with long flights and I will ALWAYS try to find a Delta lay flat seat when I have any cross country travel.

Fortunately, all the flight attendants I came across on our trip to Turks and back on the American flights were friendly, but I do have to say Cora was a breath of fresh air over the 4 hour returning flight to Philadelphia from Turks.  She was very personable and smiled a lot but most of all she was open for a little “chit-chat” when she came down the aisle which made the flight so much more enjoyable.

My son, being extremely honest, would not board because his children did not meet the ages announced for family boarding.  Therefore upon boarding, we were faced with single-seat availability.  My daughter-in-law stood her ground and would not sit until she could be seated with her 8-year-old son. Thank goodness! It did take several minutes for a person to volunteer to move seats.  Our 11-year-old granddaughter, with tears in her eyes, had to sit in a single seat by a window - the other 2 seats in her row were occupied by 2 young adults that ""were madly in love.""  I asked a person in my row to switch with her - window seat for window seat- but the answer was ""No, I'm comfortable here!""  After we were in the air and personal devices could be used, the young adult couple opened their laptop and proceeded to watch a movie that was not appropriate for young children.  I motioned to my granddaughter to try and go to sleep.  I had chosen a seat next to a young mother with an infant.  She struggled through the entire flight and I was happy to assist and reassure her that her daughter's fussiness did not bother me.  Our flight had been delayed - weather issue. Our flight was safe and comfortable. But, families should not be separated no matter the age!   Our grandchildren fly once or twice a year at most.

The seats in Economy were decent. I liked the in-flight entertainment and info system. And the staff were pleasant and accommodating. There are a very limited number of flights across all airlines going in and out of Cozumel daily. Our flight on Delta leaving Cozumel to Atlanta was supposed to leave at 2:50pm. About 45 minutes before then it was announced that there was a maintenance issue and the flight was delayed until 5:00pm. As time went on, the departure time kept getting pushed back further and further. It was finally announced that the plane could not be repaired within a reasonable amount of time and that a replacement plane was being flown from Atlanta to Cozumel specially to pick us up. Due to the long wait, Delta had all us passengers picked up at the Cozumel airport and taken over to an all-inclusive resort for food and free drinks for several hours. We greatly appreciated that as it really helped the wait time go by. Long story short, we did not get into Atlanta until after 1am. Most everyone onboard the flight missed their connecting flights, including me and my party. Delta had staff waiting on us in Atlanta to answer questions and rebooked flights. They paid for everyone who needed it a room at a hotel at the airport since many connecting flights were hours away. They put me and my party up at a new trendy (and I'm sure expensive) hotel at no charge. We opted to take an 11:30am flight on to Nashville then that morning. That gave us plenty of time to get some good rest.In summary, Delta did everything that they could under the circumstances without sacrificing our safety and while also addressing the needs and comfort of it's passengers.

I experienced the same problems at the North Terminal as these posters had observed at the South Terminal! Firstly, on arriving from Basel, I had the luxury of a jet way from the aircraft to the terminal, but then discovered that our gate was practically the furthest from border control. It's quite illuminating and discouraging to see signs telling you how far in metres you had to walk, approximately how many minutes that would take you, and that there would be seats and toilets available to you on your journey! The next event was crossing the apron on the sky-bridge and the horrible rain forest sound effects from the speakers as you did so. What happened to good, old-fashioned silence? Perhaps that's why you need to know that you'll be passing toilets on your expedition from the lawless outer reaches to the relative promise of civilisation after transiting border control! On reaching border control, there was a dense throng of passengers for all methods of entry. It took about 40 minutes to be processed, but I am grateful that the officer who checked my passport was charming and courteous. Signage could be better for the exit and the shuttle to the South terminal as plenty of people asked me for help and this was my first time to Gatwick for many years. On my return, security was reasonably straightforward with minimal wait, but then I was thrust into a glittery floored shopping arcade worthy of Stansted and Manchester and as far as I know, Gatwick is not owned by MAG. Horrible lighting, low ceilings, no easy way through, running the gauntlet of the perfume sprayers. I did buy some chocolate from the World Duty Free after having pointed out that my preferred purchase was out of its sell-by date and when I did buy a couple of smaller bars, I found that WHSmith was offering the same product on a 3 for 2 basis so I had poor value for money. The restaurants (sorry, fast food outlets) were all upstairs and grubby and disappointing. My flight had been delayed so I chose Garfunkel's, and was served by kind folk who allowed me to relax over my meal rather than pushing me out to turn tables. That I was grateful for. I will be passing through Gatwick more frequently in the future than I might have wished, and based on my recent experience, I will have to try to spend as little time there as possible. Even the jet-way to the plane was dirty, and had litter on the floor and stuck to the walls. A poor impression of the UK. Hopefully something will be done about the overall cleanliness once the air-side shopping experience improvements will have been completed.","{'neg': 0.081, 'neu': 0.781, 'pos': 0.138, 'compound': 0.9848}",0.9848

While I appreciate that they do a vital job for the safety of all of us, and they are under a lot of pressure, the security staff at terminal A were rude and unhelpful today. I was told off by one staff member for leaving one item in my pocket, as if I were already under some sort of investigation. It was a clear plastic wallet containing money, which I did not want exposed to public glare. I then found four trays of my belongings piling up at the end of the runners tipping over, being pushed by the following trays, risking my laptop, kindle and phone being sent crashing to the floor. I had to grab them and was left with an empty tray to get rid of, with nowhere to put it, and no staff offering to help. My reaction was to throw it back onto the runners as I felt I had no other choice, and the staff thought I was throwing it at them. I admit my reaction was not the best one, but I felt pushed into a corner by the staff doing nothing to help me and being rather aggressive. When I asked where I could go to sort my things out the answer was ""I dunno, get outta here"". Unhelpful, rude. This contrasts markedly with the courtesy, helpfulness, and friendliness of everybody else we have met in Boston, including strangers. It also contrasts with the attitude of security staff at other airports I have travelled from recently, such as London Heathrow, Arrecife Lanzarote and Gibraltar.

Having said that, these airlines have always treated me well and my experiences with them has been, for the most part, good.  I had heard bad things about Sun Country, but this flight (the first hop of a trip to Italy) was good.  I suggest you opt for the extra $$ seat.  The front of the aircraft was practically empty while the back was packed to the gills.  Probably why the flight was as enjoyable as it was.  KLM picked up the leg between Schiphol and Florence and the air was really squirrely with the plane seemingly tiny.  But, good piloting was accomplished.  Leaving Florence:  always an adventure.  We were, as it usually goes, late.  A lot late.  Air France flew this part of the journey.  The attendents were wonderful and they even moved me to business/first class toward the end of the flight so I could make my connection at DeGaulle.  Bad news was, the directions for transfer were vague and incorrect to some extent.  So I ended up running (I'm old.  It's hard to run.)...  But caught plane and flight was good.  (Air France always has great food.)  My luggage decided they wanted to stay in Paris, however.  I (the human) flew back into USA through Seattle.  Wonderful Customs Entry Point!

I have flown other international airlines, but have always had good experiences with Delta/AF/KLM.

Our return flight had a layover of only one hour at Love Field, but since the plane was on time and the facility is smaller than DFW, the gate was only a couple from where we landed so we had time to spare.

We were able to obtain a pusher for my wife's wheelchair easily. She was friendly for the more than 40 minute wait to go through security. Seems Canadian security decided that only one screening position was required for strollers and wheelchairs. The entire process was glacial, maybe even slower as there were maybe thirty people in line. Each wheelchair, ours provided by the airport, was inspected as if it was an annual maintenance check. The area immediately after passing through the passenger screening check point looked like a demolition derby of strollers and wheelchairs with screeners doing more thorough inspections and passengers trying to collect their bags, belts and shoes from the mass of items packed into a mess.

A few weeks later, I had to change my plans and cancel my ticket. It happen.When I canceled my reservation, I was hit with what I thought was a pretty steep penalty, $200. I believe my only choice for the remainder was a Delta credit of $396.60. I decided to use my credit for a quick trip from LAX to SFO on 8/28/2019, but good luck locating it. Delta does not make it easy.Eventually, I started a customer service chat conversation on Delta's website. I was told I could not use my credit on the LAX – SFO flight because it was more than a year from my reservation. But it wasn’t unless you twist every date to favor Delta.They want it both ways. If the one year started on the date of my reservation of August 2, 2019, I should be able to make a reservation any time before August 2, 2020, and be within their one-year requirement.If the flight date kicks off the one year, I should be able to fly any time before 10/1/2020 and use my credit and be golden.But by telling you that you had to fly within one year of the date that you made the reservation they maximize the chance you will have to surrender your credit. While this may be legal, it’s not ethical. And it’s about as far from customer-centric thinking as I can imagine. The icing on the cake was the chat session I had with customer service (Kenneth was the bots pretend real name) who would not give me Delta’s phone number because he said, they were just going to give me the same answer as he did over chat. Basically, “Kenneth” is trying to say his decision is final. Welcome to either a Kafka novel or the Soviet Union, where low-level bureaucrats make final decisions and deny you your path to appeal.

Connecting passengers are diverted to a separate customs area, and once complete in there, arrive automatically in the connecting gate area, without having to go thru security again or pick up luggage! I understand this is only for Air Canada flights, but what a difference it makes. Because delays are usual these days, connections are often tight and line-ups at customs and security can be daunting with tight time frames. This has made such a difference! It is finally a truly customer-centred response. Yay for Air Canada in instituting this. It also means I do not have to discard my water bottle and buy another one after security. Question: can you please institute this thru Toronto, too? And also going in the other direction - Halifax- Montreal - La Guardia.

We had booked the Aspire Lounge which was lovely and a great start to the journey. On our return, another friendly member of staff met me and took me through baggage reclaim and security. It made my whole flying experience easy, comfortable and thoroughly enjoyable. I had had my doubts about Gatwick Airport but they were thoroughly dispelled.

The lounge has plenty of seating and attractive clean decor.  There is also a buffet area with a salad bar, daily hot soup and a daily grains bowl.  I enjoyed the hot potato soup supplemented with diced chicken pieces from the salad bar for a substantial snack. The flight was operated with an A321 configured 2X2 in domestic First Class.  I had seat 1C which has extra legroom due to there being no seat in front.  However, half of the overhead bin above row 1 on this side is taken up by equipment and not usable.   For a second flight in a row, I boarded to find my seat very dirty with crumbs and even an oily stain on the seat bottom.  The incoming flight had arrived much earlier so the airline certainly had time to clean, but apparently did not do so at all.Flight time was announced preflight by the captain as 4 hours 50 minutes but it ended up being longer as our flight was directed to use the Pacific approach.  We ended up landing about 20 minutes late. Despite the cabin steward in my incoming flight taking noticeable further precautions due to the coronavirus pandemic, the cabin steward on my flight did not seem to take any extra precautions.  In flight service consisted of drinks on boarding and hot lunch served in flight.  The choice was vegetarian pasta and short rib.  I chose the short rib and it was very tender and delicious. The meal was nicely presented served with an appetizer of shrimp on coleslaw and sprial pasta and beans under the short rib.  Ice cream for dessert was offered at the end of lunch. In flight entertainment is by connecting to the wifi and accessing the free movies and TV programs.  There was a good selection of programs and I found the connectcion reliable.  However, you have to use your own device to access the system.  Note that there is no in seat power outlet at my seat so you have to rely on charging up your device prior to the flight.","{'neg': 0.025, 'neu': 0.869, 'pos': 0.106, 'compound': 0.9877}",0.9877

We are fine with the open seating - we just check in right away at 24 hours before departure and we are always able to board in time to get window-middle seats together.  If we didn't do timely check-in we could pay extra to get at the front of the boarding line.  Interesting, the extra cost is less than the extra we paid to select seats before checking in at the airport, the last time we flew American.

Both flights left and arrived  on time and were comfortable.  My only real complaint is that the plane on the flight to Paris was old and the touch-screen on the InFlight entertainment system on the seat in front of me did not work, so the InFlight entertainment was WORTHLESS.  Three different flight attendants apologized and said that they would ""reset"" the system and I believe that they tried, but to no avail.  I eventually came to believe that they already knew that ""resetting"" it wouldn't work but thought that I would give them credit for trying.  So, for that I rate our experience with Delta a notch lower and the InFlight entertainment as poor - whereas it was excellent on the return flight.  The food & beverage both ways was typical  Economy-Class international flight fare. Our return from Paris  on Friday March 13 was most notable because 30 hrs before Pres Trump had announced travel restrictions from Europe (Covid-19) that would start at midnight Friday so making our plane as scheduled was a bigger deal than normal.  The Delta cabin crew did a good job under difficult circumstances on a totally packed plane.  Due to Covid-19, Delta apparently cut way back on recirculating the air in the cabin to bring in much more outside air than normal the entire flight so the cabin was cooler than normal... the crew distributed extra blankets and we appreciated their precution under the circumstances.  Other than some rough air over the Atlantic, the flight was pretty normal, the food and service was typical of other international flights we have taken.  Again, the Delta cabin crew did an admirable job under the circumstances. When we made our reservations we took the very last row in the main cabin  which had only 2 seats including a window in the row (all others had 3) and a bit more room to recline our seats which was nice.Livng in the SE USA Delta is our preferred airline although we flew back from Paris last October on Air France and I loved it - the food & beverage and overall service were terrific on that flight!","{'neg': 0.054, 'neu': 0.821, 'pos': 0.125, 'compound': 0.9881}",0.9881

When we entered Terminal 1 we were shocked to see the security lines running both directions down the center of the terminal. One line had even doubled back on itself. I have never seen such long lines at any airport!

The line was moving very slowly and I became concerned that we might be in the wrong line. I asked a security officer near me if indeed I was headed in the right direction and expressed my concern that we would miss our flight. He said I was in the correct line and asked if I possibly had pre-check. I explained that I did but my parents didn't and that I needed to stay to help them through security and on the flight. He kindly had us follow him to another line where we were able to get through security as our flight was continuing the boarding process.

The objective of our trip was to formally introduce ourselves to Joseph Michael, our new grandson. I suspect the little guy had a premonition of the coming Coronavirus and opted to make his appearance 2 weeks early. We had previously booked our Southwest flight to Denver based on the original due date; fortunately Southwest reservations were fantastic and made it easy it was for us to change our flight plans.  First there were no flight cancellation fees. When we called, a bit frenzied, and explained our need to quickly revise our flight plans, the reservation representative was calm, knowledgeable and very polite.  He immediately said “congratulations, this is great news and I’m going to get you to Denver as quickly as possible so you can meet the new little guy”. Not only did we get to move up our flight; but the new flight was cheaper and we got a credit that we’ll use to fly back for Joey’s 1st Birthday (hopefully sans any pandemic outbreak). As our daughter had a difficult and complicated delivery, it was fortuitous that Joey came early, given the Coronavirus concerns and the potential to strain the Nation’s acute care facilities. Both Joey and his mommy are fine and Mom Mom was a big help to Joey and his parents.  Pop Pop, well not so much.  Concerned that domestic flights might be curtailed, we decided to shorten our planned 3 week stay; despite that the supply of Bushmills was still ample.  While I’m sure that an extended stay by Mom Mom would have been desired, my daughter offered to pay for any increase in fare for my return flight.  Hmn, was there a message there?  Once again, Southwest came through and we got back to Philly with no cancellation fee.

After flying Premium Economy on Singapore Airlines last year(very impressed), I wasn't sure how American would stack up.  I had read several reviews that were for the most part very good.  We sat in the middle section bulkhead row and while I prefer a window seat, this location was great.  The bulkhead on the 777-200 has tons of legroom, enough headroom to fully stand when the overhead bin is closed and the bulkhead seats have actual leg rests vs the foot rest only on the other rows.  You also don't have anyone reclining into your space making it easy to get up and move about.  A minor drawback(very minor) is the IFE system screen unfolds from the seat which reduces set width slightly at the knee area but, the other positives far outweigh this.  The food was quite good.  The only disappointment was the service.  It wasn't bad, just not great.  Anytime I needed a drink or something else, finding a flight attendant was difficult.  It seemed as if they were always in the back somewhere.  This was the biggest difference(there are a few others) between my good experience on American vs wonderful experience on Singapore.

The machine lagged so the process was not complete before the 45 minutes cut off. I proceeded to the front counter and was politely helped by the staff there to check in. the service on the plane was also just as pleasant. However when I got to Houston is where it all began.I was only able to retrieve one of the two luggage. When I tried to inquire about the other, I was told by the representative there that because the luggage was a ""late check"" it may be on the next direct flight which will land in 4 hours. I thanked the person and waited. when the luggage finally came I was appalled at the sight. this particular luggage was a gift from my wife so I treasured it with love. I bought a fabric luggage cover to protect it from scratches which I know is unavoidable with use. what I saw was my sentimental luggage tattered, stripped naked of its cover, with scratches and dents on the top, and a broken top handle.I did not open the luggage but went straight to the baggage claim office to file a report and check the content there.The first question the representative there asked by was ""are you sure the handle was not broken before"". I explained to her this is a gift from my wife and I had a fabric cover on it. now it is naked, dented, and broken. she then ask me again if I was sure the handle was not broken before. I may understand the policy of asking but why ask twice; and completely ignored the fact the luggage is dented and naked. Upon opening the luggage I found the cover inside of the luggage. She then ask if I want repair or replacement. I again repeated how important this luggage is to me and would be delighted if she can repair it. after inquiring with her colleague, she tell me it must be replaced and ask what brand it is. then in the middle of the crowed room exclaimed ""oh your luggage is a no brand name"".not once did I get an apology for the anguish of not knowing where a sentimental treasured item is, the heartbreak of seeing it tattered, the wasted one day of off-work to spend the holiday with my family, and now the humility of the crime of being poor and treasuring a none brand name item that was a gift from a loving wife after saving up one week of paycheck.","{'neg': 0.107, 'neu': 0.72, 'pos': 0.173, 'compound': 0.9891}",0.9891

I flew Southwest for years while I was working and this was third leisure trip on Southwest since retiring.  Plus, we've taken two other airlines since for leisure trips and the costs weren't worth what you get.  Same things as last time: TSA Pre-check, so security at the airports are so much less hassle. Paying for automatic check-in and priority seating on Southwest really really can't be beat.  The other airlines we flew had all sorts of add-ons that really increased the cost without that much of a benefit.  For instance, $60 to check each bag on another airline, which we had to do because one wasn't a carry-on.  And when you're traveling for a week, I can't shove everything I need into a carry on bag; I know my wife can't. And finally the ease of use of the Southwest app on our phones was great.  Boarding passes, and communication on flight status and so on.The less than great aspects remain what I had said before: its still flying on a bus in seats designed for pygmies. But all airplanes are mostly the same anymore, unless you can pay an additional amount for first class.  Seems I can find a better way to spend that kind a money for a two hour flight.  And again, Southwest cabin crews are the friendliest I've encountered. They are helpful, and seem to understand that, if you had your preference, you'd rather have a whole row to yourself, so they seem to care a bit more than other airline crews.So, I recommend Southwest, I prefer Southwest, and I'm sorry it doesn't go everyplace I'd like to go.","{'neg': 0.015, 'neu': 0.848, 'pos': 0.137, 'compound': 0.9891}",0.9891

Once I landed after flying for 5+ hours, I was ready to catch Uber and get to her house before her surgery early the next morning. As I was taking off an outer coat due to the 40 degree warmer weather, I set my purse down. When I gathered my things as the Uber driver came up, I left my purse on the planter. Of course when we got to her house - no purse. My Uber driver was going back to the airport and offered to see if he could locate it when I gratefully appreciated. My daughter went on line to file a lost and found report. We prayed and moments later, a detective  called. They had been trying to locate me for more than 30 minutes. The Security Guard at the airport found my purse and immediately turned it in. When I spoke to the Detective, I thanked him profusely and asked about next steps. He said Lost and Found would contact me the next morning. They did - twice. They confirmed the contents with me and gave me instructions as to how to pick it up. I told them I would come after my daughter's surgery was over and they understood completely. Around 1pm the next day, I went back to the airport and found them - they were already waiting for me. I asked how I could repay them - tips, writing letters of appreciation or what. They said none of that was necessary and asked how my daughter was.

We traveled round trip from Austin to Columbus, OH.  This review is of our 2nd leg on our return to Austin from Nashville.   In addition to the normal great features of their airline (check 2 bags free, good prices, no itinerary change penalties), we watched them show the more serious, important side of the airline.  About a half hour into our flight, just after reaching cruising altitude, we had a serious incident in on our plane where a passenger sitting 2 rows ahead of me passed out.  One of the flight attendants happened to be an RN and went from friendly drink server to a type A director of the effort to make sure this lady was OK.  She cleared the aisle and moved those in her row to other seats, made sure she was breathing and began taking her BP.  She got one of the other flight attendants to hook up a direct communication with medical help on the ground and communicated the lady's status.  Fortunately, she came to and the plane proceeded to Austin uneventfully, but her quick decisive action was commendable. Once the emergency was over she made sure the passenger was comfortable, and stepped back into a provider of drinks and friendly smiles to other travelers without missing a beat.  If I ever have a health incident on a plane I'll be blessed if this flight attendant or one like her is on my flight!","{'neg': 0.027, 'neu': 0.787, 'pos': 0.186, 'compound': 0.9905}",0.9905

Check in process is interesting.,"Coming from Australia we are used to our no frills airlines being exactly that, you want anything, you pay for it. So we were thrilled to discover with Southwest Airlines, that not only do you get a complimentary soft drink, tea or coffee and a snack, BUT you also get free movies to access via their app. This was fantastic and helped the kids pass the hours. The choice of movies and shows was impressive too. So make sure you get download their app before the flight, instructions are provided on how to access it once on board. There was intermittent issues with the wifi in the air which got annoying, but for the most part it worked pretty well.The check in process is also different to what we have experienced previously. There are NO seat allocation. The order in which you check in (online 24 hours beforehand) is the order in which you board, when you board you pick any available seat. We checked in a few minutes after 24 hours before our flight and discovered we were check in group B, # 9-13. This meant that within the first few minutes, others had checked in before us. Group A I think is reserved for special members and those who wish to pay for priority boarding. When we got on, most window and aisle seats were gone, up to about row 25 or 30, so we had no trouble, but we had no more than 10 rows behind us. If you're in group C, expect to have access to middle seats only.When we flew on a later flight and had forgotten to check in immediately it was available we were group B, 34-38 so we were concerned we would not be able to sit with our kids. Fortunately at check in the lady gave us ""extra time"" which allows us to board after group A but before group B, so that was fantastic. If you have a stopover where you stay on the plane, you have the option to move seats if you want to, so depending on where you are this could be a good opportunity to closer to the front and a quicker exit for your next leg.Considering our longest flight with them was 4 hours, the seats were comfortable (3x3 formation), but typically not much room for 3 adults.One of the things we liked with Southwest, is that their prices INCLUDE baggage allowance, which with 5 people with suitcases, this made a big difference to the prices compared to other carriers.Overall, now we know how it all works, we would definitely book with Southwest again.","{'neg': 0.049, 'neu': 0.828, 'pos': 0.123, 'compound': 0.9906}",0.9906

","  | We went on a trip to Orlando and because we couldn't find a fair price for a flight we opted to fly out of Miami. We arrived at midnight so not much to be said about that. Arrival and luggage was ok as was the transportation to the rental cars. On the way back home however, we 'experienced' this airport. The security lines were horrible. Everyone walks around at an immensly slow speed. One person can't be bothered with helping out others. No real info on who needs to go through regular detection gates and who needs to be bodyscanned. Our carry ons were taken apart after being scanned and it took one single security officer about half an hour before he went through our stuff to check. I don't mind that my carry ons need extra screening for whatever reason but please, do it at a decent speed. The security lines were chaotic at best. Once through security I can't say the airport was dirty but the amenities were very limited as was the seating. Once home I also noticed that the TSA cut the security belt around my suitcase open with bolt cutters, even when it had a TSA lock. And they must have had a key since the suitcase as well had a security TSA lock which was correctly opened. I also put a special cloth sleeve around my suitcase to protect it from wear and scratches which I didn't even bother putting back on. When waiting, there is free WiFi but only for 45 minutes. Great when WiFi was a novelty but nowadays simply incomprehensible. Miami Airport is truly on my to-avoid-list of airports now.

I was told purchasing a gift card would extend these miles, and it did not....as a result, I lost a large number of miles.Neither Delta Nor Southwests miles ever expire.........wish I would have never done business with AA.In terms of actual flying experience, all 3 airlines were similar; and prices were similar also.The 1 perk I did like with AA; was they tended to have more flights (multiple flights in a day rather just a few).   but this has changed on my routes.Delta wins in the customer service category (although availability of flights is most limited amongst the airline).     Delta has also provided the best customer service, in general....when there are issues, they have almost always provided the best alternatives.Southwest is also similar.

Delta is not the most sympathetic airline looking to accommodate passengers with disabilities or seat preferences. Their policy for seat requests is for basic economy flights will only be addressed at the gate. By that time if it is a full plane there is no choice. I could go on with more details pertaining to my issues but I have concluded that if you don't fly and pay for first class you can expect a seat where they want to put you like cattle. The Atlanta based airline seems as tho they find amusement in making any connecting flights totally on the other far side of the airport and for a person on crutches and no wheelchair assistance available on my outgoing flight, I barely caught my connection. On both legs of my outgoing flight I had the very back row of the plane, coincidence? I don't think so,who knows but I would like to know how the seating arrangement is figured out when my trip was booked and paid for in June for a December departure. Do they spin the wheel or throw a dart? Thankfully my return flight went better connection wise.

0.991,2019-12-01,2019-12-01,30.0,"Southwest to Hawaii, The good, the bad and the ...","First let me start by saying that I love Southwest Airlines.   They usually make things easy and get you where you need.   There are things that everyone who flies with any frequency with Southwest knows.  First you HAVE you call exactly 24 hours before your flight to get seats unless you want to pay for early check in.   You can change your reservations without a change fee.  Southwest usually had the friendliest flight attendants and big big one especially when going over to Hawaii two FREE pieces of checked luggage.When flying Southwest to Hawaii, all rules go out the door.  First calling 24 hours ahead doesn’t really help you.  If you call 24 hours ahead of the flight and its your only flight that day (no connections) you are up the creek without a paddle.  If you are lucky you will get a low “B” number otherwise you’ll get a high “B” number or a “C” number.  Why is that?   Well if someone is connecting from Denver there 24 hours ahead for their first and second flight is 2 or 3 hours ahead of you.  Someone else in the same time zone as you with a connecting flight like San Diego will have one to two hours ahead of you.   The flights are very full.  Many people pay the $20.00 or so and buy early check-in which automatically checks you in 36 hours ahead.  This to might not work as well as you hope but you can probably be assured that you’ll at least get a B-30 or better position.  There is another problem with seating.  Many passengers buy ONE early check-in or even the more expensive upgrade boarding which you can only purchase at the airport and that is if it’s available.  Upgrade boarding is a boarding position between A 1-15.   They were $40.00 for our flight.  They then board the flight earlier and save seats for the rest of their party.   On our flight back from Maui  my flying partner who paid for early bird check-in and got a “B-4” assignment said that when he got on the plane every aisle seat was save with a backpack or luggage until the last 4 or 5 rows.  You can see that this might be a little aggravating.Make sure you have your electronic toys FULLY charged.  You might also want to consider getting a battery extender.  There are no electrical outlets on the plane (this is not the case with the other legacy carriers).  Entertainment is free and they have a decent choice of movies and TV shows.  Consider buying a sandwich or making them at home before you get on the plane. You might get hungry over 5 hours of flying.  Southwest does give better snacks on the flight to Hawaii but they are snacks.  Mine contained a package of Wheat Thins, a small container of spreadable cheddar cheese, Welch’s fruit gummies and a package of 6 Tic Tacs.   They do come around with a Pepperage Farm cookie later on and pretzels.  There are still free soft drinks and cocktails and beer you can purchase.  The plane is a 737-900.  It’s newer and has a nicer interior then most of the other Southwest planes I’ve been on.  It also is a bit bigger and seats a few more people.  The problem is the seat bottom don’t have a lot of cushion and my bottom got very uncomfortable sitting there after a while.  The trip home it was the same plane but much worse for me.  It started be uncomfortable within an hour. Bottom Line:  The price is right and truth be told I have a companion pass so my partner didn’t have to pay for his flight other then $11.20 for security fees.  I also have enough points to fly free myself.  If that wasn’t the case, I would consider spending the extra money and flying a legacy airline.","{'neg': 0.048, 'neu': 0.839, 'pos': 0.113, 'compound': 0.991}",0.991

YOU have to travel sometimes, does the experience of coming across someone with your attitude make you happy? Of course it doesn't. On Monday evening, all us travellers waiting to have our bags scanned were herded in to an area and made to wait. Huge unnecessary queues. How many x-ray scanners were available? Two. And they would let 4 or 5 people through at a time to the underworked customs staff. And not a smile anywhere. Thankfully I had Priority boarding which meant I could get through relatively quickly (about half an hour). I didn't bother with the priority boarding at the actual gate as the staff were clearly uninterested in this. If I ever have the misfortune of going through JFK again, I will make sure to be there at least 4 hours before the plane leaves. Coming through was relatively easy thanks to the ESTA process but getting shouted at by certain staff was amusing. Again, something to tell you: we love coming to visit but have no intention of wanting to stay in your lovely country illegally. Really, I like where I live. So, Florida next year.

A small travel package in each seat that included sleep mask, ear plugs, one time use tooth paste and small tooth brush (nice touch).  Attendants were all so nice and the plane was clean. In flight entertainment movies good selection with new releases & old to choose from.  Flight was on time & when the plane had to be pulled back to another gate as we landed pilot let’s know exactly what was going on.  I really enjoyed my flight and was pleasantly surprised with Delta.  Would fly them again for sure.","{'neg': 0.015, 'neu': 0.76, 'pos': 0.225, 'compound': 0.9915}",0.9915

Booking back in October for a March flight we were able to get 4 round trip tickets with seat assignments for under $1,700. 1 checked bag each is included for Trans Atlantic travel. We left JFK on Friday morning and Terminal 8 was very empty, check in was a breeze, no line at security. There wasn't even a line at STARBUCKS!!!! we arrived about 2 hours early but could have easily done an hour prior with how quick it was. We got some breakfast at McDonald's. It would gave been nice to grace a Priority Pass Lounge option in Terminal 8. They started boarding at 9:30am for our 10:20 flight which was probably 90% full in economy. We had seats 33A-D which seemed about the same as every other economy seat. Pillow and blanket at every seat, seat back entertainment, and standard economy leg room. Seats felt a little more comfortable than a domestic seat. Winds were in our favor so flight time was only 5:45. Within the first hour of flight they were already out serving the first drink and meal. Beer and wine is complimentary in economy. Meal choice was a chicken, couscous, and veggie entree, or a vegetarian noodle dish. Either served with a cup of salad, roll with butter, cracker with cheese, packaged brownie and small bottle of water. I would have preferred the meal come closer to mid flight as we just had breakfast in the terminal. Meal and cleanup was done by probably 1:30 into the flight. Free entertainment helped the short flight go even quicker. Another drink service came by, and about an hour before landing another small pre made pizza wrap in a box came by. This felt fairly processed and cheap but it's an option if you need to eat before the flight is over. Honestly to me it felt like too much on a 5:45 flight. That's the same length as many Transcons where you only get a snack and 2 drinks. I thin one meal mid flight would have been enough. We got in early to Heathrow, border control was empty. I wasn't able to use the e-gates with small children but we went straight to an agent with no wait. Bags were already on the carousel when we got to it.","{'neg': 0.021, 'neu': 0.863, 'pos': 0.116, 'compound': 0.9916}",0.9916

Children's play areas, art works, big and clean signage - all abound. Free wi-fi, lots of seating, clean toilets. I arrived quite late at night - after midnight. Without checked luggage I was able to exit the airport without any delay. Cabs waited in line outside the terminal - they accept credit cards. On return, I arrived a bit early because of bad weather. Thus, I had time to walk around to explore the airport. I was impressed. Shops carried local Native Canadian art work and there were both fast food and more formal eateries. Like many other Canadian airports, Vancouver also provides pre-clearance immigration and customs entry into the U.S. However, for the flight I was taking, because it left after 10 pm, this service was not available. I was directed to another gate on the other side of the terminal. I ended up doing the immigration and customs at my destination in JFK - as with everyone else on my flight. Security check was similar to the US and was unhurried - at that time I was the only person undergoing a check! Once you are through the security area, you are greeted with numerous shops. A wonderful airport - large floor to ceiling glass panels offer beautiful views. I generated the boarding pass and the lounge pass from a vending machine. I used the Cathay Pacific lounge which is on one floor above. Again, great views. Lounge hours are limited to arrival and departure of the company's flights.

The quality of the airplanes and general service is far superior on Delta. The planes seem newer and better maintained, the flight attendants are friendlier and, best of all, we seem to be earning rewards at a much faster pace. Case in point, we were able to use miles to upgrade to business class on our recent flight from Boston to Heathrow. We were seated in the bulkhead of the business class cabin, which previously has involved exposure to more noise from the galley area. We were slightly concerned about this, as it was an overnight flight and we really wanted to sleep. The cabin crew were so professional and quiet, so we didn't really notice much noise from the galley. This was a Delta One flight so we had the lay flat seats and a retractable privacy wall. The seat was comfortable, the entertainment screen was huge and the meals were delicious. A big perk was that we received a special card right before we landed which we could present at a special expedited customs line. This was a huge help, as it saved a ton of time and hassle having to go through the large regular line.

I did not have much layover time but as my flight was departing from a gate near the Flagship First Lounge, I managed to drop in for a quick visit.  The lounge was not very busy at around 10:20 am, lots of seating and good food offerings in a buffet area.  It was still set for breakfast with a freshly prepared to order omelet station and interesting healthy drinks like tumeric carrot juice.  It was a very nice brief stop in the lounge. My flight to Charlotte boarded on time.  The flight was operated with an A321 configured 2X2 in domestic First class.  During boarding, the captain announced the flight time to be 4 hours and 2 minutes.  We had a considerable delay on pushback as mechanics determinted the plane had too much hydraulic fluid.  We were scheduled for takeoff at 11:37 am but due to the maintenance issues, we ended up pushing back at 12:29 pm, almost an hour late.  We made up a bit of time in flight but still ended up landing late at 7:37 pm rather than the scheduled 7:14 pm.  Lunch was served on board.  I had the salad with cold grilled chicken breast on the side, and a smoked salmon appetizer.  The chicken was pretty dry so not a great meal, but definitely a good satisfying sized meal.  They may have served dessert after lunch but I dozed off and would have missed it. Entertainment on board was by way of free movies and TV programs through the onboard wifi (free to use to access the onboard entertainment) which you view on your own phone, tablet or laptop.  I was able to connect to the wifi and watch the entertainment and thought the selection of movies and TV programs was very good for a domestic flight. The seat was very wide but did not have much recline.  I had seat 1C which is the aisle bulkhead seat with extra legroom.  I managed to nap fairly well in the seat but for a longer flight, the limited recline might be more uncomfortable. Overall, a good flight with good service, though somewhat uninspiring food offering on this particular flight.","{'neg': 0.055, 'neu': 0.789, 'pos': 0.156, 'compound': 0.992}",0.992

Self-service check-in was Okay. Being on a through ticket with Virgin Atlantic, we didn’t have to pay a supplement for checked luggage. We went straight to the gate for a seat but the area soon became chaotic - lots of folks looking for a free upgrade or a change to their allocated seat; others desperate to board early to ensure they could store their hand luggage as they knew space would be tight. We found boarding very confrontational – when our slot was announced, we had to pretty much shove our way through to the front, as the economy crowd wasn’t for moving. Our seats (10 D & E in the first row behind Business Class) had plenty of space and was also a good spot for a quick disembark. Complimentary snacks (fresh fruit, crisps, pretzels, cereal bars, chocolate etc) were served pretty quickly, followed by a complimentary alcoholic, soft and hot drinks run.

This has never happened to us on even a domestic flight.  It was a very cool experience for them.All during the flight our crew was very attentive and did their best to make sure everyone had the items they needed.  Whenever it was meal or snack time, the crew often passed out seconds of extra items (even ice cream and drinks)!  I assume this was due to the decrease in passengers.There were plenty of entertainment options on this flight and overall the food was very good.  We even had Ben and Jerry's ice cream for desert.  Also, our flight attendant, Ibrahim, was very nice to our youngest daughter.  Near the end of the flight they passed out Toblerone candy bars to passengers.

The airport is undergoing extensive refurbishment to bring it into the 21st century and more humanely manage the 32 million passengers that passed through its gates in 2017. As of March 2018, there's still some way to go. Arrival from LGW on a BA flight started off badly as we were kept waiting 30 minutes until we could disembark. This is commonplace, apparently. A touch of amusement was added to the frustration when some new glass doors just inside the terminal refused to accept a key code. Eventually, they did open and one had a chance to see what the new airport is going to look light: light and spacious, but with the usual long walkways to get to customs and baggage collection. Like other US airports, FLL has Automated Passport Control (APC) which gives passengers the good feeling that getting through customs will be much quicker, but which turns out to be just another level of bureacracy and adding yet more mug shots and fingerprints to the database that the US must have on every entrant. The overall process of getting through customs and baggage collection, plus someone to check that the APC had a stamp on it and another to relieve each passenger, added up to just over an hour. That's not that bad, as many reviews report waits of several hours. Once out of terminal 4, it's then a matter of waiting for the complementary shuttle to take one to terminal one where the car rental is also based. In the end, we gave up with the wait and paid $20 each to a man with a minibus who took us there a lot quicker. For the return trip, we used the complementary shuttle and were impressed by the helpfulness of the driver, who actually got out of his seat to help people on and off with their luggage. Check-in for BA Club World was absolutely fine, but the security check process was made over-complicated by staff putting everyone through the 3D body scanner and insisting that everything (tissues and gum included) were removed from pockets - and giving passengers plenty of attitude if those requirements weren't adhered to. Surprisingly, there's no business class lounge in the international terminal, which seems a huge oversight if FLL wishes to attract premium customers. That said, there was a spacious area prior to the gates with plenty of seats (including rocking chairs) overlooking the runway and a number of food and drink concessions. And there was free WiFi. Unfortunately, some of the staff possessed the same attitudinal problem as that encountered going through security. Overall, FLL was better than we'd been led to believe and we'd use it again in preference to Miami.","{'neg': 0.034, 'neu': 0.842, 'pos': 0.124, 'compound': 0.9923}",0.9923

A330 in Delta One was an old plane and did not have the private suites that Delta's new A350's have.  Nevertheless, the lie-flat seat in business class was spacious and comfortable, and offered a good measure of privacy when the seat was reclined since your fellow passengers disappear from your direct view.  Delta provides a Tumi-branded amenity kit; although skimpy on the actual amenities (lotion, socks, pen, eyeshade, toothbrush), the bag was really nice and a keeper.  There's also a set of noise-cancelling headphones, which provided good sound (deep, authoritative bass and reasonable clarity) and moderate noise cancellation.  They are nowhere near the quality of Bose Quietcomforts but OK nonetheless.  Note that they use a two prong plug so you will need an adapter if you want to use your own headphones.Food service started with warm nuts and a glass of wine, followed by a big and appealing appetizer plate consisting of salad, soup, a small piece of beef, and warm bread.  It was generous and excellent, and could almost pass for a meal in itself.  The main course followed; I chose the salmon which was unfortunately overcooked.  It was followed by an ice cream sundae with two huge scoops and your choice of toppings.  I slept through the mid-flight cookie service but pre-landing was served an absolutely delicious pastrami sandwich with cheese, grilled onions and mayo.  One of the best sandwiches I've had in a long time.  In all, service in Delta One on this flight was attentive but not intrusive, with friendly and professional flight attendants.  The ability to lie flat on a long flight is worth the upgrade, and the supersoft pillow and comforter that Delta provides makes sleeping easy.","{'neg': 0.034, 'neu': 0.797, 'pos': 0.169, 'compound': 0.9923}",0.9923

Airports exist to connect travelers to their flights, with an offering of convenient quick-stop amenities for a bite to eat and a beverage of your choice. DTW appears to have been laid out with good intentions, with features like the quick elevated tram and plentiful people movers. Nonetheless, the airport lacks adequate quick-stop amenities that the hurried traveler depends upon. Furthermore, those amenities shut their doors/kiosks well before the final flights have delivered the last weary travelers, leaving them with no option for a snack or drink (other than vending machine). The hiring practices at the airport, particularly the TSA agents and ticket counter personnel, are also marginal. These folks seem to think that being surly is part of their job description. There are exceptions to this blanket statement, of course, and those gems are truly valued. Also, the curbside baggage handlers and Skycaps are typically quite friendly and courteous.

I love this terminal, it is simple, easy and although it does not have the space of Terminal 1 or all of the amenities, it is a breeze. At MSP, Terminal 2 was added as an expansion and it has since been expanded to 14 gates and it is essentially a large hallway with very simple parking and a few restaurants. The terminal is small but that is also it's best appeal, it is so easy to navigate and spend time in. I have been through domestic and international departures and arrivals and it has just been easy, the way it should be. Parking is simple, one of two ramps, Orange or Purple, park your vehicle, walk across the skyway and you are in. If you are on the side with security open, you just walk into security if you do not need to check a bag and you already have your ticket. Once you are through security, find your gate (not that hard, there are only 14 of them) and go get something to eat. The food is good and mostly local to Minneapolis but be aware that the airport's amenities do not open until 5am, the restaurants open later than that. I ran into this problem with an early Sun Country flight to Cancun. Arrival is pretty much just as easy, you'll be in the airport just long enough to get your bags and a cup of coffee and then walk across the skyway and get in your car. Sun Country and Southwest are the primary carriers out of Terminal 2 and there are a few others as well.

0.9928,2019-12-01,2019-12-01,30.0,Uninspired,"I should begin this review by stating that I am a Platinum Medallion frequent flyer who holds similar status on a competing airline. I chose to take this trip with Delta for three reasons: 1. It was the fastest trip to my destination 2. I was interested in the new aircraft and main cabin service 3. I needed the miles to maintain status on the carrier. Let’s hone in on #2. Delta has been promoting their improved level of service in the main cabin for the past few months. I typically fly internationally in business class, but was intrigued by the First Class influenced service service in the main cabin. I ended up purchasing economy comfort seats and looked forward to trying a long haul flight outside of my comfort zone. As the trip approached 30 days until departure, I looked at my seat assignments and noticed that I was in comfort seats for only 4 out of 6 legs of the trip. I called the Platinum line and asked for this to be corrected, but was declined due to the two legs belonging to partner carriers. (This was not disclosed on the purchase page of Delta’s website.) Since this was out of Delta’s capabilities, I asked to just upgrade to business class and pay the difference. Again, the answer was no. As I am hearing this, I had Delta’s website up and was looking at a minimum of 4 open business class seats per leg. I explained this to the Delta agent and her recommendation was to call back in a couple of days and see if the seats open up. I did this for 2 weeks, but continued to get the run-around from Delta. In the end, I never got a straight answer from the airline and sat in the seats that were originally assigned. The long haul economy comfort seats from SEA to ICN were okay. The new A330 Neo was a wonderful aircraft and the amenities were well thought out. The high touch service that Delta promoted fell flat for me. The crew lacked personality and appreciation for the guests on the airplane. The food was decent sans the bubbly plastic flatware. ICN to DPS was fulfilled by Korean Airlines, so I will forego feedback for this flight. DPS to SYD was fulfilled by Virgin Australia. Although and excellent flight, I will forego feedback here as well. SYD to LAX was a Delta 777, which seemed like an older aircraft managed by a tired / crabby flight team. Similar experience as the SEA flight. Elevated service meant a welcome drink a little under an hour into the flight, a touch better food and standard flight attendants who rather be somewhere else. Overall, spending 49 hours in the air with Delta / Delta partners was underwhelming. Adding to the frustrating 3-4 hours spent trying to get seat assignments just made the trip worse. I’d recommend Delta training their flight crews to believe in the product/ service that is being marketed to the travelers. If my experience is similar to others, I think the airline loses credibility and customers as a result.","{'neg': 0.039, 'neu': 0.84, 'pos': 0.121, 'compound': 0.9928}",0.9928

The pillow is to-be expected. Small but does the job. The blanket was thicker and softer than expected which I was very pleased with. The temperature stayed comfortable throughout flights but when sleeping it was a nice comfort to drape over your body. The seats reclined enough, and the legroom was adequate without paying for extra space. Food & Drink: I am a lover of Korean food, so I was delighted that Bibimbap was on the menu. It was good enough. It included gochujung in a small toothpaste looking tube which I thought was funny. There were two other options which didn't sound interesting to me. That being said, I wish there was a picture of the options or a note as to what was available in a magazine or something in the front pocket of your seat. I knew that beer and wine were complementary from doing my previous research on the airline, but it would have been nice to see what else was available. I would have liked (and been happy to pay for) a vodka tonic, but I didn't see any literature of options and didn't care enough to ask. If at any point you were hungry (which I was a couple times) you could press the call button and ask for snacks. They had a sweet-salty snack mix and a cup of ramen noodles. Both of which I enjoyed. Entertainment: Each seat had their own personal touch TV. It had your standard options of tv, movies, games, etc.. I thought the movies were sufficient but was disappointed by the lack of standard American tv shows.

That said, in February we took a family vacation to Arizona — and found ourselves needing a flight home to Boston that was A) Nonstop; B) Not a redeye; and C) Not crushingly expensive. We usually fly Jetblue everywhere, but they only offered a redeye, so my choices were essentially American... and American.So we booked American, and after a great trip in AZ we arrived at Sky Harbor airport ready for what I'd anticipated would be a long and unpleasant flight — esp. given that we'd be seated near the back, and would be among the last to board.Turns out... it was totally fine.  Standing in line to drop off our luggage and check in? Relatively painless, and the agents were friendly and professional. Boarding?  Handled cleanly and without confusion. The seats? Reasonably sized and comfortable. Yeah, we missed the built-in seatback screens of JetBlue, but one quick app upload made it easy to stream video on our phones. (I just wish I'd been smart enough to download a couple of movies before we got to the airport -- my bad!)The flight was smooth and essentially on time, and - miracle of miracles - our bags even came out quickly and efficiently at Logan Airport (which NEVER happens when we fly Jetblue). So all things considered, it was a really good trip. I don't know if we just lucked out or if reviews here tend to skew negative just because it's hard to write a review of a flight that went fine, but... my trepidation, at least in one case, proved unfounded.

This was doubly true as I made the mistake of reading a whole bunch of reviews prior to boarding that made the trip sound epic, especially in coach. The truth is that it was a long, boring flight, but it was very doable, even with one’s spouse and 8 year old child in tow. Delta treats coach passengers pretty humanely on this flight. The seats were fairly comfortable, and by 2019 airplane standards also fairly wide; something more than 18 inches I believe. I’m 5’10 and burly at roughly 220 lbs, and except for my shoulders which are very wide,  I fit quite nicely into the seat. The one thing the seats didn’t do was recline adequately, and after a time in one position it became murderously hard on my tailbone. I rectified this on our return flight by purchasing a cheap but soft pillow at the JNB terminal. This made all the difference and I got a surprisingly good rest on the way home. Meals were also pretty humane; I had a gratis glass of red wine prior to and again after the evening meal which we ordered off a short menu which was presented at our seats about an hour into the flight. The selection of seatback entertainment was adequate for the length of the journey, both going and coming. I used the eyeshades Delta provided and my own noise canceling headphones to create a space quiet enough to doze through long stretches of the flight. For those times when one was awake and felt like moving about the cabin the Delta flight attendants thoughtfully left bottled water and snacks mid plane. When my body told me it was morning I spent some time talking to the flight attendants in the back of the aircraft with a gratis cup of coffee. Both boarding the plane and deplaning went smoothly and surprisingly quickly. We knew we were going to be quite wiped out on arrival in Johannesburg so we paid an escort from Bidvest to help us with our luggage and get us to and through customs. We repaired to the Intercontinental at JNB for a meal and a good nights rest before beginning our safari and tourist itinerary the following day.","{'neg': 0.032, 'neu': 0.832, 'pos': 0.136, 'compound': 0.9935}",0.9935

This was an older plane but was new in terms of the cabin; it had the Delta One business class product.  I was wondering how much I would like this plane having just flown the A350-1000 a few days earlier.  I needn't have worried as the flight was very smooth and the plane in very good condition.  The only issue was a near 3 hour delay due to a mechanical issue with the plane.  I was impressed that the captain told us about the issue as it was engine related and could have freaked out some people, which it did.  One passenger had extreme anxiety and had to get off the plane.  This forced a delay of another 15 minutes while they searched for her bag.  Anyway, once in the air it turned out to be a very good flight.  The seat was comfortable; even more so when the person sitting next to me moved up to the row ahead leaving me alone in ""my"" row!  The IFE was good in terms of selection but a little dated in terms of screen size and airshow options.  Let's talk about the food and service.  First, I was given a menu.  That was a first for me in economy.  The choices were limited but just getting a menu was a plus.  The food was good by economy standards maybe even really good.  The service was also very good.  Hot towels were passed around before the service started and garbage was picked up regularly.  This plane had WiFi and it worked really well.  I was able to get some work done for a few hours.  The only issue I personally experienced was an USB port that wouldn't charge my phone.  This was less of an issue for me since I had the row to myself and just used the other one.  Funny story; when the flight attendant was making the initial welcome on-board announcement, she called the plane a Boeing A330 before quickly correcting herself with Airbus A330. Lol.

I have been diagnosed with severe degenerative disk disease and cannot walk very far at a time. We set out from a domestic terminal at one end of the airport to the international terminal. We had our suitcases in a cart and kept asking employees which way to go. When we reached the end of the building, I asked a group of chatting employees how to reach the international terminal for our flight to Singapore. The female of the group said to go outside and walk about ten minutes and we would be there. She could see my cane, there is no doubt we are elderly and that my husband was pushing a large cart of four suitcases. I asked if that was the only way since it was raining outside and she smiled and said yes. She gave us no indication that there are shuttle buses for travelers so we started walking. It might be 10 minutes for a young person, but it took us at least 30 minutes. Time was not a problem, exhaustion was. We finally made it to the international terminal where there are very few seats...maybe one per 50 passengers. Our airline counter was not yet open so we stood and waited as seats became available. After a couple of hours, I needed to find a restroom which was a very long walk from where we were. No seats and no restrooms. Once we checked in, we were told that it was a very long way to our gate. That was an understatement. Our airline, Singapore Airlines, was the last gate at the farthest end of that terminal. We walked and rested and walked and rested. We were passed up by many carts carrying people. How are you supposed to get a cart? I had asked before we flew if we could get them and was told you just had to happen upon them. We never did, but others sure did. Later I realized that many people waited at the plane upon exiting and the carts were brought to them yet I was told this could not be done for us. The capper to all of this was when we were finally allowed to board, we were taken out into the rain and very strong wind to a bus, from the bus, we climbed stairs onto our plane. I felt like I was back in primitive 1970s Iran. Upon our return, we had a very tight connection and had to get from the international terminal to a domestic terminal. The first employee I saw when we deplaned was a nice man who handed us two orange express connection passes. We took those and rushed for our baggage so we could go thru customs before boarding a domestic flight. We thought those passes would help, but they served no purpose whatsoever. We went to the back of the line just like everyone else. They would have signs directing us to the express connection lines, but they were no faster than regular lines. At least this time I found a kind employee who told us there were shuttle buses we could take to the domestic terminal. That was very helpful, but we rushed as fast as we could and were told there was no way we could make our flight. We will never go thru LAX again. Why no help for disabled travelers? Why do you have to go outside to another terminal? Visit Changi airport in Singapore to see a truly amazing airport. They have lounges you can sleep on, free foot massage machines, clean restrooms, lots of seating, helpful employees and even a nature walk. Even the tiny airport in Dunedin, NZ, is better organized and cleaner than LAX. LAX is crowded, dirty and poorly planned. I consider it the slum of airports and I've seen some pretty pathetic ones in the Middle East.","{'neg': 0.046, 'neu': 0.842, 'pos': 0.111, 'compound': 0.9937}",0.9937

From JFK to Milan and back to JFK the new service featured three courses with choices of appetizers and main and nice ice cream for desert. And the food tasted fresh and nice. I was amazed. I generally find Delta to be the best of the big US carriers overseas. Staff are helpful. This applies mostly to cabin staff and phone help. Really low marks for the phone service when things are busy. The call back offer without losing your place on line DOES NOT work. Mostly never get a call back. The company keeps saving money by cheap shots like no club access in many cities where there are no Delta Clubs even when they have reciprocal club agreements and one is a Delta Club member. Another example is the huge number of miles needed for oversea upgrades.

They have more flights scheduled than they have gates available, which seems to mean that unless you're lucky, you're going to be delayed, coming or going.  Our outbound flight was late departing, and the actual gate assignment not certain till the last minute.  Upon return to Buffalo, we were a good 20 minutes early, on the ground, and a solid 1/2 hour late (to the scheduled time) to actually get onto a gate.  This is a major hassle, especially if you've been flying thru 14 time zones!  This aspect alone costs Delta at least one rating (from Very Good to Average)The Lounge in MSP (no lounges in Buffalo) was excellent and conveniently located for the departure.  MSP can be a BIG airport if you come in at one end and go out the other.  In this trip, I walked it as I need the exercise, and had the time.  On tighter connections, I hop on one of their golf-cart shuttles.MSP to HND is about 12 1/2 hours.  The lay-flat seating in Delta's business class is, I think, well worth the premium.  (and it isn't cheap!).  Excellent cabin service, good food, and I take an Ambien and sleep 8 hours of the 12.  Arriving at Haneda is fairly simple.  A perhaps five minute walk from the gate to the passport clearance line, and since we were lucky and slightly in front of a couple other arriving flights, our lines were not terribly long.  My luggage was coming down the ramp within five minutes of clearing passports.  There is a ""metro"" line from HND terminal to Shinagawa station, I recommend this over a taxi; from Shinagawa you can get anywhere.   Look for the KEIKYU line, you'll need to purchase a PASMO metro-pass card (500Yen I think, for the empty card, put at least 1000 yen on the card after purchase, the fare to Sninagawa is about 480yen).  There is an alternate metro-card, SUICA, useful on the JR lines.  I'm told you can use either card on any of the lines but I did not try, as I have both cards.  Returning to Haneda is again by the Keikyu line, about a 20 minute ride.  Get off at the INTERNATIONAL Terminal.  Delta did not have any open check-in access when I arrived.  It would be NICE of Delta to note the opening time for Check-in when they email you to remind you to check-in on line.  I'd have enjoyed another hour of leisure at my hotel.  By the time the check-in and baggage drop stations were open, at least 100 people were queuing.  Delta uses a common lounge, which was OK.  Nothing special, just OK.  Boarding for the LAX flight was prompt and efficient, and the lay flat bed and ambien had me asleep till we were about 75 minutes out of LAX.  What I especially appreciate about flying Business Class is that I can ask the flight attendant to make sure I'm awake when they start serving breakfast coffee; I need that morning kick after an overnight flight.  Delta's flight attendants are among the BEST in the industry, by the way.Clearing passports and customs in LAX is easy (forget Arlo Gutheie's song) ;). Connecting in LAX was also fairly easy, I needed a good walk anyway, and had plenty of time.   The Delta lounge is always busy, in cycles, as people arrive and depart.LAX - DTW in 1st Class is predictably nice, and the Sky Club in DTW is one of my favorites.   By the time we were boarding for BUF, I was TIRED!  Dead Tired, I put my head back after getting into my seat and thought ""I'll close my eyes till they do the safety announcements"". Next thing I new, we were hearing the Prepare for Landing in Buffalo announcement.

0.9944,2020-02-01,2020-02-01,40.0,As good as any other airline,"On this specific flight I was in business on the 77W from LAX to LHR, which was overall fine.  The plane was showing its age and the crew somewhat less impressive than on other recent flights on the same product.  The seat itself is among the most comfortable anywhere.But this review is more for the airline in general.  American gets a bad wrap because they move more passengers than any other airline, many of whom fly infrequently and are on basic fares with lots of strings attached.  Many of these passengers romanticize about air travel and are surprised to find out that it usually just sucks.  American does little to make their lower-tier customers feel appreciated, but no major airline does except perhaps Southwest, which has enough other drawbacks that I chose to fly American given the choice.  Why do I fly American over any other airline?  They have a complex network and can get you to far more obscure small markets than any other domestic airline, with many more departure and route options.  Work travel will have flying from home in Reno to small markets - Moline, Yuma, Savannah, or internationally - Frankfurt, Paris.  American's network will get me anywhere.The service is usually mediocre.  Comparable to Delta, better than United, worse than Southwest, in my experience.  Sometimes it's awful, sometimes actually surprisingly good.  Averaging over 75 flights/year, I'm usually in MCE or first on domestic flights, usually premium economy on international legs, maybe in business 25% of the time and MCE about the same.  In any cabin, the service is variable but always tolerable and again, comparable to every other product.  For international flights, I find their premium economy to be better than Lufthansa's product and business class far better than what British Airways has on offer.Reliability is good as far as I'm concerned, I get where I need to go.  Most delays are short and for good reason, and they've put me on other airlines to get me to my destination on time (Copa, Lufthansa, United), so I completely disagree they just leave you somewhere with no options.American's AAdvantage loyalty program has worked great for me.  With devaluations by United and Delta, American's mileage program is way better for booking international destinations in premium cabins.  My business travel gets me far more miles than I can use and status that has me in the front of the plane usually for free or a small amount of miles - and I'm still a tier below Executive Platinum.In summary, American is nowhere near as bad as many make it sound - when you compare it to any other viable alternative.  I wish they'd take some notes out of the Delta customer experience playbook, but Delta doesn't serve my city (Reno) well so end of story.  Definitely the best domestic airline given my needs.","{'neg': 0.053, 'neu': 0.799, 'pos': 0.148, 'compound': 0.9944}",0.9944

And being check-in 2 pieces of luggage free, as well as being able to change my plane tickets without any change penalties, and being able to bring a companion for every flight essentially free (since I fly them so much) definitely keeps me loyal! Although this particular flight didn't have them, sometimes I've been lucky and gotten cabin crew who perform a comedy routine for the safety thing at the beginning of the flight. And they are FUNNY!

I was able to stretch my legs and warm up with blankets provided. They greeted us with a Bellini cocktail and had an entire menu planned out, with multiple selections of food and beverages. As I was seated towards the back of the cabin, breakfast was limited and had to settle for the Frittata although I wanted waffles. They were extremely apologetic and offered alternatives, such as extra fruit or sides to accommodate - which was very sweet. The flight attendants were conscious on constantly bringing water or other beverages, such as tea, coffee without being asked. They left a selection of snacks in the centre part of the plane, allowing us in economy to help ourselves. They were polite and patient when ensuring we were seated during turbulence. If we needed to use the washroom at these times, they assisted without hesitation. The activities and screens worked well, had many options from movies, tv shows, music, etc. They also provided complimentary WiFi to send/receive iMessages, which was a lovely bonus (for those wanting to browse internet, email, or social media there is a fee.)

0.9948,2017-12-08,2017-12-08,7.0,"""Overall, it's a decent airport""","  |    SFO is my home airport. I've flown domestically a couple of times out of it, but with the lack of service on domestic airlines, I really don't like flying on US carriers. Thus, my review is a compilation of experiences on both departures and arrivals at SFO over the last six years. My wife and I travel two to three times a year, mostly to Asia to visit her relatives. Most of the TPAC flights we've taken out of SFO have been late night and the security line experience has been quite quick. SFO doesn't use TSA agents. They were allowed to hire contract employees instead and the difference shows, at least in the international security lines. I believe the longest I've taken in a security line is about 15 minutes, and that was for a rare day flight. So departures are typically pretty good. Arrivals have been a different story. We got into the Global Entry system pretty early in the game, back before credit card offers to reimburse the $100 fee were common. We did it after one particularly heinous arrival in which two 380's and a couple of 777's all landed within minutes of each other, coupled with a computer glitch, caused the lines to simply be ridiculous. If you're familiar with the arrivals layout, you know there's a gate way the heck down at the far end of the arrivals hall. That's where the back of the line was. I believe it was 2.5 hours to get through immigration after all was said and done. But even before that, lines were typically about an hour long, even when fewer than the maximum number of flights land simultaneously. Global Entry changed that for us. The last flight we took arrived back in SFO on December 5th at 6.16pm, according to FlightAware. We were in my brother-in-law's car at 6.45 with our baggage. Lounges at SFO are pretty spartan. We have the Priority Pass, and the only lounge that's available in the entire airport, domestic or international, is on the OneWorld (AA) side of international departures. None are in domestic departures. And the international departure area is separated to such an extent that if you go to the OneWorld side and your flight is departing on the Star Alliance side, you have to back out from the secure area and then pass security on the other side. Not a well thought out design. We've also used the United Lounge, and those are pretty universally grim. Signage is good. The food and beverage on the airside, while a little steep (what airport isn't), was pretty decent. While it's possible to get to and from the airport on public transit, I wouldn't recommend it. BART is a pretty poorly run system and security is not exactly their forte, so I would imagine someone with suitcases would be seen as easy pickings. My one experience with the super shuttle was a Zero Dark Thirty ride one morning from our house about 10 miles away. For my wife and I, it was about $20. Overall, it's a decent airport. It won't compare with the Changi's, Incheon's or even Bangkok airports of the world, but it's serviceable and, sadly, it represents one of the better airports in the country.","{'neg': 0.038, 'neu': 0.838, 'pos': 0.124, 'compound': 0.9948}",0.9948

After flying with Delta, I can assure United that I will never be flying with them again, as long as I can avoid it. Delta takes a different approach to customer service, one that centers around giving the customer what they need as well as what they want. What I was most impressed with while flying Delta is how much nicer the planes are than that of United. The interior was very clean, the seats were comfortable (even in economy), and all of our early arrivals happened because we did not have to deal with any mechanical issues (unlike United, which seems to have mechanical issues 24/7). Secondly, the Airbus 319 that we flew from CLE to SLC was equipped with seat-back entertainment that had hundreds of movies, television shows, games, etc. FOR FREE! United, on the other hand, has cut costs by cutting all seat back entertainment from most domestic flights (and by the way, the movie selection on delta was much better). Thirdly, the customer service on Delta was impeccable. All of the crew members on every flight were helpful and delightful, the food and beverage service was frequent and of good quality, and the pilots were always good about updating the passengers and avoiding rough air when possible. I have never written an airline review before without giving one negative about the airline, but there is a first time for everything, which means I can't think of a single thing on Delta that needs improvement as of now. I urge whoever reads this review to give Delta a shot, even if you have status with another airline. Delta is certainly the best airline in the US, and will eventually become one of the best in the world if they continue to satisfy the customer while also having competitive prices.","{'neg': 0.017, 'neu': 0.794, 'pos': 0.189, 'compound': 0.9949}",0.9949

My husband had got it in his head a different departure time and I was busy from work and didn’t look at the flight times. We got there  an hour before the departure but not the recommended three hours for international flights. We were directed ta see a Special ServIces agent at the counter. Thankfully, we were helped by a very experienced friendly agent. I wish I could  remember her name so I can publicly thank her but we were in panic mode. She was training another agent and calmly navigated through the systems and finally found us a flight to Amsterdam, then a connected flight to Paris. We were originally supposed to arrive in Paris the next day in the morning but got there later in the late afternoon. We thought for sure we would be seating apart with these new arrangements but we got seats together. We were so grateful to Delta’s excellent customer service and this very experienced agent!

I love the fact that with SW you can have luggage without paying a ridiculous fee. I always weigh my luggage on a regular digital scale before going to the airport for check-in. I try to approximate the weight around 47-48lbs just in case my scale is off and fortunately its been correct. When I travel you would think I’m going to be out of town for a month. I bring one carry-on & two check- in bags both weighing from 35 to 48 lbs a piece and there’s no worries about paying an extra fee. I always add the early bird option which is an extra fee; I guess it evens out instead of paying for heavier luggage. I can get on the plane faster to choose my seat since there isn’t assigned seating. I always make sure my destinations are coordinated with Southwest so I can always have my luggage and not have worry about fees. The SW team are always friendly I usually luck up on a pilot that have a beautiful sense of humor with kind flight attendants. If there are any plus size passengers and you need just a little more belt to latch in place they have belt extenders....you can ask your flight attendant. They offer water & soda with a snack with each flight. If you want something stronger you’ll have to pay an additional fee. All my friends fly Southwest.

0.9957,2018-08-25,2018-08-25,7.0,"""an abundance of restaurant choices""
","  | I feel like O'Hare gets a bad wrap overall for a few reasons, but some issues are legitimate, and the experience will vary greatly depending on which terminal you go through. For starters I usually fly United, and usually go through Terminal 1 or 2. I don't fly through Terminal 3, and my experience in the International Terminal has only been for one arrival recently. That said, I can break down Terminal's 1 and 2 which are good overall in my view. For starters the main issue with United is connecting flights can take a little while to get around. Terminal 1 is separated into two concourses connected by an underground walkway. In theory you could have a connecting flight on United Express which are mostly located in Terminal 2 despite your regular United flight may land at the C-Gates in Terminal 1. Therefore, you may have to walk from the end of the C-gate to the central area to reach the underground tunnel, go underground the tarmac, pop up at Terminal 1, then go to the end to reach the walkway to Terminal 2, then you'll cross into Terminal 2, and finally you are at your gate. It sounds like a long walk because it is. I recommend at least have 30 minutes to transfer flights. Then the other issues at O'Hare can be queue times for TSA, or some restaurants. I can say from personal experience the TSA at O'Hare have been relatively quick, as in no more than 20 minutes to get through during most times, however, during some peak times such as 4-6 pm, then lines can get long and take over 30 minutes. It has been random since sometimes during ""peak times"" things have been quick. I finally got TSA pre-check, so I'll see how that goes when I fly out tomorrow. Finally the last big issue is the poor wifi. It's Boingo which is too expensive, and at times it doesn't process your purchase correctly. Try to get into a United Club for wifi. I have gone through some personal negatives, and likely negatives for flyers in Terminals 1 and 2. The good news there are pluses. For one, the food choices are good. There are some local chains including Rick Bayless own chain which has solid Tex-Mex sandwiches, and amazing Guacamole. I believe Wow Bao is located in O'Hare, and there is a local tea chain as well. Meanwhile there is an abundance of restaurant choices such as steak, Italian, seafood, cafe food, etc. From my experience I haven't had a bad meal. Keep in mind, don't expect Michelin star restaurants, but if you have a good layover, then you can get a good meal. Finally the bar scene isn't bad, but prices are airport prices. At least Goose island has bars with local tapped beer. Finally the last positive is the location. The blue line connects to O'Hare, 24/7, to the Loop. It's near I-90 and I-294 which help drivers get around anywhere in the Chicagoland area. That said, if you are going to Northwest Indiana, or Joilet, then it'll take a good hour to get there from O'hare. That said, the taxi stand is outdated and slow. Expect to spend a good 30 minutes to get a taxi. Overall it is a good big airport. It's not perfect, nor the best in the world since I've been to LHR to Narita, however, as a large US airport it's one of the better ones in my view. Especially compared to EWR or elsewhere.","{'neg': 0.042, 'neu': 0.822, 'pos': 0.136, 'compound': 0.9957}",0.9957

First, I can check my bags with no extra charge. As an older American, I can no longer hoist a carry-on into the overhead and sadly, the number of folks volunteering to help have diminished over the years. And I don't like to ask. So I simply check my bag and there it is, waiting for me on the other end. Yes, I might have to wait a few minutes at the carousel but that's okay with me. Second, the seats are somewhat larger and more comfortable than other airlines economy class seats. And while many don't like SW's boarding system, I don't mind it at all. It actually lets me find a seat next to someone who is size-appropriate. Because I am small, often larger people choose to sit next to me, believing they'll have extra room. By choosing my own seat, I don't have to wait with bated breath to see who's going to sit next to me. (And if I've scored a good boarding number, I choose an aisle seat so I have a little extra leaning room in case I wind up with someone with ""floppage."" While this does put me in some danger of being whacked with a backpack during boarding, I am vigilant during this process. And an additional hint: if you see someone coming that you'd rather not have as a seat companion, simply cough. Cough loud and hard. I once met another small woman who held a small bottle of cough syrup while she coughed. Well played, ma'am.) And for those of you flummoxed by the letter/number boarding system all I can say is ""Wow!"" Either you don't pay attention at all or are truly dumb. You should have paid more attention in 4th grade. Next, SW employees are cheerful and funny. And SW pilots all sound like Texas good ol' boys when they drawl their greetings. I don't know why, but that's a good voice that commands ease and trust. You fly this plane, cowboy! This is a winning combination to carry me through the hours of an activity that used to be enjoyable and adventurous but is now stressful and anxiety provoking. That, plus the SW creative drink menu. The only time I met a surly SW attendant, was at the gate in Newark some years ago. But I forgave him. It was Newark, after all. I did write to the company, however, and got a nice voucher to use on my next flight. Very much appreciated. So, if SW flies in your neighborhood, give 'em a try.

I was in regular economy class on this flight, so no special treatment, just their new, standard in-flight service.  Once boarding was complete and before take off the flight attendants came through with menus, amenity kits and headphones.  Shortly after take off we were served a welcome cocktail, it was a bellini which was then followed by hot towel service.  The menu had three options on it, one was vegetarian. I, however, had pre-ordered a vegan meal which was very good and different from their usual vegan meal.  Drinks were served before and during and after dinner service.  Another difference I noticed was that we were all given table clothes with our cutlery in it.  This was a nice touch but it was passed out too early, it should have been given right before serving dinner.  Also, instead of the normal airplane food tray, we were given modern designed plates and the choice of food was served on top of that.  After dinner, desert was served.  About an hour prior to landing we were served breakfast.I slept most of the flight but there was a great selection of movies and series available as part of the entertainment studio.  Since I am a T-Mobile customer, I was also able to take advantage of one hour of free WiFi and free messaging throughout the flight.One thing that hasn't changed is the friendliness of the flight crew.Before my flight, I took advantage of my Delta Skymiles Amex discount for access to the new Sky Lounge at JFK terminal 4.

Normally, I would have watched something on the seat back screens, but against my better judgement, I popped my AirPods in so that I could watch something I downloaded on my phone. They’ve never fallen out of my ears before, so why would they now? As I’m getting nice and comfy and pulling my hair back, the left AirPod pops out and I hear a dreaded clicking noise. Right away, I knew it had become victim to my delta one seat. I looked on the floor around me. Put the seat up, put the seat down, and tried my hardest to find it without bothering anyone (since at this point all the cabin lights were dimmed). I accepted my defeat and went to sleep. A couple hours later, I woke up and started looking again really trying not to be obvious about it. Suddenly one of the flight attendants pops up and asks if I lost something. I told him that I lost my left AirPod and it’s definitely in/under the seat. He actually looked upset for me as he went to grab a flashlight. He then proceeds to take the cushion off the seat. He moves the seat up, moves it down, looks under the seat, peaks in the wiring. At this point I told him not to worry about it, that it’s honestly not worth the trouble. Insert another flight attendant asking what’s the matter. He then tells her what happened and she starts to look. I told her she really didn’t need to go through all this trouble. They then proceed to say that they can grab someone to open up the seat further when we arrive. I once again insist that it’s okay, and that it’s really not worth getting other people involved. But oh were they persistent! The male flight attendant walks off to grab something. The female flight attendant looks down into the seat one more time, reaches her hand in and says “is this it?” Hooray! She found it! I thank her and was truly grateful. The male flight attendant returns and I told him that she found the AirPod. He then says “it’s because she’s a woman and she’s got a better eye.” She then returns and says to him “you know I found it because I’m a woman right?” Commence the little giggles. Like I said, every company has it’s problems, but it’s those good employees that make the difference. I just wanted to write something because I was so impressed with their customer service and wished I could thank them again for going that extra “SkyMile.”","{'neg': 0.059, 'neu': 0.766, 'pos': 0.175, 'compound': 0.9959}",0.9959

The Airlines has received a lot of negatives in recent polls about favorite airlines.  But, American really got the job done for my spouse and I on a recently trip from Palm Springs, CA to Lexington, KY.  Three of the planes we were on were new or newer, and very clean.  The fourth plane was a little older and worn, but in good condition.  The flight crews on all the flights were courteous, clear and attentive.  I truly appreciated their professionalism.  Let’s face it, air travel isn’t what it was back in the early 70s, and that’s simply true.  I don’t love to fly, I don’t enjoy airport experiences, I think the modern world is quite ridiculous, so I appreciated even more the care and thought with which we were treated on each leg of our journey.  I’m giving a shout out to American, and letting you know that I’d select your airlines again.  Thank you for working to improve your image, my spouse and I had a direct benefit from your efforts.","{'neg': 0.028, 'neu': 0.684, 'pos': 0.288, 'compound': 0.996}",0.996

I have discovered that I prefer Delta as it is almost always on time and provides frequent updates and information with consistently good service when it is not as is inevitable.  The seats in economy, main, and comfort plus are relatively comfortable but obviously nothing compares to first or business class.  That said, it is significantly better than the comfort of similar class seats on other airlines in my opinion.  Leg room is  never a problem on Delta and that is important to me as I cannot bend one leg more than a few degrees.  My leg does tend to go to sleep but I've found that a leg hammock solves that issue like a charm.  I will be flying the new premium select level on our next trip to Scotland in July and I have faith that it will be worth the slight difference in cost and a great value for the money.  Although, I am still looking forward to the time when I can upgrade to delta one.  :)  Most planes have in seat entertainment unless it is small hopper plane for short distances in which case it doesn't matter as much.  The amount of selections from movies to tv shows to games and the flight tracker keep me mostly distracted from start to finish.  The staff are friendly, polite, and always professional from checkin to departure even in the worst of times.  I have yet to encounter a single rude staff member even when my behavior and anxiety level would have prompted a rude response.  The food is okay.  Nothing wonderful but palatable and mostly enjoyable.  I appreciate that it is served with a smile, frequently, and while it is still warm.  Lastly, and I hope I don't jinx myself here, I have never been afraid on a Delta flight.  We've had a couple bumpy landings but my understanding is that is actually a good sign for landing.  I don't remember why but the plane should bump a little on landing.  That tells me that Delta employs and trains their pilots and staff thoroughly and ensures that those with our lives in their hands are fully capable and quite possibly the best in the air.","{'neg': 0.06, 'neu': 0.741, 'pos': 0.199, 'compound': 0.996}",0.996

You get to check two free bags per person, so pack as much as you want!The flight from Columbus to Orlando is consistently just under two hours. It usually leaves from and arrives at the same few gates at both airports, which makes navigating both easier. Southwest also allows you to track the flight with their free wifi on your phone, so you can see where you are exactly, what speed the plane is flying at, what altitude you are at, how many miles you have traveled, how many more you have to go, etc-- it's a wonderful feature. The flight itself is usually pretty smooth and easy, barring any inclement weather-- only turns a couple of times when leaving and arriving at both airports.

I had plenty of time to take a look at the fine selection of duty-free shops before heading to the boarding gate.  Boarding was efficiently and courteously carried out for an on-time departure.  Delta's Economy Comfort Plus product is outstanding.  For not much more than regular economy class, I received an upgraded, and comfortable, seat with plenty of leg room. After departure, the cabin crew handed out menus detailing the meal choices available and what meal services could be expected, which is a very nice touch. The crew on this flight was highly professional and very friendly. Service began with snacks and a beverage.  I had requested a special diabetic meal.  It was delicious, well prepared, and served nice and hot.  Much better than most airline catering.  Afterward, the crew came around with bottles of water, which is another nice touch.  About 2 hours or so later, the crew served ice cream and packages of Delta's famous cookies.  An hour or so before arrival in Atlanta. a hot snack was served.  In my case it was a delicious vegetarian hot wrap sandwich.  Also, the crew had a basket of snacks and beverages available in the galley throughout the flight.  Delta should be complimented for the quality of their in-flight service on International flights.  Going through Passport Control and Customs in Atlanta was easy and efficient, especially the automated Customs clearance.  My bags were on their way to the connection to Philadelphia. and I was on my way to the departure terminal in just about an hour,  I had time for a snack before boarding the flight to Philadelphia, and this was also an on-time departure.

Somewhere between Calgary and Vancouver, I lost or had my passport stolen and was unable to board my flight to Auckland with my family. The staff were persistent in helping me in my near panicked state to search my bags while the aircraft was being readied for flight. Unable to produce a passport, the staff sympathetically ushered me to a place in the airport where I met a family member. When I returned to the airport the next day after miraculously acquiring a new passport, flight and Visas, the friendly staff of Air New Zealand greeted me with the same warmth and compassion I had experienced the night before. They informed me that I had been bumped up to Business class and was offered access to the VIP lounge in the airport before my flight. Once inside the Lounge and breathing again for the first time in a day, Douglas Siefert, Vancouver Airport Operations Manager came to the lounge to personally greet me and ensure I was aware of the many luxuries including fabulous food and drinks that I was free to take advantage of. When boarding the flight, the staff once again were kind and genuine, having recognized how overwhelmed I had been the night before watching my family depart on the flight which I could not depart on. I just want to say thank you to the team who so kindly helped me. That was my first experience in Business class and what a way to start my vacation! This was a long awaited holiday where my son, wife and their 8 month old were travelling with me to Australia for my other sons graduation from medical school and then onto New Zealand for Christmas. Having lost my husband in the summer of 2018, this was going to be a very special time with my boys and their wives and families. You can imagine how I would have felt when I couldn't board the flight which was the beginning of this vacation! The staff did not know my story yet were kind, helpful and accommodating. This is a story I will tell over and over as their kindness (which seems to be rarer and rarer these days), made such an impact on me and the experience In Business class was like none other. It goes to show that simple acts of kindness will always be appreciated. We dont often know what someone else is going through so in the words of another be kind to each other!

In any case Comfort Plus was a modest upcharge on top of the basic economy class, but WELL WORTH IT!  Why?  First, you get a few extra inches in seat pitch, which matters a LOT to me at 6' 3 inches.  I've had three other international flights in the past year, and the space on Delta's Comfort Plus is a significant plus factor.  [One of those flights -- a miserably cramped seat just BEHIND the exit row....UGH!...was on a prominent international carrier based out of Frankfurt.  SEHR enttäuschend --- a great disappointment!]The entertainment system offered on Delta is top-notch, with dozens of current and older films and TV series loaded on each invidividual seat screen; plus game play if you like....although in fairness, I think these advanced entertainment packages are becoming more standard on int'l flights.Finally, the professional quality of the flight crew to and from Tokyo was first-rate.  We loved the caring, pampering service, and enjoyed the courtesy and conversatoin of the crew.  We can't recall flights that were more comfortable, and dare we say, FUN, than with Delta.

Requesting a special request meal was no problem for Delta either which I had done beforehand and the food was very tasty and substantial. I especially like the special touch they offer of snacks avaliable in the back after the meal service on long haul flights. You had oreos, biscoff biscuits, kind bars, cheeze itz and more.You also had another warm snack and dessert before landing so we felt very well fed and didn't need dinner by the time we got to the hotel.

Now granted things in our world were already changing at a pretty fast pace but we still felt comfortable taking our senior on his spring break trip with his 2 friends.  We used Delta Vacation to book our trip through a travel agent and off we went to Punta Cana on March 13th.  All was well and we were having a lovely time.  By Tuesday, March 17th, things began to change by the minute.  We checked in with our travel agent to ensure that we were still safe to be on our trip and that our flights home were still a go for Saturday.  She was very reassuring and said she'd monitor the situation for us with Delta so we could go on enjoying our trip.  Wednesday was more of the same but all was still going as planned.  By Thursday we were getting nervous as we started to hear rumblings that our resort was going to shut down and the country was going to close the airports.  Again we were reassuered the Delta had us covered and they were assuring all passengers that noone would get left behind.  We were unable to move up our flights as all were full but they again assured us that our flight was a go.  I can't tell you how comforting it was to know that Delta was my airline and we were going to get home ok.  I never doubted their commitment to their customers and was actually really proud to say it was my hometown airlines.  All around us we watched and heard horror stories of airlines cancelling flights with no notice to customers and basically abondoning them to their own devices to get home.  American Airlines  and United Airlines I'm talking about you!   Families traumatized and stressed to the high heavens as they tried to figure out how to get out of the country.  In a lot of cases Delta actually stepped in and took their airlines credits and booked them out on a Delta flight instead.  On Saturday as we flew out of Punta Cana, on time I might add, it was so comforting to get on that familiar plane with a wonderful staff and head home.

What I enjoyed the most was solid inflight entertainment as the plane had great TV, movies, and music options. Additionally, the fact you can drink beer and wine for free all flight was a plus as well as the authentic meals they had prepared for the long haul. Since we were connecting in Korea we were on the DELTA-KOREAN AIR line so the food offering had a Koran twist with a solid bibimbap meal and other delicious Korean foods and also they had tradition American offerings as well.

0.9976,2020-02-01,2020-02-01,10.0,Delta cannot be trusted,"When it comes to choosing an airline, I am sure many would agree with me that the biggest factor in this decision is trust. Trusting the airline to get you to your destination safely. Trusting them to take care of your luggage. Trusting them to provide you with accurate information with anything regarding your travels. I have trusted Delta Airlines for a very long time. I am even a Delta SkyMiles member, as I had planned on being a customer of theirs for a very long time. But I am afraid to say that that trust has reached its demise after today. Today, I flew to Dallas for a business trip that included a golf outing. I was particularly excited about this golf outing, as I had just bought a brand new $300 club that I was very eager to try. However, the club did not come in the mail before I had to ship the rest of my clubs out via a 3rd party service. I immediately called Delta to see if bringing a single golf club onto the plane was possible. I was very doubtful that this would be allowed, but I thought it would be worth making a phone call just to make sure.When I called Delta’s baggage support line, the man who answered the phone told me in complete confidence that it would not be an issue. I even made sure to ask if I would have any trouble getting it through security. He assured me that it would be fine and that I could store the club in the planes closet or just hold it with me in my seat. This information made me very happy and reinforced the high quality of service and excellence that I believed Delta Airlines provided to all their passengers.When I arrived at the airport, I went to check in a bag. While I was at the counter, 3 women were standing there as one of them was checking in my bag. Not one of them noticed the golf club I was carrying and recommended that I checked it in. But why would they? They were probably just as clueless of the rules and regulations as the man I spoke with on the phone. I got to the front of security with 30 minutes until my flight was supposed to leave when one of the officers told me that I was not allowed to bring my club through. I assured him that I spoke with Delta and they said it was ok. It turns out that all sporting equipment must be checked in, no matter how small it may be. I sprinted back to the check in desk to try and check the club in, but it was too late to do so. I even tried to go store it, but the crew was switching shifts and would not be open for another 15 minutes. I did not have 15 minutes. Long story short, I was forced to throw away a brand new $300 golf club because of the false information that I was provided by Deltas clueless support team and the lack of awareness of their check-in team. If I can’t even trust Delta to provide me simple information about the rules and regulations of my travels, how am I supposed to trust them with my safety? It is safe to say that I will never be flying Delta again and I hope that my story will show others that Delta cannot be trusted.","{'neg': 0.039, 'neu': 0.788, 'pos': 0.173, 'compound': 0.9976}",0.9976
0.9977,2020-02-01,2020-02-01,50.0,Highly Recommend,"Over our entire trip we flew with numerous different airline companies and Southwest was the best of the lot. It was not even a one-off lucky trip that we took but we made multiple journey's (6 in total) within the U.S with Southwest.Tickets were always priced at the same amount as competitors, yet Southwest was the only airline offering free checked baggage (2 per person!) meaning for our travels, with a suitcase each, for myself and my partner price-wise this airline was by far the best option. Their app is very useful for check-in and keeping updated on flight status, gate changes etc. Online check-in was a breeze, we never paid for priority-boarding/early-bird; Southwest operate a 'open-seating' policy so the earlier you check-in, the earlier you board and the more choice you have, however on all but one flight we managed to find two seats together despite being lower B group (just ensure you check-in quickly when it opens online 24 hours prior to departure).The seats always looked clean, although having been on two continuing flights (where you remain on board), it was evident that they didn't do too much cleaning between services which could be improved (though hopefully given the virus pandemic they have increased their cleaning standards). Check-in physically at the airports was also simple with the self-serve kiosks, and we didn't once have to wait in a line. Overall, I think 5 out of 6 of our flights departed and arrived almost exactly on time. I had one cancelled flight but this was due to the airport closing as a result of inclement weather, and through the Southwest app I managed to contact a customer representative and still get to my destination later in the day on a different flight once the fog had cleared and the airport was open again. The app is a stand out feature of the airline as despite not having TV's on-board, the app, when connected to their WiFi, allows free access to fantastic in-flight entertainment and even some live TV channels! (Ensure you download the app before departure). Internet browsing itself is $8 for the flight, but  the movies and TV are all completely free and you do not need to actually purchase the WiFi to access them. In addition, they also provide a complimentary drink and snacks on any type of flight i.e. it isn't just restricted to long haul, which we warmly welcomed.Finally, the staff were always friendly and cheerful and happy to assist with any queries. If I return to the U.S I would undoubtedly fly with Southwest again where possible.","{'neg': 0.009, 'neu': 0.822, 'pos': 0.169, 'compound': 0.9977}",0.9977
0.9982,2020-03-01,2020-03-01,40.0,Good flight to start our Caribbean vacation,"American Airlines Flight 2312PHL-SXM9:25 am-2:36 pmBoeing 757-200Our recent flight from Philadelphia to St. Maarten on American Airlines was generally good, with an early arrival and good service from the flight attendants. The only negative was the old Boeing 757-200 aircraft, which was very dated and not the most comfortable.Our flight experience started out a little rocky at the check-in counters at PHL. We don’t typically fly to the Caribbean, so I assumed that the free checked bag benefit from having the AA credit card would apply to this flight. When we tried to check-in at one of the kiosks, it was charging us $30 per bag, so I went over to the ticket counter to inquire about this. The agent was incredibly rude when I asked about the bag fees. Rather than simply explaining that the credit card free check bag benefit only applies to domestic flights, she acted like I was a total idiot in thinking it would also apply to a flight to St. Maarten which, although technically international, largely feels like a domestic flight. We paid the bag fees and were then off to a much better experience on the flight itself.Boarding began right on time, but was relatively disorganized because of the way the gate was set up. Lines built up toward the gate in multiple directions, so while we were in Group 5, we were unable to board with our group because we were stuck in a line that wasn’t moving. While waiting to board, we noticed that this flight attracted a very rowdy group of leisure travelers, many of whom were already drunk while waiting to get on the plane before 9:00 am, even bringing open drinks with them from the airport bar. Since we were also on a leisure trip, I didn’t mind too much, but I’m not used to such a boisterous boarding process. Once we were on the plane, it was also a very excited and talkative atmosphere, with everyone being much more friendly and outgoing than usual, comparing vacation plans and looking forward to the nice weather. It was a festive flight.We had paid to upgrade to Main Cabin Extra (MCE) seats with extra legroom, and the legroom was definitely sufficient. However, as we’ve found on this aircraft before, the seats were very short and uncomfortable. I’m 5’9” and my head was sticking well above the top of the headrest, which wasn’t very comfortable, and it made it feel like the seat was miniature in size. The old 757s also really show their age in the bathrooms, which look absolutely ancient even when they’re somewhat clean.In-flight entertainment consisted of the standard set of movies and tv shows that you could stream through aa.com on your own device, and old monitors hanging in the cabin every few rows showed Frozen 2 and then a bunch of sitcom episodes throughout the flight. The seats also had power outlets between them, which I didn’t even try to use since I find that they often don’t work.The flight attendants were very nice, and we actually ended up with three separate drink services. They started serving drinks soon after takeoff, and had to stop due to turbulence after only having served only a couple rows, which included ours. When they came back to complete drink service later, they ended up starting back at the front of the cabin and repeating our row, and there was even another full drink service after that. We were definitely given plenty of beverages for a 4-hour flight, and I appreciated that the flight attendants encouraged all of us in MCE to take advantage of the free alcohol that comes with MCE seats, a benefit that is often not mentioned or encouraged by the crew. The plane wasn’t overly well stocked with alcohol, however. As an example, they ran out of sparkling wine at our row, the 3rd row of Economy.For food, a choice of Biscoff cookies or pretzels was offered, along with breakfast foods for purchase. Prior to the flight, I had pre-ordered the simple yogurt with berries and granola. The flight attendant who was handling the food purchases did note that I had pre-ordered the yogurt and was saving it for me. The food was fine, although expensive, at almost $10 for a basic small container of Greek yogurt with a handful of berries and granola to put in it. I was entitled to 25% off of this food purchase by using my AA Citi credit card to pay for it.The flight itself was generally uneventful otherwise. It was a little bit turbulent at the beginning, but the captain left the seatbelt sign on for almost the entire rest of the flight when it wasn’t actually needed, which I always find annoying. Although I didn’t pay for wifi on the flight, I was able to use it to keep tabs on our flight status on aa.com, since we also didn’t really get any updates from the flight deck. I was very happy that we ended up arriving in St. Maarten almost 30 minutes early on a beautiful day. It took the ground staff a little while to get the stairs hooked up to the aircraft for us to walk off of the plane onto the tarmac, and the buses they had to take us from the aircraft to the terminal (which was so close that it seemed stupid to have to take a bus) took a little while to load. However, after all of that, we were still nice and early, so it was a good flight to kick off our trip to the Caribbean!","{'neg': 0.033, 'neu': 0.842, 'pos': 0.125, 'compound': 0.9982}",0.9982

If you are a T-Mobile customer, you will be able to use the WiFi for other purposes such as browsing and watching videos. The seat itself was a really comfortable seat and the flight was very clean. The service was great on this leg of this flight. *Second Leg of Flight*This part of the flight was amazing as well because it included the best features of the previous leg plus the entertainment factor. The service was amazing, the cleanliness of the airplane itself was very clean, and the entertainment options were practically endless. The seats were also very comfortable on this part of the flight. In conclusion, if you were to take a flight with Delta, you won't be let down whatsoever. It was an amazing flight and I would gladly recommend this flight to anyone of my family and/or friends.","{'neg': 0.006, 'neu': 0.673, 'pos': 0.321, 'compound': 0.9982}",0.9982
0.9984,2020-01-01,2020-01-01,30.0,Flying on Delta planes were fine but checking in to partner flights was a bit unerving.,"We flew with Delta from LAX to Madrid and Rome and then back to LAX again. Checking in to the Delta flights were fine, but it was a bit complicated when having to check in with partnering flights. About a month ahead of our scheduled flights we went on the Delta website and picked out our seats. Then the day before we left we of course checked in to each flight. For the Delta flights this was fine, but when Delta partnered with another airline it got really complicated. For example on the way home the first flight was partnered with Aitalia. We went to check in online and Delta said we had to use the Aitalia website. When we went to the Aitalia website none of our Delta flight numbers worked. I then called Aitalia and they said they didn't have us in their system. Then I called Delta (from Italy), waited an hour on the phone (because I didn't have a call back number in Italy) to get to a Delta representative. Talking with the Delta representative they gave me a Aitalia confirmation number that I used on the Aitalia website. This allowed me to see my reservation but there was a big red lettered warning on my reservation saying I was going to have to see the front desk. I had a suspicion that the plane was overbooked and they were trying to bump me. So I went 4 hours before my flight (because I was worried) to the Rome airport and spoke to the Aitalia front desk. The issued my family a boarding pass (for FCO to CDG). It was not the seats I had originally reserved, but at least they were together. They didn't tell us the flight was overbooked but I think that is what was going on. Thankfully Aitalia was also able to give us boarding passes for the transfer part of our trip which was Paris to LAX (which were the seats we originally reserved). When we got to Paris they outright told us the flight was overbooked and were asking if they could bump people. They were also doing weird things like making us get into line and checking our passports, even though you literally had to just go through document control to get to that terminal. They also made everyone with roller bags check them in, this did not apply to us because we only had backpacks. I noticed that the Paris to Los Angeles flight was being serviced by 4 different airlines. I think this is why it was overbooked. I understand it is in the airlines best interest to leave with a fully booked plane, but instead of trying to play tricks with people just be honest. Just make an announcement and say we overbooked the flight and offer compensation if someone is willing to be bumped. It is not genuine by making up extra procedures so you can create a ""gotcha"" moment for some unsuspecting traveler. Luckily for me I have traveled enough to see how this game is played, but it shouldn't be that way.On the flight the planes were fine. The Delta planes had an excellent on board entertainment system, power, and usb connections. The meals were good for airplane food. I enjoyed that there was choice of meals and enjoyed the gnocchis the best for one meal. The stewards were very professional and pleasant and did their best to make the flight enjoyable. Legroom was short on the seats, but that is the standard these days and I didn't want to pay for premium economy. On this factor I give Delta the credit, because you get the service you pay. The Aitalia flight was OK, the staff was again very kind. No inflight entertainment but it was a short flight, I was glad though I had my own battery charger with me.","{'neg': 0.023, 'neu': 0.823, 'pos': 0.154, 'compound': 0.9984}",0.9984
