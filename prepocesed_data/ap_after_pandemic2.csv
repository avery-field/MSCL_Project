2020-03-16,2020-03-16,2.0,"""lose flights due to 2 hr long queues""","  |  Embarrassment of an airport, it is mediocre and disorganized. No separate line for connecting flights and arrivals which makes people lose flights due to 2 hr long queues."
2020-03-18,2020-03-18,1.0,"""will avoid as much as possible""","  | Poor airport and security measures. Was in transit coming from New York going to Bucharest. Of course we had to pass security again, even though it was transit and the same terminal. So anything you might have bought back in New York was good to throw out. Luckily for us it was just some bottles of water. But at security, I had a can of Powder spray for the shoes/feet. The can was clearly Powder, measured in grams and was on an outside net pocket of my backpack. The security staff, instead of just taking care of the can, they got everything out of my backpack, every single individual thing, including cosmetics that were actually in the bag on the tray, and put them directly on the incredibly filthy tray (exactly what I tried to avoid touching with my stuff). This was done at a very slow pace. Also my dad had issues with all his bags, instead of going directly to the problem, the staff touched and got everything out of the bag. Hopefully I never have to use this airport ever again, will avoid as much as possible."

2020-03-19,2020-03-19,5.0,"""never look forward to this place"""," |  Concrete monstrosity and mainly a disappointment. Disorderly queues at check-in but fortunately short waiting times for service. Aged TSA infrastructure and again, weak disorderly queues. Really nothing at all interesting in the gate areas and was pleased to join my flight. Baggage came quickly on my return but was pulled over by a clearly bored CBP agent who did a cursory check and sent us on our way - what a waste of time. Can't avoid unfortunately but never look forward to this place."
2020-03-19,2020-03-19,7.0,"""normally quite an easy experience""","  | Use this airport several times a year for visiting family and it's normally quite an easy experience. As I do pre-clearance I arrive as a domestic passenger, and baggage tends to arrive quickly. Good selection of restaurants but can be a little pricey but that's not unusual nowadays. Seems to be improving, and most recently enjoyed a nice musical performance in Terminal A. Impressed."
2020-03-19,2020-03-19,5.0,"""a very grubby space""","  | Meet and greet parking location is nice and convenient but horrendous queues to drop off car keys in the terminal. Drab airport interior and this theme is continued around security processing with low ceilings and generally cramped queuing areas. Paid for fast track so skipped most of the lines, but a very grubby space. Gate areas are slightly better for space and light, but terrible seating choices and average washroom cleanliness. Not an airport to hang around in. On arrival, immigration kiosk queues were modest and baggage was quick. Baggage area toilets similarly weak appearance. Rather confusing system of automatic retrieval for car keys at meet and greet area but staff there to assist."
2020-03-21,2020-03-21,1.0,"""Why isnt this conveyed to people before""","  | At the security desk when checking my bags, they stopped me for my duty free bag which I bought from Mexico, they took a look at it and took out a bottle that I bought that was freshly bought from the duty free store, the lady took my bottle and said I cant test the bottle its not transparent! Firstly, where is this message told to the passengers before buying or carrying, secondly, why is there no alternate method to test something that is not transparent? Instead they gave me two options, either leave my bottle which cost over $120 or pay extra $30 and go through security again (my flight was about to leave). Why isnt this conveyed to people before!? Why do I have to lose the money I paid for something they cant convey prior to me buying? Im really frustrated by this."
2020-03-21,2020-03-21,1.0,"""6ft distance is not honored""","  |  Most personnel has no mask nor gloves and comes really close, not honoring 6ft distance. I m wearing mask and gloves and counter and security is harassing me, i had to go thru security line then back to counter then security line and they openly harassed me, making me wait, not helping, making it difficult, going tru all my stuff and patting me down it took an hour total and i lost my flight. Security is worst because it is without masks and come close to you to pat you down.  I asked they do talking at 6ft distance and then come to pat me and they had no clue what i was talking about. They want to pretend corona doesnt exist. Airport is quite empty but practically nobody wears a mask or gloves and 6ft distance is not honored."
2020-03-22,2020-03-22,6.0,"""overall rating is bad""", | I rode with Spirit and the employee's and customer support was terrible. They had us go through so much more than what we have ever done at security and they had a rude tone. It took them way too long to give us our boarding pass and went through unnecessary precautions at security that we have never done before. This made my morning horrible and my overall rating is bad.
2020-03-23,2020-03-23,2.0,"""This is awful and disrespectful""","  | We are under a pandemic and I am wearing a mask and gloves, respecting 6 ft distance. Workers at security didn't want us to maintain 6 feet and told me they didn't care if we all got sick. one guy called me sick girl and said you decided to fly, you should have stayed home. This is awful and disrespectful. Security needs to be more aware of the part they play in helping keep people safe. Otherwise, they can stay home."
2020-03-24,2020-03-24,1.0,"""Shame on airport management""",  | We arrived at MCO (Orlando Airport) on Mar 18 at 11.00 pm. Airport was fairly empty as expected except apparently a couple of other planes arrived around the same time. Airport security or TSA whomever controls the trams from the gates to the terminal shut down all but 2 tram cars just as 200-250 people were trying to go from gates to the terminal. With all the concern over Covid19 why in the heck would the airport jam all those people into 2 trams. It probably took 2-3 trips back to the terminal to move all the people. We happened to be on the front end of that crowd and once in the tram had no chance to socially distance ourselves from anyone. It was like stuffing sardines into a can. There were 4-6 airport personnel controlling the situation and they all were obvious to any social distancing requirement being imposed for health purposes. It was 11.00 pm which must have been quitting time and they just did what they did every other night when 11.00 pm arrived. Please allow them to understand what is going on in the world today and try to assist in stopping this current virus. If you cannot allow the employees to make better decisions on their own then airport management needs to be in field understanding what is happening in your airport. Shame on airport management.

2020-04-06,2020-04-06,1.0,"""Extremely rude and unhelpful workers"""," |  Extremely rude and unhelpful workers. My parents speak limited English, however written instructions as well as verbal information was given but everyone they came in contact with in reference to getting from the international terminal to domestic were rude. They actually came on a repatriation Flight due to a lockdown in India because of covid-19 through the US government and this airport was the only place it ended from Mumbai. I was hoping to avoid this airport for them but due to the circumstances I couldnt. Sadly, even our beloved Southwest Airlines counter agent who was checking them into their Chicago flight was not nice to them. My exhausted parents eventually made it to Chicago but unfortunately I was compelled to write an honest review of their experience. I hope that during training or pep talks everyone is reminded that kindness doesnt cost anything. Hopefully if we learn anything from this pandemic itll be compassion."
2020-04-10,2020-04-10,10.0,"""it was very open, spacious, and inviting""","  | This airport was one of the best I've been to, most likely my favourite. There was plenty of very beautiful artwork throughout the terminal, and it was very open, spacious, and inviting. There was plenty of seats available, it was very clean, and there was an extensive selection of food and beverage stores in the E gates. The directions were very clear, and all the staff were very friendly and willing to help. The lines at security and customs and immigration were very short. The Wi-Fi there was free and very fast. Overall, this is an excellent airport: it considerably exceeded my expectations, and I would go out of my way to fly through YVR again."
2020-04-15,2020-04-15,1.0,"""Worst airport I have experienced in the USA""", |  Worst airport I have experienced in the USA. Endless mazes to walk through when entering from international. Dirty. Crowded. Staff yelling at people and this was at 6am. Avoid this airport. I saw signs that 1.2 billion was being spent to modernize - will it be enough? Door alarms repeated sounded and many people had to cover their ears. I gave an overall rating of 1 - I did make the connection (barely) and got through the place but it was an unpleasant experience all around.
2020-04-22,2020-04-22,6.0,"""I was expecting more choice of food""","  | The airport is spacious, looks pretty, however for this kind of airport I was expecting more choice of food in terminal 2. Compared with Gatwick, Gatwick is much better. Staff should have better training at check in area. Not family friendly. Its good if you travel alone outside Europe."
2020-04-25,2020-04-25,1.0,"""The worst TSA ever""", |  The worst TSA ever. I was 40 minutes early before doors closing and its took 30 minutes just to get thru the security and when arrived at the door 2 minutes late they wouldn't reopen the door.
2020-04-27,2020-04-27,1.0,"""I miss the old terminal so much""","  | New terminal is the worst case of the ""emperor has no clothes"" ever. Uncomfortable. Poor design. Passengers huddle behind the few available walls to shield themselves from the blinding sunlight flowing in unfiltered through voluminous windows. There is no place to hide. Inadequate seating. I miss the old terminal so much. What a waste of money! And the news media seems to be complicit in this boondoggle. This is not a Mercedes with four flat tyres, this is a Pinto with no tires that has been stripped for parts no one wants."
2020-05-04,2020-05-04,1.0,"""Water vending machines needed"""," |  Water vending machines needed after security.  All stores obviously closed due to COVID. Pass the security only a water fountainis available. Is that hygienic considering the rate at which the virus keeps spreading?  There are 2 vending machines that sell electronics. Please exchange those for a water one! In the meantime, bring an empty bottle of water with you."
2020-05-14,2020-05-14,1.0,"""no safety requirements""","  |  There are no safety requirements in place during this coronavirus pandemic. At least half the people were not  wearing masks - including airport personnel. There was no social distancing, and, the airport was crowded. I thought that flying in mid-May would be safer than waiting till more people flew, especially since I heard that airports and most airlines were requiring masks (if not social distancing). Only in the USA would there be no real safety regulations in place. For shame airport. Alaska Airlines was worse/as bad. They 'boasted' about their safety policy in place but it was a farce. They said masks were required but there was absolutely no enforcement, even when I complained. I hope to never fly through this airport or with this airline again. It would have been a relief if they had followed their words with real actions, but obviously they are afraid of passengers (who I agree must be not quite right to not fly with a mask), and obviously the company policy does not back them up."

You have to take a bus to travel between terminal 1 to terminal 5 which is an International Terminal, may take many hours to pass thru security. It is crazy with a lot of people everywhere. You must prepare ahead, get a good map, direction and know where to go Leave home early and have plenty of time to spare."
2020-05-19,2020-05-19,1.0,"""Lots of people not wearing masks there"""," |  Please enforce the mask requirement! Today, May 18, was supposed to be the first day SEATAC required masks. Lots of people not wearing masks there - even a TSA agent. I will not go through SEATAC until I hear they are enforcing mask requirement. If SEATAC does not require masks, it will hurt Alaska Airlines."

2020-06-10,2020-06-10,1.0,"""a horrible horrible experience"""," |  The worst airport ever. All NYC airport staff generally rank low in terms of attitude and manners. It isnt uncommon to be greeted with a very confrontational service. On this occasion I had booked NYC as a family holiday and left by the end of the week feeling so upset. A woman and man working at security shouted at my and my family completely unnecessarily. They demanded we fold down our pram with my sleeping 1 year old baby in it and then shouted at us to get her out and the to move on immediately whilst other members of staff watched with complete indifference and smiled. It was a horrible horrible experience. They created an unbelievably tense and hostile environment, which the staff almost fed off. It was not the best holiday given an UBER driver demanded $250 after taking us from JFK to our hotel, and the hotel mixed our rooms up (the Maxwell on Lexington Avenue) Leaving 5 of us to share a double room for 5 days. All in all an awful experience made even worse by the airport staff."

I step off the plane in concourse b. I then go through the underground tunnel to connect to Paris CDG. I take the tram and stop at chick-fil-a. The tram is very nice and quiet with lots of room. I stop at the skyclub and it is one of the best I've ever seen. You can walk, take moving walkways, or the tram. The airport is very efficient from connections with seats for everyone. If you want to shop there are stores there too. The McNamara is the only terminal I've been in and that will be the only terminal I will use. If I have the option to connect through here, then I will go for it, because it is seamless, clean, and very efficient."

They took away my 74 year old aunts wheelchair that she needed when she sat down. Not to mention, one of her escorts left her in a corner for an hour or more. The escorts just displayed terrible customer service. The experience was so horrible for my cousin that she had a complete panic attack and had to run from one end to the other for her stuff. I do not recommend this airport to anyone."

Then we were making sure we had the proper stuff out of our bags and we asked to make sure and the guys says ""well if you would listen to what I'm saying you'd know."" Wow. Then another person got mad because our bag wasn't catching on the belt and the lady started yelling at us! If you hate your job so much leave.

I even asked an employee of the airport to enforce the rules and ask a man close to me to put on a mask and she told me it wasnt her job and walked away. I am disgusted with how filthy the airport is. People leave their trash all over and have no respect for others around them. Even the pilots and staff arent wearing masks, really setting a great example for the rest of people. To say Im angry is an understatement."
2020-07-23,2020-07-23,1.0,"""Utterly poor customer service""","  |  Security was absolutely shambolic. Travelling with family/children? Avoid like the plague. Especially security B. Post lockdown levels of passengers yet still a long queue as only one scanner open. By the way, security B is a maze of stairs and hidden lifts. Im travelling alone with a toddler who will not leave my side during security yet its insisted I stand alone in the body scanner. Toddler leaves my side for no more than 5 seconds, and security staff grab her by the wrist and pulls her away from me in the scanner, whilst another coworker fails in his attempts at entertaining/distracting my toddler with a tray. Toddler freaks out with the woman grabbing her by the wrist and ends up getting extremely upset and clinging to my leg and screaming at the top of her lungs. I sternly ask her not to do that as shes hurting and upsetting my already stressed child. She would not have grabbed an adult by the wrist and pulled like she did to my daughter, whilst my daughter panics and cries out for me. I ask if we cant just go through the walk through scanner, and she says no - the rules are that if the body scanner is available I must be scanned in that, and that shes just doing her job. So they finally decide to do a complete search instead. A supervisor turns up to hover but has nothing useful or comforting to say. When I tell her we were forced to go through the body scanner travelling alone with a child, the woman pipes up and says we werent forced to go through it. And says this repeatedly, contradicting me. However, I was certainly not offered a choice!! Meanwhile my daughter is begging and crying for her pacifier which is on the tray going through the bag scanner rolls eyes which Id been asked to send through with the bags because it was bulging in my pocket. She pats me down. Then tells me she also needs to do the same to my daughter (having man handled her earlier). I explain to my daughter whats about to happen (woman tries to tell my daughter shes going to give her a tickle), woman looks to me for approval, and I tell her to just do it quickly and get it over with. A completely unnecessarily stressful experience with zero consideration nor respect for children. Utterly poor customer service."

Its the whole attitude of the staff. They have had it easy for years. Now that crunch time has come they may start to treat people like customers, in a friendly and happy manner. We are going on our holidays. We do not want to be abused by staff from start to finish. Its a dreadful experience. We pay your wages, we are on a hard earned break and you ruin the start of it. Its appalling. As far as the lounges go the staff are a disgrace. You feel lucky to get in any lounge even though you have paid an annual fee. Hope the pandemic causes a mindset change. The only nice people at Manchester are Jet2 staff. What a breath of fresh air to get to the Jet2 gate and the staff are so lovely. What a change."

My boyfriend and I set our backpacks down after having gone through TSA already to go grab a bagel which couldnt have been more than 10 minutes. When we came back to our seats there was a guard standing near our stuff with a dog. We didnt think anything of it and then he approaches my boyfriend to belittle him in front of other people that you cant leave your bag unattended and it makes people unsettled. He went on for about 5 minutes and then told us some other people may be coming to talk to us. All for a backpack ?! What is TSA for if youre still worried about my bag?! Maybe this airports needs to put signs up saying not to leave bags unattended before they belittle their customers for their unwritten rules. Attached is a picture of the dangerous scary backpacks!

The best we could find was Pret et Manger which at least sold wine and you could sit in the unopened Yo Sushi restaurant.

2020-09-23,2020-09-23,1.0,"""I was appalled by the rudeness of the security staff"""," |  I've been flying from Manchester since the mid 80's and always found it the best in my region for the choice of destinations. I lived abroad for a number of years and recently returned to live in the UK. This was my first foreign trip from Manchester in 10 years and I was appalled by the rudeness of the security staff. I'm used to travelling with hand luggage only. Normally I pop my case on, take out my laptop, clear bag with liquids in and place them in a tray. I have it all down to a fine art. Now this time I had to put my laptop in one tray, my liquids in another and my cabin bag in another. My mother also ended up with two trays, so five between two of us. We then had to queue for ages to get through the one and only metal detector in that area and the staff were shouting at everyone to move quickly. At the other end a snotty woman was shouting at people to pick up their trays and take to the packing area. That's all very well when you just have one, but five, seriously. When trying frantically grab things and condense into one tray so I can carry it to the crowded packing are with no space, she's shouting at me saying 'It's not rocket science!' I've never been treated with such rudeness. I then had my case searched because of a tiny pair of fold up nail scissors which have been all over the world with me in 10 years with no issues. Doncaster Sheffield airport is 20 min from me where the staff treat you with respect and I've already booked my next hol from there. You can get to many popular holidays destinations from there and it's clean, modern and friendly. Why would I drive for two hours to be treated like a piece of dirt by people whose wages I'm paying? Just because they work on security they think it gives them carte blanche to be rude and unprofessional. With a lack of passengers due to covid, airlines cutting back on flights and cancelling holidays the staff should be welcoming passengers not driving them away. I can't honestly see Manchester still operating 3 terminals this time next year. Terminal one is also grubby and dated. I used to live in Manchester and loved it but having been back several times in the last year I've experienced nothing but rudeness at both the train stations and now the airport. No wonder I've heard people referring to it as the 'Nasty Northwest' lately. Heathrow must deal with millions more passengers every year and it's much more polite and professional."

After sorting it out, she didn't have the funds to get a new COVID test for entrance into Guatemala, (Guatemala has changed their requirements). Anyway, the agent was very compassionate and spent as much time as needed to explain and help her to understand what she needed. I had inquired if I could help, some things, of course, could not be corrected by me, but this situation. I could help. She just needed money for the test. The American Agent, explained in Spanish to the lady and that I was going to help her with the funds.

2020-10-18,2020-10-18,8.0,"""it was a very straightforward process""","  | First overseas trip of 2020 and surprisingly it was a very straightforward process through Heathrow Terminal 2. We arrived with 3 hours before departure but neednt have worried. Travelling to Warsaw on LO282, our check in was completed online 24 hrs before. The check in area was quiet and we walked straight up to the kiosk to print our luggage tags. After issuing the tags, the kiosk printed paper boarding passes without any prompt - trying to save paper, we had already got our passes on our mobile phones. Would advise airlines to check if passengers need a paper pass at the kiosk. Once our luggage was tagged, we walked straight over to a drop off desk. In the past, there would be a queue, but given our early arrival at the airport, and the drop in passenger numbers this year, queueing wasnt required. Tags scanned and luggage on its way, we joined the queue through security. Only two lanes were open, but the staff were extremely quick in moving passengers through. Before we knew it we were airside. From walking into the terminal to getting through security only took 20 mins. Obviously the main difference this year is the number of travellers going through Heathrow (or any airport for that matter). Airside was much quieter than we have seen, and one can only imagine the loss in revenue for the high end shops that cater to the wealthy passengers. We made do with visiting World Duty Free, then WHSmiths (always need some reading material) followed by a pint at the pub on the upper level. Naturally everyone is wearing masks and observing social distancing. My wife was disappointed that the perfume samples were not available - for me this was a major plus as I would usually have to wait ages for her to try different scents before choosing which to buy. Our flight usually departed from a B gate, but given the low number of flights, we were directed to one of the gates at the main lounge. Arriving back to Terminal 2 a week later was a little bit busier than before. To start off with as we deplaned, we had to show our COVID documentation (completed online 2 days before). Several fellow passengers had not done this so had to stand to one side and do it there and then. Our arrival coincided with a couple of long hauls from the Far East so there was a long queue at passport control. This wasnt helped by only three e-gates being used. Just as I got to the front of the queue, they closed the e-gate! However, a member of staff was very good at getting three lanes down through the 2 remaining e-gates. I wonder how these queues will change once we end the transition period at the end of the year. By the time we got through passport control and walked over to the carousel, the luggage was just being brought out. From exiting the aircraft to leaving the terminal took 50 mins."

Now let me preface this with a large thank you to those working under the circumstances of a pandemic. This is not easy work and I appreciate those who come to work everyday. I understand that many things have changed and are changing to accommodate COVID-19 mandates and regulations. With that being said, I am still a customer and expect a certain standard of customer service.  First we walk in and have already checked in online so no need to go to the kiosks. My father and I walk over to go through TSA. A gentleman asks to see our boarding pass. This aint where they scan the boarding pass by the way. So my father shows him his boarding pass on his phone and the gentleman walks away from us. A few seconds later he walks over to us and in a raised tone asks to see my boarding pass. So my father shows him my boarding pass on his phone. The gentleman proceeds to tell us in a raised and non-neutral tone that why would we think to not to shows the other pass. Okay, I get your point but isnt it unprofessional to speak to people that way. AND you didnt even look at the boarding pass. So we go in line, ignoring the guy still ranting to us and go to scan out boarding passes. The names were switched for our seats and were showing up wrong on the phone and his scanner. Instead of being patient and working with us to see what was wrong, he rolls his eyes and says my computer says something different so I cant let you pass. Again, totally understand that is a rule that you must follow. However, theres no need to roll your eyes because we are just as confused as you. We the. Go through TSA. What an absolute mess. Everything is so backed up by the continue to let people go through. So after you go through the scanner you need to wait in line AGAIN to get your belongings. And by wait in line I mean for 5 minutes. Doesnt seem like a long time but ideally it should take one minute for my belongings to be checked after I have been scanned. There are workers standing around chatting it up instead of helping their coworkers. What kind of team is that? I just dont understand what kind of place would allow their workers to speak to customers in those tones. Now, its not like we raised our voices first. Im all for customer service employees to stand up for themselves when being disrespected. No one should have to put up with that. However, we never raised our voices or put blame onto the workers yet we were disrespected because? Dont forget those workers who are doing their job. Especially with a pandemic, theres no reason for extra people to just be standing around. You are increasing their risk and the risk of others. This is just unacceptable behavior."

What was more distressing was that at the sitting area at the gates there was no signage as to be 6ft apart or the seats with the signage to be 6ft apart. Some travelers did not have their mask on or did not have their mask on properly - meaning over mouth and nose. It did not look like security was reminding people to social distance.

One employee snatched it out of my hand to call and see when someone would get me to take me to gate. The purpose of a wheelchair service is so I did not have to walk around everywhere yet I had to anyway to get help. Finally a nice woman arrived, stopped to let me get water and took me all the way on the ramp into the plane. She was kind to me and very apologetic, the only person that was. There was no wi-fi and the place is filthy. I do not think a nonstop flight was worth the nightmare I endured with rude indifferent employees. On that note they could learn from the considerate employees and the cleanliness of the South Carolina airport. Upon returning today, Dec 3, yet another rude employee when I got off the plane she was there with a wheelchair but couldn't sit in it due to other passengers waiting for luggage. Walked the ramp myself then she wheeled me to baggage only after I insisted. She did not speak, just looked at her nails.

In my past experience, the lounges here are lame compared with those in the United areas, which I could not use since there is no way to get through without leaving security. ORD should organize the Star Alliance carriers to depart from the terminals United uses since international connections are common, it would save all kinds of difficulty for travelers.

The RDA train to the city is super convenient, but the escalator to get down to it had a closed sign blocking it with no alt offered - eventually found an elevator to take me down. Departing was a nightmare. Getting off train, no easy signs for where check in is, but it dumps you at United, which had lines out the wazoo for everything. Security was snaked for miles and miles. I would hate this airport in particular if I was flying United - on what should be a light day of travel, long lines for everything, most not distanced. I actually had to stop and look up where Southwest check in was on my phone - never have I been unable to navigate an airport based on signage alone. TSA was a nightmare. The north security has shorter lines but I, like many others in front of me, had bags pulled for extra screening. I waited an additional 20 minutes for this check, bunched together with others. They had to check the pockets of my backpack, which were filled with coins and other random junk and has passed through TSA screening at least 10 times with everything in it with no extra search needed. I then darted off to the train to get to the gate and, not being familiar and with no signing, I accidentally got off at the A gates because A51 was prominently called out on my boarding pass - but actually gate was C42, that was just my boarding position. Absolutely no signage or announcement about airlines are at what terminals and every terminal looks exactly the same. I barely made the flight - I was the last passenger on.

I've been to many other airports and their security often makes you feel rushed they are moving you through so quickly and efficiently. Denver Airport security was molasses slow. Lots of standing around waiting for your bin to enter the scan device and then waiting again on the other side of the body scan for your bin to complete its scan. So slow! After I went through the whole process I saw 2 main items that would help speed up the process at Denver Airport: 1) Automated return of security bins. Security checkpoints at other airports have automated bin returns which really speed things up. At the faster airports there is a worker feeding them into an automated bin return and they are quickly made available at the start of the line. Denver Airport had workers using very inefficient carts with bad mobility. My daughter and I couldn't help chuckling at a worker that was slowly navigating a cart with a stack of bins bumping into doors and other items as she struggled to slowly steer the cart from the end of the line back to the start. 2) Have travelers separate out items into different bins with no layers for security scan. Security checkpoints at other airports have you place your electronics in separate bins with now layer/piling of items on top of each other. For example, in Seattle they have you remove your laptop(s) from your bag. Same for your cell phone and bags of liquids. At Denver Airport they had everyone place everything in one tray each all piled on top of each other. Goo grief! No wonder the guy looking at the scanner had to stare at the screen for ages! It took forever. Extremely inefficient and slow for no good reason. Whomever is in charge of security at Denver Airport should take a trip to some other airports and pick up some efficiency improvement ideas. It would go a long way in getting travelers through their security area more quickly. The would also likely need fewer security stations, less equipment and fewer security workers. Aside from the slowness and inefficiency at security, the rest of the experience was fine. There was some construction, but it didn't disrupt our ability to get from point A to point B."

They kept you in the airport for as long as possible. 1 restaurant that sits probably 30 people, 2 stores that were poorly stocked with disgusting sandwiches, 1 small bar. Al this to serve hundreds of people that are waiting to see if their flights will be cancelled or not. Finally, after 24hrs of being moved around from gate to gate and delayed, they got us on a plane. The pilot explained what led to all the delays and why we are still delayed. The Airport has only 1 Defreezer truck. It can de freeze 1-2 planes then has to go refuel, which takes 2 hrs. So, we were waiting for our turn to be defreezed. After about 20 min, the pilot gave us an update saying that the defreezer has a malfunction and the tech is coming to fix it. A little later, we got an update that said: well, I can see that there is only 1 person loading the luggages, so this may take a little while before we can even move the plane. In the meantime, we are still waiting on the update for the defreezer. A few minutes later, the pilot says we just found out that the mechanic is on his way and should be there in about 30 min. Damn. Im not sure what is going on, but the airport is supposed to be prepared for planes to fly!"

There was no enforcement of any of the covid guidelines set in the UK, or when there were some attempts at social distances they made no sense and were extremely redundant. When exiting the plane after waiting for the majority of the passengers to leave, I was approached by a very rude and hostile security guard. As I was travelling alone he made sure to speak with me rather than the family with two children (with no masks) walking behind me. I have taken the covid precautions seriously therefore I was wearing PPE (white disposable overalls, n95 mask, and face shield). The guard, sarcastically mocked if I were travelling to paint and then began berating me about how it is my fault that there is still a pandemic going on. Considering that there are far more people who flaunt their ignorance of the guidelines it is baffling why he was being like this about it whereas the family behind me was let off. Ridiculous. The border control guard, however, was the complete opposite. He asked about my reason of visit which I promptly gave as well as telling him all the precautions I have taken and he was very polite and understanding and let me through with not an ounce of attitude."

This is an incredibly long walk for an airport of this size - they state 7 minutes. Also, they oriented the entry to the airport at the end of terminal A instead of the middle. So for 3/4ths of the gates, get ready to walk. Also, terminal B, there are few amenities vs terminal A. Finally, for baggage claim, you need to commit to walk to one side or the other to see the posted bag claims for your flight. They should have signage before you have to commit to one side or another, otherwise you have to back track. Just feels like they could have accomplished all this with half the footprint. With all of the airport experience around the works, it is impossible to believe this airport could have been this poorly designed.

This is the worst practically new airport I've seen anywhere in the world. I don't know what the casino revenues collected in Vegas, or even the airport itself, are going toward, but it sure isn't toward having a meaningfully modern, efficient airport, despite the many years and dollars spent on revitalization. For the pros - 1) Baggage claim was actually efficient. 2) Signage inside the airport was ample. That's about it. As for the cons? 1) There is no efficient means to take a rideshare or taxi, as the wait for either can be over an hour. It took me 40 minutes and I felt lucky compared to the people around me. 2) There's no effective means of public transportation to the Strip and this is considering that the airport is practically on the Strip! Not even a monorail. 3) The terminals have mostly new, though very depressing and uninviting, architecture and design. 4) The terminals were poorly lit, in both the late evening and early morning. 5) I saw a tiny handful of anyone working in the airport who smiled, or who otherwise just didn't look angry. 6) Airline (baggage claim) and security personnel were almost entirely ill-mannered and officious. Not just ""having a stressful morning and need coffee,"" but flat-out rude. 7) Apparently this airport doesn't believe in automated check-in and baggage machines, even though they're chock full of them, Alaska, Frontier, Southwest, etc. weren't operating theirs, and required their passengers to stand in long lines (of course, if you checked in in advance and have no baggage to claim, this isn't a problem for you). 8) LAS is just a really dirty airport overall, plain and simple. 9) Practically nothing was open in the airport at either 9pm or 6am, I guess this isn't a huge deal to me only because we're still in the midst of a pandemic. I understand that LAS has to interact with a never-ending array of passengers who don't even understand clear airport signage or etiquette, but I would respectfully suggest that LAS look to Salt Lake City (stunning new airport with overall great service) or even Phoenix (which is above-average but not great) as examples of how to operate a respectable airport."

Another thing I am extremely bothered by is how the people on the shuttles from off site parking facilities are treated like second class citizens. Those shuttles are no longer permitted to drop passengers off at the main doors. Instead they are dropped off downstairs, outside and made to trek completely through the car rental parking lots and up escalators to check in. Hotel shuttles are permitted to drop off at the main doors so why not off site shuttles?. Let's see - could it be that airport officials are trying to force passengers to pay their outrageous rates to park in their long term lots? It almost seems like they are trying to put the off site lots out of business! Terrible, terrible experience all around!

2021-04-01,2021-04-01,7.0,"""SLC is a sterling, world-class airport, with some wrinkles""","  | SLC is a sterling, world-class airport, with some wrinkles. To begin, I absolutely do not understand the onslaught of negative reviews for the newly-completed (and still under-construction) SLC redo. The only explanation I can think of is that those negative reviews are from people driving in from some place like Magna, West Valley, Brigham City, or Wendover who just don't like big cities and big changes. Let me start with the positives of the new SLC, and there are many: 1) TSA staff who are helpful, polite, and explanatory, who don't bark orders officiously, and who efficiently process passengers. The best TSA I've encountered in almost any airport in the USA, except possibly some small airports like Lexington. 2) Architecturally stunning, post-contemporary, and a generally relaxing, open-air design; the closest thing I've seen in the USA to a Seoul Incheon, Hong Kong, and Sydney's Kingsford Smith (though those airports are even more beautiful). 3) Countless art displays in the terminal, completed concourses, and the underground walkway connecting the concourses at present. 4) Dining and shopping options in the Delta concourse (A). 5) Ample displays and signage, from the time you leave I-80 or North Temple to the time you arrive at your gate. 6) Luggage carts prominently located at the entry to the terminal (although you have to pay for them, and I don't like that we have to do that at US airports in general when you don't always have to in other countries). 7) Accessibility by highway, TRAX light rail, or rideshare is a breeze. 8) It's close to downtown, and still a 45-minute drive from Park City, Antelope Island, etc. 9) The restrooms (men's anyway) have stalls which afford full privacy, common in western Europe and wealthier Asian countries but rare in the US. Now, there are some drawbacks that will need to be worked out: 1) There really needs to be significantly improved accessibility between the terminal, baggage claim and concourses, hopefully the new tunnel under construction will remedy that, but there is no excuse for this airport to not already have an active tram. However, despite the naysayers' reviews, it takes 15 minutes to walk across the airport, not 30 minutes. 2) The food and dining options in concourse B (Alaska, Frontier, Southwest, etc.) could stand to be more numerous. I'll also say that while Uinta Brewing is a great place for a locally-brewed beer, they could stand some competition, as the service frankly wasn't very attentive or friendly. 3) The Southwest personnel weren't very friendly, though at least they weren't rude or hostile like I've experienced from SWA at other airports. 4) If you want to rent a car from SLC, you'll be paying a ridiculous airport surcharge of some kind, I took an Uber to and from Millcreek to rent a car. Even considering the cost of Uber, I still saved $80-100 rather than renting at the airport. I noticed that the rental car facilities from Farmington all the way down to Sandy were almost entirely booked, but the airport still had rental cars available. This is an obvious problem. 5) The WiFI is terrible and needs to actually be accessible for passengers. So, wonderful job overall, SLC! In fact, I'm impressed. Just work out your wrinkles, always find ways to improve and execute plans of action, and you can complete with the very best in Europe and even some in east Asia!"

2021-04-12,2021-04-12,3.0,"""how is this even legal"""," |  In an age of project planning, focus groups, and ADA, how is this even legal. Appalling. When I got on the departing flight, a young guy said to the person sitting next to him, ""How many times do you think we've heard the word 'ridiculous' in the last 45 minutes?"" I like to walk, and I didn't have a bag, so my concerns are for those with heavy backpacks, small children, the aged, the unfit, and those on tight schedules. I pity anyone who has more than one of those factors. After a shocking experience departing the airport, I decided to start my pedometer on the airplane when arriving at gate B8, which is not the most distant gate. You could very easily add another .25 miles to the number I'm about to share if you had a B25 gate, or similar. I started my pedometer when I got off the plane to see how far it was to the long-term parking shuttles. It clocked in right at .75 miles. (So if you had a B25 gate, for example, it would be over a mile, I think.) A few other factors to into it to make it better and worse than it sounds. 1) I didn't use any of the moving walkways last night, one of which wasn't working, anyway (at a brand new airport - it had an out of order sign). I did that for two reasons: to measure and also because no one stays to the right on the walkways so you can pass, because they're all so tired of walking. That means that the moving walkways actually slow down the sense of progress you feel you're making on the sojourn. 2) On the escalators, no one walks them, either (for the same reason), so you just have to stand there. Standing actually tires me more, and it's a little frustrating if you're in a hurry. The escalators serve a necessary purpose, though - you probably wouldn't want to opt for the stairs (stair steps, by the way, would add to the length I tracked). You're going under the tarmac above you, and the escalators cover a pretty significant drop and climb. Again, the escalator (and moving sidewalk) could either give you a sense of rest or drive you crazy because they poke along and no one moves on them. If you're in a hurry, you're pretty stuck or you'll need to break a sweat and do the stairs twice (down and up on the other side). 3) There was not a long TSA line, but the wait was still lengthy. The tray system is now automated, but it doesn't speed things up. I think it slows it down. Back in the day, a human being could remove trays and take them back to the front, now they have to be left on the belt to be collected at the end, and the belt isn't very long and there's no place but at the belt to pull your stuff off (often to put it on again). The way they file the people through and screen the trays, the trays and people conning through aren't in the same order--not even close to it (which has always been the case to some degree, but it is way worse now). So TSA will either give you the impression of being able to take a breather or it will ultimately add to the length of your airport marathon. A few other random gripes are that even that strange, white fabric wave art installation (which didn't appear to be working) is an extension of the utter lack of practical planning this entire airport disaster represents. The airport is barely six months old, and it already looks dingy from airplane exhaust. Whoever thought that was a good idea? I remember the lack of cleanability was something observers talked about from day one. The added time makes driving to surrounding states seem better."

I was excited to try out the new airport since I'd heard so many things about how streamlined and efficient it would be. That is absolutely not the case. When we first departed from the airport, I was very disappointed with how humongous it is, with no concessions for people to move through it easily (except a few slow moving walkways). It is so large it's difficult to get from one place to another, and it takes forever to get anywhere. It seems as if you're walking for miles before you get to your destination, and the signage is not clear, you're not sure where to go. It was a disappointing experience. However, our return experience was even worse! We are 65 and 70 years old. Although we're on the older side, we're in pretty good shape, having just returned from a dive trip. After traveling all day and being worn out from travel, we thought we were going to die of exhaustion before we got out of there. I'm sure we must have walked over two miles just to get out! I have a bad right hip which is usually manageable, but after walking and walking and walking, and walking some more, I thought I was going to die before I got out of there. There are no accommodations for those with health difficulties - how did they ever pass ADA regulations? I didn't see one vehicle that could move elderly or disabled people from one place to another. The design is horrendous - it is so spread out, it's definitely not conducive to anyone that has difficulties ambulating. There is no tram system, as is used in most other airports to move people from one section of the airport to another. Although there is a place for a future tram, it needs to be put in place immediately, not years down the road. And, the way it's laid out, I'm not sure it will decrease the walk time for the patrons. Who designed this thing, and did the city actually sign off on the design? Did they not care about whether it was doable for its patrons? Obviously, no one thought about those that cannot easily walk several miles. And, they have cast the parking shuttles into outer darkness, probably to benefit themselves and their own parking garage. After picking up baggage, you used to be able to walk out the door and pick up the parking shuttles. Now, after walking through the whole airport, you then have to walk another half mile to get to the outside rim of the parking lot to a small designated spot for the parking shuttles. It appears they're trying to drive them out of business and inconvenience their customers! It is really a travesty!

For over 20 years, I have disliked this airport - it is dirty, with customer service representatives who apparently hate their job. It has been my only option for a specific sole airline that flies into a small airport north of SF, where my family lives. A couple years ago, I was heading to my family's hometown on a Friday for my husband's memorial service the next morning, where he had spent most of his adult life serving the public (the local service where we lived at the time of his death was for friends at our new home). Soon after my husband's death, due to shock, I had fallen down a ladder and broke my heel. For the trip, I had been recovering for 3 months and still used a cane. My flight to SF was delayed by SF due to weather - a common occurence. My connecting flight from SF to the hometown was delayed over and over on the hour. When I asked a customer service rep about this and explained that I needed to get to my husband's memorial service, he just shrugged. He had no answer whether the flight would go or not. At 11 p.m. that night, I requested wheelchair service to go to the car rental station, and the customer service rep just stared at me and acted like she didn't understand English. I went to a different desk and requested the same thing, then I rented a car to drive 5 1/2 hours to our hometown to make sure I could get to the memorial service. My understanding is that my connector flight never flew there that night. The airline carrier also did not refund me for that leg of the journey. In the most recent case this April, I recently flew the same route to visit family over spring break. On the return trip, SF delayed our takeoff for an hour, causing me to miss the last flight out of SF to my hometown. The reason -- runway renovations. By the time we arrived in SF Airport, there were no customer service reps available, no food available, and the airline customer service rep's only option was to hand me a flyer with an 800 number to reserve a hotel room ""at a discount"" for the night through Roomstorm, whereby I was charged by both Roomstorm for the very expensive hotel reservation as well as the hotel. I would not recommend this airport to anyone. I am thankful that soon the hometown airport will have a different carrier option, with direct flights to and from that completely bypass SF."

I felt the same way when I came through this airport about 5 years ago, but it was under construction of some kind so I assumed there was good reason. Nope, still appalling. No construction today but equally dismal. Shocking really, an embarrassment to America. Nowhere to sit other than the gates and a handful of dirty tables in a food course (7!)  and no plug points available for people needing to charge devices (well all apparently deliberately turned off), despite the obvious necessity), and no real food  all fast food, at absurdly exorbitant costs. I paid $20 for one fish taco (takeaway fast food) and a beer. As my first stop in my homeland after 3 years, I feel like getting on the next plane out again. Shame on you LA airport designers! Horrific. Then one is bombarded by continuous loud repetitive messaging from megaphones. Seriously, take a trip to Paris and learn a bit of class for pleasurable airport environment  that is, if you care about customer experience."

I have flown into countless airports domestically and internationally and never had such an awful experience. I absolutely will never fly into or out of this airport again and I strongly suggest that no one else does either. I will gladly pay more money to fly in and out of a smaller airport.

It all started getting off an international flight where we had to walk half way across the airport. Then after going through the gauntlet of passport control then I stepped in a room of mass hysteria to get my luggage, then drop it off. Then I was directed to go upstairs to check in for my connecting flight, only to be told they dont have TSA precheck. After going through the security check then I had to go back downstairs to catch a train to go to my terminal which was filthy. The only light to this was the handsome CBP security officer who stopped to check my passport. He was the highlight of me coming back from Puerto Vallarta! This airport needs to do better.

But one visit stands out above all others - when climbing the stairs from the toilets near the departure gate, I was rather surprised to see something small and furry running on the step above, a baby rodent! Quite unbelievable to find a mouse in a UK international airport terminal. Two girls descending screamed and I immediately looked for a staff member, I found a 'large' bloke in a hi-viz vest sitting scoffin' his 'scran' who casually replied: 'Yeah, they're all over mate - the place is infested with 'em, they're in the roof!' Then continued to eat - never even got up to look or report it! I later googled images of young rodents, I have a horrible feeling it was a baby rat! Manchester Airport takes no notice of complaints - one employee told me in hushed tones to contact the local mayor Andy Burnham as according to him the council considerably subsides the operation.

I've listened and talked to airline personnel, strangers, and friends about how painful it is to walk such long distances and the limited food/drink options.

2021-05-11,2021-05-11,1.0,"""Ive never seen anything like it in my life"""," |  Literally the worst airport experience Ive ever had in my life. If you can help it at all, do not fly into or out of this airport. We were departing back to Philadelphia from Florida yesterday and arrived at the airport with 2 hours and 45 minutes before our flight. Walked into a line wrapped around the entire one side of the airport wondering what the hell was going on. Turns out it was the security line. There had to be over 600 people in this line, all very disgruntled to say the least. It took us over two hours to get to security. We rushed our things through and ran to catch the shuttle with our shoe laces untied. Luckily got onto the shuttle as the doors were closing and sprinted to our gate from there with about 5 minutes to spare before the doors closed and we missed our flight. The thought of missed our flight only to have to go back to ticketing and returning to that torturous security line again was enough to make us prepare to drive two hours to another airport to fly out of. Despite the fact that we made our frontier flight by a hair, we ended up sitting on the plane for another 30 minutes to wait for the 56 (!!) passengers that were still not present for that was supposed to be a full flight. The airline waited for about half of them to get onto the plane and had to leave the other 20 some passengers behind. This experience alone made an otherwise decent trip a horrible experience that we were left with. I will never ever ever fly into or out of this airport again and urge others to consider the same. Aside from the insane waiting and stressful rushing to our gate, the staff at the airport was very rude and cavalier about the situation. Non apologetic, no concern and just flat out rude. Ive never seen anything like it in my life. On top of everything, we were practically starving for a period of 5 hours since the time we thought we might have to grab a quick bite before our flight was spent stressing in an insane line and frontier doesnt serve anything on the plan for passengers. I would have rather driven to Florida. Also, I was forced to give this airport one star for some reason, but they deserve negative stars. Steer clear!"

If that was not enough, I have never had to deal with a more rude and uncouth staff than here. I was travelling with a couple of tech items and the rude lady at security started screaming (yes, screaming) contradictory instructions at me while I was simply getting everything on the trays. Later, while I was trying to remove and assemble my things from 4 trays after passing through security, I have another lady telling me thrice to stack up my trays. In which airport is that the job of a passenger? Every airport I have ever been to either uses belts that automatically stack these up or airport personnel do this manually. How is a passenger supposed to be stacking trays with hands full of expensive things that need to be repacked? Would recommend flying via SFO instead because LAX has got to be the worst airport in the world in every possible aspect."

It then starts a long walk down a hall, then down an escalator, then down a long hall, then up an escalator, then down a long hall till it breaks up into 2 halls to gates. So ridiculous. I am seriously considering never using SLC airport again. I would rather drive 12 hours to my destination then walk that ever again. Just getting to baggage claim is a nightmare and then figuring out how to get outside to get picked up, a whole new nightmare.

On level 2 there is a single TSA check point. The line had to be at least a 1/4 mile long.

The restaurants had very long lines, so I stopped in a convenience shop and got a sandwich to avoid the lines. Dogs: They have airport comfort dogs, I was really hoping to see one. Unfortunately, I did not. Maybe next time. Staff: Everyone was helpful and friendly. One of the young men sanitizing surfaces was actually dancing and just made you smile. The shop cashier told me I can grab a free bag of chips since I got the sandwich and a bottle of water. The gate attendant cheerfully added a note to allow me to pre-board, as I cannot pivot and navigate a tight space easily and unbeknownst to those around me, it brings me great physical pain to have to pivot and dodge other people and their baggage. She did however, add a request for a wheelchair, which I did not request and it caused some confusion for the staff at the destination terminal. CONS - Seating: There are not enough accessible seats. I needed a place to eat my sandwich and the rocking chairs were full and all the atrium seats that I could find were bar stool type chairs that, due to my handicap, I am completely unable to get on and off.

All but (2) of the he convenience stores are closed and those have huge lines. The restaurant services should be for the peoples convenience and not the restaurant's convenience. Why hasn't the management observed this and made adjustments? I don't think they should stay open all night, but this is a little ridiculous.

SLC used to be a great place to transfer with immediate access to the terminal via a short concourse upon deplaning. Now for the smaller flights you get dropped off on the tarmac where a shuttle specific to that flight awaits the plane. The worst part is that that shuttle will not leave the location until every last passenger, crew member and checked carry-on luggage has been piled into the shuttle. Expect an extra 20 minutes at least until you get to the terminal. I now avoid SLC at all costs and drive a bit to other airports that don't force an SLC stop, but unfortunately I'm captive many times and there are no other solutions.

Our plane sat on the tarma longer than it should have before letting us disembark therefore we had limited time to get from place to place. Signs were not placed well to direct which way to go to B terminal and the walk was horrendous. The mass of people walking through the airport was unbelievable and although moving sidewalks were offered, with people not moving over to allow the folks that need to get somewhere to get there. Do not go to this airport if you can't walk well or long distances. Get some trains like Atlanta, or something. Poor design. I will find another airport to go to before I fly back thru this one.

I am disabled and upon arrival at Terminal E I found no wheelchair staff (the BA agent had to call for one after I had been standing for nearly 10 minutes, which is physically difficult for me) and no skycap to handle my family's nine pieces of luggage. The driver who had brought us to the airport had to risk getting a ticket or getting towed to help my son get the luggage inside and then my son had to place the luggage on the scale with no assistance. After we went through security, we were taken to the gate to wait (even though we were Business Class passengers) because the lounges were not open. We also were unable to find food to eat or coffee because all of the shops were still closed, even though many restrictions in Boston have been lifted with regards to the pandemic. The only other time that I have experienced such a lack of service was in Seattle, which has a much smaller airport. Seriously people, if you can't provide a wheelchair or a skycap for a disabled person, why are you even open? The only plus in this entire experience was the gentleman who finally showed up to take me through the terminal in a wheelchair (after they called him). He was great and came back on time to help me board my flight. At least someone there understands customer service."

There needs to be a subway/rail system set up to accommodate travelers better. They do have moving floors in the tunnel, but there are gaps that don't have the floor. Not sure why anyone would want to get off the floor midway through a tunnel that has no services or even a bench to sit on. At minimum they should have installed two floors for each direction and have them run the entire length. Restaurants and shops are sparse in the B terminal.

Twenty to thirty minute walks are great, except when traveling through an airport, but that is what the geniuses responsible for this design came up with. I suppose it didn't dawn on them the elderly, or those with ambulatory issues, may have to use this facility.

The bottleneck at TSA is a new twist which usually wasn't a problem before. One of the most egregious hallmarks of this billion dollar monstrosity is no train and/or shuttle. The walking sidewalks (if working) move pathetically slow. The elderly, the disabled, the unconditioned are forced to walk 1+ miles to terminal B. The response to these complaints from the paying public is signage ""distracts from the beauty of the building"", ""wheelchair transport should be arranged through the airline by you"", ""TSA is being thorough"", ""we don't have a shuttle due to too many accidents"", ""there is a train scheduled to be up and running in 2024"".

I have regularly traveled to SLC over 55 years but will no longer do so because there is an utter lack of assistance for those who are physically disabled. I was forced to walk well over 1 mile to baggage claim and then the vehicle rental area because of a lack of wheelchair or electric cart assistance. And I had ordered this assistance in advance. I was told to ""wait"". After 30 minutes, the wheelchair never arrived and there was no United Airlines employee at the gate to check on the status of the wheelchair while I waited. Needless to say, the walk not only caused me pain, but also exacerbated my injuries. Further, I was almost knocked down twice by people running to catch connecting flights because they were not allowed sufficient time to cover the 1 mile walk in a safe manner. In the future I will fly to Boise, St. George, Las Vegas or other locations which do not connect to SLC and then drive to SLC if I have to go there in order to avoid the airport.

We had only 10 minutes to complete the security checks before our plane boards. The tram for gate 1-29 is the only tram that is separated by ""Exit"" door once the passengers depart the tram lobby area. The logistic of this tram design is so absurd that even though passengers already went through security check, but if you use the lounge (tram 1-29), and have to depart to any other gate, you have to go through security again.

The seat was very narrow and did not have adequate hand holds.

We arrived at an elevator and he told us to get off and go down and another cart would be waiting. We had to get off the cart and on to another cart. Then that driver did the same thing to us. Made us wait for another cart. Then a third cart arrived. At that point we chose not to get on that cart. I walked very slowly to our gate which thankfully wasn't very far.

After we boarded our flight to Kona we had to exit the plane due to an electrical problem. When I exited the plane I told a flight attendant I needed a wheelchair. I waited outside the door for awhile and another attendant told me I needed to go back to the gate. I told her I needed a wheelchair. I ended up walking again back up the ramp where we waited 2 hours while the plane was being repaired. One of the gate attendants came and apologized and said they haven't been able to hire enough people. This was the worst experience I've had at any airport since I have had to use a wheelchair when flying."

I experienced my first international arrival today and have to ask who approved grabbing luggage before checking passports? All of these people could be getting processed while the baggage makes the trek across the airport, now people have to line up for baggage, then go through customs...also, there will be people lining up with oversized baggage in the tight customs line.

So where are the airport beds for everyone who is exhausted from not being able to sleep on planes? or the standing areas to do work? Where is the progress?

We should be much more progressive these days - especially in places where thousands of people visit every day. Definitely things to think about and changes to make now."

It's almost like they took everything good about the last airport (and there was a lot of good) and tried to do the opposite. Starting with something the old airport struggled with, pickup and drop-off. The old airport was almost always packed and difficult to deal with, so what was their solution? Make less space to pickup and drop-off...brilliant!! Off to a great start! Now let's take something the old airport did well and completely butcher it. You had very little distance to walk with the old airport because you had two terminals with separate security lines (three if you count the international terminal, it was a genius layout). This new airport has one security line and then once you're in the terminal, you start all the way at the end of a quarter mile (at least) corridor. Then if you want to get to the next terminal, you have to walk halfway down the first, then another 1/8th of a mile under the tarmac, then walk all the way down to wherever your gate is. I mean, it's laughable how poorly it is designed. Especially given that most people in Utah have a ton of kids. I only have two (very) young kids and it is a nightmare to get luggage and kids from the drop off area all the way to the gate. We were lucky enough to have another couple help us each time we've done it. The brain power and decision making that went into this new airport is embarrassing. At least look at what works at other airports and copy that if you can't come up with a better idea. I can only think of one nice thing to say about this new airport, it looks nice."

Venture to the rotunda and same, the airport is shutting down while 100s of travelers are awaiting flights. Availability was already limited due to the port awarding contracts to new ventures and booting about long term airport tenants.

And then it took about 30 minutes to get to the car rental terminal. In order to go back to the airport to pick up my family flying in on a different flight, I found I needed to know exactly which gate they were arriving into. That meant I had to wait for them to land and get off the plane. My plan was to park and go inside to help them with their luggage and the babies. But since I had no idea where to go before they landed, I barely was able to even get to the correct terminal and gate before they were trying to collect baggage by themselves - 2 babies and a mom. There is no meaningful signage to direct a person to car rental return location. And I asked 3 different employees how to get there - 2 Terminal Link drivers and a TSA agent who just happened to be on his lunch break, thank goodness. The 2 Terminal Link drivers had no idea. The TSA agent said he was pretty sure I would have to exit the airport then turn around. He thought the car rental return location was only outside the airport. Considering I had been driving around for what seemed like a lifetime, I did as he recommended. But the signs only said rentals, not car rental return. I followed this sign and ended up in front of the car rental terminal, not the right place. At first the Hertz agents tried to direct me to get back in their vehicle and drive somewhere else. I lost it. The agents then whispered to themselves - probably deciding if they needed the men to bring the white suits - but then one of them agreed to look at the vehicle and drive it to the correct location herself. I cant say how much I appreciated that, I was so supremely frustrated at that point. But, seriously, never again will I put myself through this frustration."

Never mentioned a tram. So we wonder around again looking for a way to get to Terminal 3 because we arrived in terminal 1. There are no signs anywhere but on the last elevator by the front door.

Detroit, perhaps the best example of linear design, has a tram system. SLC has nothing. Also, there is only one Delta sky club and it is located at the farthest point from all gates. Long tunnel, long concourses, 30 minute walk (no exaggeration) and then a bus to the plane. This SLC is perhaps the poorest airport design in all of my extensive travel experience and certainly not what you would expect from a new airport.

I have called my congressman about this issue. Arrival at the baggage area, no vending for water. It was over 100 degrees out. Nobody to help, no information booth.

When queuing for security, I notified one of the security staff that my flight was boarding and they informed me that there was time and it would be ok. When I got to the scanner, the system broke down and had to be transferred to another unit. This airport is a shambles and I cannot believe it is allowed to continue.

I cant tell you how many people I saw looking around bewildered, as well as heard complaining about the walk. Follow the signs for the AirTran and take that all the way to the end.

2021-07-26,2021-07-26,4.0,"""This airport is badly designed""","  | This is probably the worst airport I have been through. And I once worked at JFK with its many terminals. I had to transit through this airport from Costa Rica to catch a domestic flight to JFK NYC. There are no restrooms in the immediate area. The plane I came off had one aisle. And the flight attendants spent a good deal of time using the aisle to serve snacks. So it's not always convenient to use the restroom on the aircraft. Common sense you would think they would place restrooms near where the gate is where we got off the plane. Then it's not like you can just walk to the CBP area. We had to stand there for as much as 15 minutes and more at least twice before being allowed to proceed to the long line to present our passports. Walking from the gate to the CBP seems like 1/4 of a mile. There were hundreds of people on the line. There is a restroom in that area but with such a long line and a connecting flight less than two hours of my arrival I did not want to chance using it then getting on line. The saving grace was that the customs officer did not take long with my passport. He basically looked at my photo, asked me to remove my mask then asked me if I am who it says I am. Then I was on my way. It took over one hour to exit the CBP line. Someone took my luggage and put it on the belt to be sent to my JFK NYC flight. As soon as we walked out of that area we all had to go through security as if we had just walked off the street. I overheard one of the TSA agents telling someone that until you reach age 75 you have to remove your shoes. Well around where I live I see people who could barely get on the bus without the driver lowering the stairs. And many of these people are not even 50 years old. After going through security I checked the board but could not find my flight listed. I asked a lady at information desk. She told me I had to take the shuttle train on the right hand side one stop to area E. And go to E11. I went to E11. No such flight. I went to the Delta counter I saw when I came to area E. The lady told me I had to go to E 31 and the flight is about to leave so I had to hurry. I was the last person to get on the plane when I heard them say they were about to close the door. A gate agent came with me. She said there was no more room for my carry-on so I had to check it but not before I removed my laptop and camera which most likely would be stolen. My advice is avoid this airport if you're connecting from an international flight. Connecting domestic to international was not an issue when I was leaving. Unless you got four hours between international arrival and your departure connection don't risk it. And putting a restroom all the way in the customs area serves no purpose because most people need to use the restroom as soon as they exit the plane. This airport is badly designed. When I was leaving for Costa Rica I arrived after 8 am on a weekday morning and none of the restaurants were open. Not even a place to serve coffee. It's as if the airport was designed for the convenience of airport staff and not its passengers!"

TSA pre check had 3 lines and the clear queue funneled to one gentleman. Frazzled I held up my pass and he gave me the 'lady put it on the scanner look'. At least he apologized when I complained about booking a terminal length to go through his line on the south. Finally through TSA and down the stairs to very backed up and broken train the terminals. After three trains I was able to get one to the C gates. I charged to the gate with a few minutes to get some water for my asthma which was now flaring up from all the people, the humidity in the terminal and my perspiration soaked mask. I asked where the water was to fill my bottle and was told it was 30 gates away back in the center. I did not want to risk missing boarding so I went to vending and found one machine half empty with only pepsi and mt dew. No water. In desperation I got a pepsi. Then I went to the restroom - the stall floors were littered, soap dispensers empty. The germiest place on earth is a bathroom and without soap or even hand sanitizer I cannot follow covid protocol. Disgusting and contrary to the mask mandate. Understood and even flexible that Covid has taken its toll on everyone but the lack of signs, supervisors, and basic needs is unacceptable.

Once you clear customs, they don't have a dedicated security spot set up (they do but its all blocked off), so you have to exit the security area and re-enter in the main terminal with everyone else. For a brand new airport design that's completely unacceptable. Finally, the design is just an extremely long terminal building (think San Jose on steroids).

I had recently had a left hip surgery and had to push my mother in order to get down to the baggage area. How can an airport with this much traffic, not set up a contract to help with their customers in need of wheelchair assistance?

The TSA agents kept giving me conflicting instructions. Take off your shoes, you can put your shoes back on if you walked through the K9 area, put your shoes on to walk through the metal detector. It made absolutely no sense and when I acknowledged it I just received blank stares from them. The conveyor belt stopped working because someones bag jammed it because the TSA agents failed to tell the person to put their bag in a tray. I watched them watch the person put the bag loose on the conveyor belt and then fail to give them correct instructions. Then as they were trying to fix the jammed conveyor belt a TSA agent came over to where I was and said that it had stopped working because a tray was still in the tray dispenser. I dont believe this had anything to do with what the problem was, and there were trays sitting in other tray dispensers, but they decided it was the one in front of me that was the problem and gave me stern look. Again, that makes no sense, my tray didnt jam it. They need to improve their system and communicate better with each other and with people who are traveling because we are not mind readers. I see this happen a lot with incompetent employees, they can easily blame the customer for a problem. In this case it really seemed like the TSA agents were causing problems for themselves. What would a person gain by not following instructions and delaying their travel time at the airport?

Due to last minute CDC and govt Covid rule changes, it was canceled.

The only deposit we could not fully get back was parking at Tampa International. Of the $90 charge, we got back only $45. Tampa airport used to be the best airport in the country. Since Lopano took over, it has gotten progressively less customer-focused. Maybe Tiliocos, VP of Customer Service, has something to do with it? I emailed those two and the Feldman, head of parking. Obviously they got my emails, since Feldman, head of parking, called me to tell me personally to bugger off. Of the $5K for the trip, 45 is peanuts. But it shows how cold and uncaring the TPA has become. My flying has decreased in recent years, but I used to have gold cards on 4 different airlines and traveled at least once every week, out of Tampa.

The old airport was better from a passenger perspective in every conceivable way. The old airport was smaller and never built to exist in the current airport climate, yet it worked, and it had character and was a pleasant space. It never felt overly crowded even on busy days and with small concourses. Now the new airport 'feels' packed and its 5x larger. Everyone is channeled into the same spaces. Nobody likes walking in tunnels - in the hold airport you had to walk distances between concourses but they were pleasant walks with views. Now you know you are walking in a basement. I could go on and on and on - but it suffices to say the design is poor, the capacity feels *reduced* versus the old one, and its as cold and sterile a design that feels unpleasant to spend time there. There is nothing 'warm' in this design, it is like spending time in a hospital, how nice! Everything that everyone else says about it is true. It is a complete bomb.

Twice this summer I had to experience the gridlock of cars attempting to pick up people at this terminal. There is no way to pull over to pick up people, even when they are right there waiting out front. The security officers yell at you to keep driving around, adding to traffic issues and do not give you a chance to pull over. My 80-year-old mother was stepping across several lanes of traffic to try and reach me and the security officer was yelling at both of us. I had already circled around 3 times! The poorly run arrival area looks like a COVID hotspot. If they would let you pick up passengers, there would be fewer problems. They should redirect rental car buses to another location or spread arrivals out so there are fewer people trying to be picked up at the same time.

Im in decent physical shape, Im not Prefontaine (I picked a distance runner for a reason), but do work out 5-6 days a week. Also pre-Covid, I did a lot of business travel, 200K a year, and actually tried to go through SLC if an east-west layover was required, because it was a much more pleasant experience than Denver or Dallas. SLC was a great midsize airport. What happened? Im seriously gobsmacked how thoroughly botched this new one is. I mean its clean and looks nice, but its a functional disaster that must have been designed by a walking fetishist. I saw a different review comparing this airport to Incheon and Hong Kong, which makes me think theyve never been to those airports, because both have trams that get you close to where you need to go, have centralized shopping, lounges and food options, and have shapes not inspired by a giant equals sign. Its like the designers looked at Detroit and Atlanta, and said, That, but without the trains! My personal story, discovering that my favorite east-west hub had been brutalized, was a on this most recent connection, my first trip since Covid. The plane parked away from the terminals next to a ramp, where a bus would get us. Not ideal, but whatever, I have been to airports under construction and this happens. We deplaned, and got on the bus. On arrival to the terminal, things started to unravel. You arrive to a structure that looks like a shrine to the worlds longest ramps that's connected to the end of Terminal B. When you get on this thing and look up, its almost comical how long and skinny it is. Its no joke probably two hundred yards long, and a wheelchair wide. I dont know how this thing is legal for either fire or ADA, because getting a wheelchair up this thing would be brutal, and if theres a fire, theres no escape. When I finished my climb, I then did what I always do, find the lounge. I used up about 20 minutes of my 90 minute layover with the bus and ramp, but still thought I had time to grab some breakfast. This turned out to be about as naive as thinking you can win a land war in Asia. I was at one end of Terminal B, and my connection was on the other end of Terminal B. I figured the lounge would be central like they usually are. Really should have looked at a map. I saw signage, and began to walk, and walk. Got to the opening to the tunnel to Terminal A, the signage indicated the lounge was on the other side, and I figured it must be central in Terminal A near the tunnel, so still doable. Ten minutes and a broken conveyor later, I get to Terminal A, and start following signage. Walking and walking. At this point Im angry and committed. Turns out the lounge is at the very end of Terminal A, making it effectively useless for 3/4 of connecting traffic. I arrived 25 minutes after finishing the ramp hike, and scanned in for essentially a water break before my return journey to the connection that I now knew was a mile away. I arrived to my connection sweating through my shirt and angry, with my phone congratulating me for power walking nearly three miles. I understand this airport is a work in progress, but anyone who thought opening the airport in this state is negligent. I dont know how anyone with mobility issues or children could do it without severe distress. Considering the money involved, its borderline criminal."

While writing this review, sitting in terminal D, I have had to reconnect a half-dozen times. And there are no visible charging stations. Another problem here is the attitude of public who are evidently, we were told, protesting having to wear masks in the airport. Cant tell you how many people  including flight crew members  we saw walking the terminals with their masks under their noses or completely off.

Recently had the misfortune to travel via Manchester airports T1 - out of the numerous flight journeys weve made worldwide, Manchester airport has been our worst security experience by far. They have the most pointless, inefficient system weve come across anywhere and nothing that makes air travel any safer. This is topped by the rudest, most unprofessional staff who should never be in a customer-facing role. Every electronic item has to touch the tray base 100% with not even any overlap, bags lengthwise even if it fits perfectly inside the tray any other way, bags containing liquids can only be in their bags even if its only 1 chapstick in a slightly bigger bag - and there was a seemingly middle-aged male security staff who kept rudely shouting at my children and I even while we were trying to sort items as per their rules, leaving my children upset and worried. I was made to go through the body scanner and then frisked again by a security staff, not sure what the point of the body scanner was then. It took us around a 45-minute wait in the queue to get to the security and another 15 minutes to get through it.

The TSA here are the worst people I've ever encountered in air travel.  First time through TSA they not only rescanned my bag 3 times, but over 20+ people were waiting for their bags to be checked/rescanned. TSA agents kept saying that the picture was cut off and they were only allowed to rescan the tray. Hand checking not allowed. I suggested after the 3rd re-scan attempt, if they could please separate the tray as it seemed it being overloaded was causing issues with the scanner or if they could use another x ray machine. The TSA agent looked at me and said that was not possible and that the only way was to rescan it...again. I repeated myself because I just couldn't believe they didn't understand what I was saying, that the tray was too full and it might be better to split it into two trays. He took that as aggression and in turn chose to escalate the situation by saying ""you keep repeating yourself"" in a certain tone. Unfortunately, people need to repeat themselves when the other person doesn't understand a simple question. Not my fault you don't have basic comprehension skills. I noticed that there was a lady that seemed to be the head and I politely asked her if it was possible to split my tray up next time it comes up to be scanned. She reluctantly agreed. And it went through. Something that could have been resolved immediately with what you would assume be experience and knowledge doing the job. 45 mins of waiting around for that. Anyway, the skytram sucks. It takes about 30 mins or more to get to another terminal. The airport is so large, yet disorganized you really have to know where you're going if you want to make your connecting flight. On the way back from my trip, we got delayed (again because of how disorganized DFW operations is) and only had 40 mins to make it to our connecting flight in another terminal. TSA was NOT helpful in getting us expedited through security although it we were not at fault for the rush. I've seen other airports rush connecting flights through TSA if they were pressed for time, but they did not care at all. I asked the TSA agent at TSA precheck if he could please let us through so we can make our connecting flight, he said no. I then said what do you expect me to do to make this flight, and he said I needed to get in line or ask the 300+ people waiting in the security line to cut in front. So I did exactly that. I turned around to the line of 300+ people and yelled ""I apologize, but this TSA agent won't let me pass through without asking all of you if it's ok to cut in line, again I apologize but my connecting flight leaves in 30mins and I wont make it if I can't cut right now"" No one objected and I went through.

On Friday 27 Aug we arrived at JFK from an International origin as transfer passengers enroute to Washington DCA Airport. Our luggage was tagged from origin all the way thru to DCA. The luggage was off loaded from the aircraft and placed on baggage claim while we waited in line 2 hours to re-enter border passport control where only 5-6 agents were processing over 500 passengers, the employees handling the crowd could barely speak English and were extremely rude and unprofessional. Some airport employee placed our baggage at a transfer kiosk and left it sitting there unattended. There was an airport employee standing at a door doing nothing so we asked her why our luggage was just sitting there so long and she said someone would be there so we waited up to 30 minutes. The bags were sitting there for hours unattended because nobody would come and handle our bags and put them in a secure staging area for our connecting flight. We tried asking why and employees would just turn their backs and ignore us. We decided to take matters into our own hands and recheck our baggage at Delta Airlines Ticket counter. We just walked away from there with our bags and nobody said anything so there was unaccounted for bags now. After taking a tram and going up and down stairs to 3 different terminals we found an employee that placed our bags onto the incoming baggage belt where we hoped it would find its way to Washington DCA. We then took more trams to a shuttle bus which took us to another terminal where we went thru an absolute chaotic security without any instruction people were yelling pushing and shoving running and our Delta flight gate changed 3 times and was 2 hours late departing. Delta was late on our first flight and lost our bags at JFK and we got them 2 days later overseas while on vacation. It is impossible to navigate JFK because there are no maps and simple instructions for foreign passengers, you must ask one of the extremely rude barely English speaking airport employees who cant explain the complexity of finding your next terminal. You will have to run everywhere because transfer is so difficult and time consuming and information is unavailable. This airport is also dirty, smelly and worn out old. I would be willing to pay much more money to avoid New York all together for my next International Flight but it is so hard any International flights in the central USA."

Aside from perhaps the Berlin airport, this is the worst airport I can think of. For starters, the signage is a complete wreck. Departure gate info is so hard to see from the car rental return that I missed it not once, but twice, wandering around. Next, they have about 25 state-of-the-art check-in lines which are usually at half capacity or less. But the real kicker is that the TSA precheck line is at the very end of the line and is the old push your bags along the steel table throwback from 20 years ago. If that isnt bad enough, they allow anyone (precheck or not) through this line. So the precheck line is always the longest, because there is only one, it isnt automated, and you always have 5 people ahead of you stripping off all their clothes because they got in the wrong line and the airport is too cowardly to redirect them to one of the 12 open lanes they should be in! Complete lack of supervisory control. Then, when you get to the terminal, there is seriously almost no places to eat or shop. I dont know how to explain it. All that space and its just so poorly managed. Also its sterile. No character (unless you want to count a few hastily drawn murals in the basement). Ok. So I haven't even gotten to the worst of it. Here we go. The walk to B gate is unbearable. 20-25 minutes and I am not joking. And most of it is in the basement. Not a pleasant walk. But then when you get to your terminal and its time to board, they literally ignore all priority seating benefits and let everyone rush the podium at the same time. Then they lead you down a very long ramp to the tarmac. Then you are headed into a little tin shed that is not even weatherized. If it rains you get wet. If it snows, there is snow everywhere. Then you have to board a bus (Im not kidding) and wait there while they cram you in. Then you drive alongside the runway for quite a distance. A plane was taking off next to us and we were literally choking on Exhaust fumes. Then finally we get to our plane and basically free-for-all boarding. This airport is a $4 billion tragedy."

Waiting in line to speak with an immigration officer was not, in true Canadian fashion, the immigration officers weren't interacting very pleasantly with incoming visitors (the worst I've encountered in about 20 countries). Even though I had proof of a negative PCR test result and proof of full vaccination, I was still ordered to undergo a PCR test in the airport, as a random selectee (pursuant to Canada's Quarantine Act). The on-site personnel who registered patients and administered the tests were very courteous, which I appreciated. Nevertheless, while I greatly appreciate that Canada is taking this pandemic far more seriously and responsibly than the US, this random selection added some serious stress to the first 24 or so hours of my trip. Thankfully, I never had to actually quarantine anyway, as I tested negative and was even able to present that negative result for reentry to the US! Now, I'm glad to say that departing from Vancouver to go back to the US was a much easier process. All I had to do was present that PCR negative to the airline check-in in order to obtain my ticket, then go through Canadian security (as unpleasant as their immigration), then go through US immigration and customs using Global Entry. Using GE, I breezed through the US checkpoint in less than five minutes, with the most pleasant and professional immigration officer I've ever met (her fellow US officers, as well as Canada, should take pointers from her!) Then once in the trans-border section of the terminal, there were relatively few stores and restaurants open (due to COVID), but I was still able to buy coffee, souvenirs and lunch with ease, and pleasant service. The gate agent for United was also pleasant. The views upon arrival and departure can be spectacular. My only real complaints about this airport are the Canadian immigration and customs process, as well as the crummy restrooms and the fact that the facility is largely outdated, dirty, and just kind of depressing. All in all, YVR is slightly below-average. However, if you're flying to the ""Canadian Southwest""/US Pacific NW, then Seattle's airport is also generally dumpy, and Victoria (BC), Abbottsford (BC), and Bellingham (WA) will all be rather inconvenient to get to from Vancouver, so I guess YVR unfortunately doesn't find any incentive to improve at this time."

As an international conference planner, this was my first opportunity to 'escape' Canada for an international trip. Departure procedures took 2 hours (not exactly a stellar start) - but the return to Pearson - how embarrassing for a city like Toronto to be so disorganized. No social distancing whatsoever once you arrive into the customs hall. There were at least 1000 people snaking through (multiple international flights landing around 9.00 pm) - all of us crammed into the hall to line up for the machines for customs declaration. How many hundreds of people touched those keypads, no cleaning in between (as is promised on all the signs about extra cleaning efforts). Let's not even talk about the toilets. Then the Customs Officer wants to physically take our cell phones to see the PDF file of our negative Covid test. What is the point of filling out the ArriveCAN app and uploading all the docs if the experience is not going to be contact free. By the way, agent had no gloves on and saw this person touch all other phones ahead of us. I must ask - how does this help with potential spread of the virus. Baggage took an additional 2 hours. From landing to exit - an exhausting 3 hour experience. I am ashamed to call Toronto Pearson my home airport."

There was only one monitor to check for departing flights at the far end of the C concourse. This was frustrating as my departure gate changed twice. The departing flight was stuck on the tarmac for about 45 minutes due to Air Traffic. Who knew that a late night departure from LaGuardia could get delayed waiting to take off?

That is your responsibility sir, not mine, then she muttered idiot as she turned to put a tray back. The lady in front of me put her backpack in a tray and she pulled it out, yelled something at her, and said what is wrong with you people, you got a bag you put it on with no tray! Sheeesh. I put my bag on the rollersand she grabbed a tray to put it in to send through.

I have never been asked to remove that much before as I have TSA precheck (they have you carry a card to let TSA know, but they took it away with my shoes so I didnt have it for every time I had to take another piece of clothing off, but its but it didnt matter to them.). They complained that I didnt get out of the way fast enough when I had to go back. It seemed to be more about harassing the customers than safety anymore.

Their B and C concourses, though, are still relics of the 1980s, old, cramped, vastly outdated, and with disgusting restrooms. The dining and bar options were/are plentiful, although overcrowded and overpriced even by standards of major hubs. The inter-concourse tram is nice and efficient. Customer service is about like I remember it, whether while dining in or at the boarding gate: courteous and polite, but kind of detached and aloof. I've never met any personnel in this airport who were either outright rude or outright bubbly, I guess that's just the Seattle way. Alaska and Delta have nice lounges there, and, again, the N concourse is nicely redone, so there is some incentive to transit through there more often in the future, but the airport still has a lot to be desired yet in terms of overall customer experience.

I would say it was fairly well organized as they had people directing passengers to the booths. Not a bad experience. Just be prepared for a long walk and a long wait/standing. Here is my major complaint about this airport if you are arriving on an international flight. If your final destination is Atlanta and you wish to catch a ride share, MARTA or a hotel van, passengers are required to ride a small shuttle bus to Ground Transportation which takes 20 minutes. We had two heavy suitcases which had to be lifted into the bus. As we are over 65, it was difficult.

Especially the bathrooms. The airport has the feel of a Soviet-era prison without all the glitz. Sure, most airports today aren't fun. Weird TSA security layouts, understaffing, closed facilities. It's just the way things are. Denver takes it to another level. For example, the rental car facilities are dirty and understaffed. I waited almost an hour and a half in a rental car pickup line before I cancelled the car, walked out, and took Uber to Colorado Springs. The on-site gas station was unbelievably filthy with trash spilled all over the ground. If you're arriving on an international flight and have bags, you have to collect the bags and transfer them. This process is standard. At Denver though, you have to collect your bags, take them upstairs and outside to a curbside pickup, then return inside and downstairs to go through security. I might be able to overlook all this if the airport weren't in Colorado and 30 miles from downtown Denver. If you get stuck at DIA, you're spending a lot of time and money finding a hotel or a new wait out of the state. It's just not worth it. Play it safe and use SLC, Vegas, or Phoenix. If you're in Colorado, enjoy the breath of fresh air that is Colorado Springs Airport. You've been warned."

There was even a line in Nexus and I have never seen a line in Nexus in the amount of years that I have traveled. Myself and others ended up missing our flights, because airport personnel did not want to provide priority to those that have been waiting almost two hours (some even more) and their flights were departing within a short period of time. Air Canada needs to train their employees much better. When I missed my flight, I was told to go past customer service and use their courtesy white phones to reschedule my flight. I booked my ticket with United Airlines but it was operating through Air Canada. I even checked in through Air Canada and received my boarding pass with Air Canada. While I was on the phone with the rep, she advised (incorrectly) that I had to contact United. When I contacted United, they told me I should be speaking with Air Canada. Between 8.50am and 9.30am, I was on hold and being passed back and forth between the airlines. I then went to the Air Canada customer service desk and was able to rebook my flight without any hassle. So again, I was given the incorrect information from the Air Canada rep, whom I spoke with on the phone. By the time I was able to re book my flight, the next flight leaving wasn't until 2:45pm, connected in DC and my next flight out of DC wasn't til after 10.30pm. I spent 14-15 hours in airports for what would have been a 1 hour and change direct flight, if TSA coordinated much better. Also, we were required to take a covid 19 test prior to leaving the country and no one at Toronto Pearson Airport asked me for my Covid 19 results.

I cannot begin to describe how awful the experience was for my dad and I. The TSA were completely and unnecessarily rude to my dad who is easily confused and older, acted as if he had COVID or was diseased.

Additionally the representative at the Delta check-in desk who is posted there to help guests pre-check for their tickets was also so awfully rude. Asked again, another simple question and she acted as if we were burden to ask her anything instead of just letting her stand there and ruin her uneventful day. Normally at my hometown airport, they usually let my dad come into the terminal with me to say goodbye as any day I could get orders to deploy and wont have a chance to say goodbye before I go. But at this airport, I felt as though they were snatching him away from me and I was afraid he wasnt going to make his flight because it is an extremely large airport and he is older and just overwhelmed easily. Thankfully and barely, he made it to his gate. He then told me that he was just extremely disappointed because the associates at the counter by the terminal were rude over the intercom every time they used it and just rude to other guests that went up to the counter. It made him so uncomfortable with the entire experience that he never wants to fly out of the airport again and would love it if I never did either. It made him so upset that he ended up crying part of his flight home. Hes concerned that somethings going to happen to me on deployment and he wouldve never gotten to have said goodbye. Simple things like this go a long way for paying customers.

Our plane from Manchester arrived after the departure time. He kept arguing saying we missed our flight. No we did not miss our flight if it was delayed. He was a very rude and hateful man whom does not need to be dealing with the public. No reason for the hatefulness and rudeness. Very bad for business. Airport is very nice and well maintained but customer service is horrible. The lady at gate A8 would not even help us at all. She said I cant help you and dont know what to tell you. Thats terrible customer service. I usually fly into here but more than likely will not again. Very disappointed!

It appears that airport leadership is asleep on the job. Airport Parking is typically unavailable, construction seems to be never ending, flow of people inside & outside is mired in chaos, security is inept, food venues are sketchy and to top it all off - the unprofessional customer service attitudes reflects a growing personnel issue that seems to indicate poor training, poor work ethic, and a bizarre entitlement mentality. If you have a choice - find yourself a different airport - even if it means more connections.

The attendant was extremely helpful and polite, and explained everything thoroughly and made sure I had everything I needed to have for my arrival at my destination. Afterwards I went back to T5 to get a document signed. I had asked about it before and was told it could be signed if I came back after receiving my test result. I was a bit annoyed when I returned and they refused to sign the document. When I was going through security the staff was rude to me. I had started preparing my stuff in the line and was ready to finish unpacking my stuff once I could put my bag down. He kept repeating his instructions and did not give me a chance to finish before he repeated it again. I got very frustrated with him, which resulted in him being extremely patronizing."

Even the chairs outside the gates were a sleek design that all had functioning outlets (that we found.) The restrooms were the cleanest I've ever seen in any airport. Brightly lit, not a spot of graffiti or wear on their nice, tall, stall walls, all the chrome nicely polished, and all the soap/paper towel/faucet sensors worked flawlessly. It would probably be my favorite airport I've ever visited. Except...The distances are absolutely insane. I've read other reviews that spoke about the distances from the parking lot to rental cars/airport and I can't attest to any of those. I've never been to SLC airport besides for a transfer. But I can definitely tell you the distance from A to B concourse is long. I have mobility issues and fortunately for me, they had a wheelchair provided for me and to hold my luggage. But not so great for my companion who was walking alongside us carrying her own backpack and rolling bag. I even said to her when we finally got to our gate (at the very end of the concourse) ""Did that seem like a really long ride to you?"" She confirmed what I had suspected (completely out of breath) ""That was absolutely ridiculous. I was starting to lose you guys."" The sign as you enter the main hall connecting them even says right on it ""7 minute walk."" And that's assuming you are in relatively good shape with no physical limitations not to mention not accounting from where you came from in the previous concourse and where you have to go in the next. In our case, they both happened to be at completely opposite ends because of course they did. I would not be surprised it if was a mile of walking and possibly even more. My companion definitely got her steps in that day. It really is a nice airport overall, but God help you if you have a really tight connection."

Needless to say there was no explanation provided for this prolonged delay, nor were there any handling agents available to enquire of. We were not the last to receive our luggage as there were 20-30 people still waiting after we left the baggage hall.

Although I had already entered that on ArriveCan 72 hours prior to departure. I did not mind answering the same question again, however, the officer said I didn't pronounce the street name correctly and was annoyed by it. What brings you to Canada? We are here for visiting for the first time. 3) Officer asked me how I was getting around in Canada. I had rented a car. He asked me, ""do you know how to drive in Canada. ""Well I've never been to Canada, as I said this was my first time visiting, but I asked him, why is it difficult to drive in Canada? He says, well it's rains here. I'm sure he was assuming that because I'm from LA I don't know how to drive in the rain. Little does he know that I have driven South America and Mexico (where they don't obey the driving laws) and I how I have driven my RV cross country! 5) He asked me, after you leave the airport, where are you going? I told him our first stop was Gransville, then Gastown and then to our Airbnb. He looked down at my passport for a while and I asked him, Is Gransville a good place to eat, we are starving. He says, I don't know. We finally a clear to go to get re-tested for covid when I hear them paging my name. It was the airline that our baggage didn't make it to Vancouver and that it would arrive on the next flight the next day. The attendant at the counter had me file a report, gave me my incident number and then asked me to take a form over to exiting officer. We walk it over and once again we were questioned. I told the gentleman that I was to give him this form because our baggage didn't make it. Question: What is inside your suitcase? Our clothes and toiletries, What else? Our shoes. What else? Do you need me to name everything one by one? Any Alcohol or tobacco? No, we don't have any of that. Again, very rude.

For us 'non-citizens' only 27 terminals were available, doesn't sound too bad still however there were only 2 (two - I have to put it in brackets as it is barely believable), officers on duty for us So for the 3 flights of majority 'non-citizens' that had recently arrived (my approximation at least 400) we were being served by 2 officers. Well as you can imagine, considering they like to ask an awful lot of questions and take photos and fingerprints and all of that, it took an awful long time (4hrs by my count). Didn't even get a stamp in my passport (because of COVID) alright for people to stand in close proximity to each other for 4hrs though! First impressions of the 'greatest country in the world'- not so great."

Poorly designed from the outset, I have seen improvements made and they are more than welcome, but further upgrades are needed. Here's my experience with a few recommendations for improvement (hope management is reading!). Arriving in the baggage hall, there is no big screen indicating which carrousels are for which flights. You have to walk around and eventually you find it. Confusing to say the least. Having said that, luggage arrived fast, and immigration was relatively quick and pain-free. Agent was not unfriendly. Washrooms in arrivals area clean and modern. The UP train to Toronto Union station is excellent: comfortable, fast and not expensive. Upon departure, check-in and security were efficient and fast. The security area is a vast improvement from when the terminal was first built, and the walk to the international gate area seems much more spacious and attractive. There is fast and free WIFI. The international gate area (E gates) is another story - much too narrow a space and totally unfit for purpose, still crowded with strange tables and stools with Ipads (fine for eating but inadequate when waiting for flights with hand luggage) and a total lack of seating despite this flight being a smaller plane and not even full. No relaxing seating of the kind you find in multiple international airports around the world anywhere (not that there would be any space to put them). People were sitting on the ground and queues for flights snaked over into adjoining gate areas. Bathrooms near the gate are small and gross - it felt like something taken out of a high-school circa 1980. If there is one thing to say about this terminal it's inconsistency, with gate area spaciousness, seating (kind and amount) and queuing for flights being especially poor for a terminal of it's size. Needs a re-think if international hub status is every to be achieved."

I'm a young woman traveling alone and I don't need any man talking down to me and you can't even get ""thank you, have a nice day,"" from them. They were extremely rude about the mask I wore and told me to put a real mask on, even though it covered my mouth and nose. The mask I wear is an alternative for my asthma and how I am able to comply with it where it's needed. Meanwhile there were people walking around with none on at all so I don't even want to hear it.

We then made our way to the TSA Clear check-in and the first agent we encountered in no way deserves an employment opportunity that involves human contact. She was atrocious at best and I am thankful she is not empowered to carry a weapon in her position - she is dangerous! I do not suffer from any type of anxiety but after our check-in experience, I feel like I have been chased - and to think, we actually paid for the experience months in advance and went through the TSA pre-check interviews and all of the requirements only to be belittled, degraded, and treated like trash.

Additionally, the contracted employees that work at the airport (working for a third-party employer rather than actual airline employees) are absolutely miserable, and treat customers like they're an inconvenience.

It is only a matter of time before they get sued relating to a fall from one of those silly designs. 3) Terminal A layout - you enter at one end (rather than central) to new Terminal A. This means it is a very long walk down a bland design large corridor that goes on for seemingly miles - and that is just Terminal A. Bad luck if your gate is at the far end. 4) If you are in terminal B then even worse news - you have at least a ten to fifteen minute walk underground to get there. If you are elderly or unwell then tough luck as there is no transport system. To add insult to injury the tunnel you walk through is awful and smells stale. 5) Pick-up arrangements by private car more or less just copy the inadequate old airport model and are hopelessly inadequate. Really - no-one has given this any thought out of a $4.1Billion Budget! It is hopeless chaos at most times.

My children were literally walking out the door and the police officer told me to move now, I told him my kids are right there, he said no move now, go back around. I had to circle around 4 times to get my kids because they wouldn't allow you to stop more than 2 minutes. I was stopped a total of 8 minutes and told move now and was yelled at. Several people treated the same way. I use the airport 15 times a year every year and have never seen such rude behavior out of law enforcement.

Never in my life had I experienced such vile behavior, the abuse of power is very clear.

She was very impatient barking orders for me to scan my boarding pass and not giving me time to comply before barking another order what's my name she was so impatient. I have severe arthritis and it takes me awhile to use my hands due to stiffness and lost of feeling in my fingers. I handed her my ID as the scanner did not appear to be working. She was sucking her teeth and rolling her eyes it was so uncomfortable dealing with her attitude. I ask could I check my other bag if the flight was full instead of at the gate again due to disability of having to take bags to the gate. She then saw I had my 4 lbs yorkie in her carrier and stated is that an animal. I told her yes she is a dog, I was accused of trying to sneak the dog past her. She would not allow me talk at all. I finally asked for another agent to assist me while she continued to speak to me defensively. Finally another agent come over and took care of me while she continued to fuss in front of him. I asked her please stop speaking to me you are very rude and unprofessional. She threatened to not let me on the flight. I asked why because your being rude I have never had such a poor experience at an airport. I paid the pet fee and thanked the gentleman for helping me. He was very professional. Once I went through security with my pet. The agent that tested my hands was rude and yelled at me because I set my dog down on the counter to prevent from dropping her as he asked for my other hand. Yelled at me to don't put the dog on the counter as if she had rabies. She is a 4lb yorkie. I said sorry please don't yell at me I'm trying not to drop my dog. He was very rough with swabbing my hand and dismissive. I rarely write reviews but I have to let Atlanta know you need to do better. Not coming back through anytime soon. I will also be making complaint to Delta regarding treatment of passengers with disabilities need extra time to preform request.

This is not just covid related, this airport has consistently been a nightmare for as long as I can remember.

MAN has always been very slow for check in and especially security clearance. This past week was the worst I have experienced ever. Stayed over in the airport hotel so we could enjoy a leisurely morning ahead of our 12.30 flight on Aer Lingus. Went to check in [doc check] at 9.20 a.m. (!!!!) with queue of maybe 15 people and 3 counters, looked good. Ended up taking 45 mins [staff break, general sluggishness then down to 1 counter as line swelled]. Entered security - unbelievable. Conga line was 4 layers deep and although 6+ lanes had staff, only 2 were open initially. When the doors had to be closed shut they finally opened more lanes but by then it was too late. Got through at 11.00 [yes 55 mins, which brings into question the published reports from MAN aiming for 92% of passengers through in <15 min??]. After a brisk 12 min walk (through the horrid commercial tack in T2) trying to find a restaurant, we see on the board we are asked to go to gate at 11.30 [~18 mins from now] hence no breakfast / relax. Thanks MAN - for a thoroughly lousy experience. We made it over the gate via the soul less A wing only to find that they would not in fact be boarding at 11.45, but 12.30. Aer Lingus staff seemed to be clueless and so many of them  sitting around doing nothing, and explains the lack of staff on check in desks pre-security. Overall very disappointing. Morning arrivals to MAN is not much better. On inbound leg, our flight landed at 5.45 am, and T2 has nothing open until after 7 am and even then it is a small coffee shop [all other shops have closed up], so be prepared to stand for 1h+ alongside a 200 yard queue of people waiting for Randox Covid testing to open [also at 7 am], as there are also no seats available. Car rental counters open at 8 on Saturdays, so no other options except hope for your early am flight to land later than published. Welcome to MAN. Typically [in 20+ years experience of MAN] security will take you at least 30 mins door to exit and check in seems to be also very slow, so the notion of being there 3h ahead of an international flight is actually very real [see above]. In my view this defeats the purpose of using a regional airport in the north. I can drive from LHR in less than 4h and the departing / arrivals is fast, professional, and reliable. Even more importantly, with multiple carriers, prices are MUCH cheaper due to competition so think very carefully before using MAN airport."

The signs are somewhat confusing and, as a result of COVID, some of the Information Desks are closed.

Connection times are impossible to make now, with having to be re-routed outside of the secure area to re check-in for connecting flights and then pass through security again. Departing from YVR to MEX, there was one person checking the papers/vaccination etc of over 400 passengers. It was a 2.5 hour process to check in. No one is to be seen anywhere in the airport for help if needed, except for the overstaffed COVID test area where there is an excess of employees standing around directing you to get a test, including police officers. Bathrooms and food areas are disgusting and unclean. The security screening is literally the worst example I have ever seen as a world traveller. The staff are rude, especially the manager that stands around doing nothing. The screening is excessive and illogical, it is almost laughable. Security staff will not let you use your own 1L plastic bag, instead they pull you aside and transfer your stuff to another bag- which is the exact same ziplock bag! Staff are overly picky and power hungry, I witnessed them refuse to screen a passenger because he was trying to make flight and was justifiably angry at the delay, then the agent shut down the screening machine and walked away saying he couldnt concentrate- leaving my bags along with other passengers bags stuck inside the machine, making us all late. On my return, same dismal experience and the agent made me destroy an expensive boxed gift from duty free containing honey pots because they wouldnt fit in the plastic bag. I was not allowed to use a second bag he said. As soon as I said I would not throw any of my belongings out, I was pushed aside so the manager could come over and treat me like a criminal, causing a scene and telling me, ""you want this guy to lose his job? Then do as he says! I actually do hope the manager and the agent lose their jobs because they are not fit for purpose. Border agents on return when 3 international flights landed with hundreds of passengers each - three. Incredibly rude and asked the stupidest questions I have ever heard that had nothing to do with immigration. Then I was randomly selected (tell me how it is random when there is no machine making the selection random, it is the border agent who decides based on what you say) to do a PCR test, having to leave the secure area again and re check in and go through security again in the span of an hour?! The entire Lufthansa crew was left waiting with no one screening them, and the pilot loudly told the border agents how ridiculous the entire process in YVR is, to which everyone there agreed. It was actually embarrassing to know that this is what the first impression of Canada is to all of those travellers and airline staff from around the world. Overall, after travelling from other parts of the world, landing in YVR is like landing in a paranoid pit of incompetence, with staff going off on power trips whenever they can. The security screening needs a complete overhaul."

I understand it is government implemented but there should be some consideration on how to do things better. It is required to take a test before leaving the country you were in to enter Canada (which costs money) & then you get home from traveling - already presenting a negative covid test - only to get through customs & baggage to have a covid test done again. My problem is the fact that they are putting several people in a small area all from different parts of the world to get covid testing which to me seems like a breeding ground for the virus. Im not against stopping the spread but I think there are better ways to ensure we arent spreading it and shoving 100s in a small space does nothing but spread it more. Makes for an extra long day after traveling - especially because being fully vaccinated in a requirement for travel and having a negative covid test already so we should be fine to get through. Sending us home with an at home test would make a lot more sense as there wouldnt be a backed up covid testing line & getting people out of the crammed airport faster.

Not all of us want to prove a point, and we all were ok with wearing the proper mask and thought we were following the proper rules.

Because of this there were 3 seats that could have been used by 3 people in need, but used by the 3 of us who needed to get home. Our flight that we should have been on, had 3 empty seats. Because of this action at the airport 3 of us slept in the airport, was witness to a person walking around nude at 3am in the Orlando airport, waited for security to attend to this poor confused person 25 minutes, and had to fly to Dallas and then from there to Madison WI.

I almost never write reviews for anything but Hartsfield has burnt me so many times that I felt like warning anyone curious. I'm nauseated with paying hundreds of dollars to leave at a specified time and quite literally never once having my end of the deal held up. If you have options, weigh them well."

Terminal B for anyone with a disability is over a one mile walk, require the use of an elevator and wheel chair assistance. On the return flight my son and I had to wheel my parents from check in to terminal B-they were disorganized and understaffed. We told them we were all TSA pre checked but they sent us to the wheelchair lane where we received no priority-had to remove shoes and electronics and coats. Not easy for two 87 year olds in a wheel chair. They separated us through security so my parents had to wait for my son and I to go to the back of the line instead of keeping us all together. For a State who knows how to manage its budget, this new airport represents a lack of thoughtfulness, organization and efficiency. Will find another way to get here and to avoid this airport."

I arrived in the UK from the US, traveling internationally for the first time and was given helpful information from both staff and repeat travelers at Heathrow. Customs was very quick and straightforward, taking less than 20 minutes. I arrived and was picked up from the airport all in under 1 hour which is rather impressive for traveling internationally. Great WiFi connection, ample restrooms and seating and before customs all signage was easy to follow. Signage post customs and by the car park/pick up area was quite hard to follow, but I will possibly lend some of that to being American. I was frustrated by the amount of conveyers out of service, especially for disabled or elderly travelers. Lifts were also a bit tricky to find, especially for the demographics who need them most. Other than that, accessibility is great with many wheelchairs, trollies and services for travelers in need. Just be sure to take your time with navigating the pick up area."

It has been several hours since then, and she is still near tears when she describes her experience. An agent held his hand up in her face to cut her off when she tried to speak to him, and was spoken to both sharply and aggressively when she tried to cooperate. On top of all that, when her bags were thrown in bins to be rescanned, her brand-new neck pillow was jostled loose. Additionally, there was a forgotten black-and-red laptop that sat where it was for over 10 minutes.

I think the worst part of the airport is the small parking. During peak hours, parking can get very limited. The staff really knows how to get you from A-B fast.

First with their incompetent handling and management of construction/expansion that caused delays, missed flights and other problems affecting passengers from all airlines operating out of there. There has been no improvement and the construction is just dragging on now for years with little benefit seen from it. Now, the airport received a light dusting of snow that closed it down numerous times over the Christmas holidays. Canceled flights, delays compounding an already busy system, stranded passengers were the norm and it affected flights from all across the nation. But Seatac has it's cute little food delivery robots getting in passengers ways. How much did that total waste cost? Maybe if that money had been spent on a few more pieces of snow removal equipment the airport could have remained functioning. While it is not often that Seattle gets snow, it does happen regularly, even with global warming. Who ever is in charge of the airport is a total buffoon and incompetent and must be a pay back room appointee. Get someone that knows how to run a large, complicated airport system and not just some lackey looking for the splash of doing the current ""cool"" thing.

Once we passed the secured area I remembered and asked the security guard if I could go back to get my ID. The guard of course didnt speak English and while I was trying to explain I need to get my ID back from desk #1 which was like 50 feet away, I was yelled at by another security guard to go through the TSA check point again and through the Covid line only to get my ID. I said I dont have a boarding pass and cant get through TSA and he said thats your problem! I asked if they could please send someone to get my ID and they said I should go back to delta and ask for a pass to go through TSA which took me in a circle around the airport to get to the Covid screening line. Once at desk #1, the lady who had held my ID, said she had just given it to a security guard and I have to go to their office to get it back. So I had to find where their office was which no one apparently knew where it was, only to get to a desk with two ladies sitting and while I explained my ID shouldve been brought here, they not only didnt help but started answering phone calls with me still standing behind the desk. I had to ask multiple times for someone to please help me so I could go home and that my husband and dog have been waiting outside for me for hours. I havent even mentioned how rude some of the airport staff were and how clueless they were about the airport and how it works. Thai airport system is a disaster.

Let's start with prices. One expects prices to be higher than normal in an airport but Newark has determined to outdo all other airports and even NFL stadiums in this category. $25 for a gin and tonic, $15 for a breakfast burrito (a marginal one at that) are examples of prices experienced. Convenience store items like snacks are priced similarly, knowing that no one would purchase if the price was visible, you never know the price until you check out. I had the pleasure of ordering breakfast at the Grand Bazaar (fancy name for food court). Order food on the tablet, then you are told to go pay elsewhere. Go to another tablet in a different area and pay (with a horribly convoluted process if you are given food vouchers which obviously won't cover the full price of your meal). You are given the option of ""no receipt"" which most opt for (luckily not I) as when you return to where you ordered your food you are required to present proof of payment. I saw that happen a half dozen times in less than 15 minutes. After waiting a very long time, I asked about my order (having already provided proof of payment when called earlier) and was told she could see my order. Interestingly, a container with my order number was sitting right next to her which I pointed out and they then assembled my order. I have to say, McDonalds breakfast burritos are far superior in taste to the one I got. For starters, it mainly consisted of about 6 eggs worth of unseasoned scrambled eggs with part of a sausage link cut up with a couple of small pieces of bell pepper and onion. It came with a side of cut up potatoes with no options for condiments to add flavor. With a career in retail, I've never seen a misalignment of personnel, product and process as bad as this."

Then came the time to get to the gates for departure another trek, again travellators not working and inexplicably its on two levels, no steps or a small lift down, the gate staff were disinterested, no directions as to seating for economy boarding or business, staff sat in a row of priority seats. Access to aircraft down stairs or very thin lift just to get to the skybridge. I have been to so called third world countries with better airport layouts. Manchester is one of the worst travel experiences I have had."

Luckily the lady I did end up with was very kind. The security staff was also incredibly rude and hostile with the way they yelled at people to line up. There was an open slot at the security counter so I went to take the spot when it was my turn and I got yelled at for not waiting until they told me it was OK to take the spot. Ive flown all over the world and Ive never gotten yelled at for taking an empty spot at a security counter. The hostility and tone of voice of the staff was really alarming.

It was nearly a mile walk from Gate B19 to baggage claim and rental cars. They built a brand new airport and had a fresh slate to work from, but the architects and engineers absolutely dropped the ball, in my humble opinion! We will avoid this airport at all costs in the future. We saw so many elderly people resting against the wall during the ultra-long walk to/from the gate. We had our cold weather gear on and were sweating by the time we got to baggage claim! Its extremely sad that so many millions of dollars were wasted on such a poorly designed facility!"

They never have any control of the two different lines, one for citizens and one for non-citizens, that will direct you to the proper federal agent. When you are done with customs, they make you go through the process of re-entering the airport as if you were doing it for the first time. You have to go through the x-ray machine, get padded down, have them go through your carry on and then hope that items that are safe to carry with you are not seen as unsafe by these bunch of idiots and get confiscated. For the individuals running this place common sense is not in their skills set. Apparently they have never heard of six-sigma. They dont have to hire a black-belt to improve the process of making a connecting flight easier and not as stressful as they make it to be. My advice to you is to avoid this airport as much as possible. It has always been the same, organized confusion at its best."

2022-02-02,2022-02-02,7.0,"""a nice airport with lots of amenities"""," |  Newark Airport is underrated - if you know what you're doing. To most travelers, EWR is a very confusing airport with lots of (not so great connections) around the airport. However, once you get the hang of things, EWR is a nice airport with lots of amenities. Getting there, parking is very open most of the time, and most of the time you have to either book 24hrs in advance or go to Short Term parking. They accept multiple forms of payment such as EZ-Pass and credit cards (Terminal C accepts Cash). Getting there on train is also convenient from the city as NJTransit operates to Newark every 15-30 minutes from NY Penn Station. The AirTrain could be down occasionally, so make sure you have time to get to the terminal before your flight. About terminals, Terminal C and B have adequate facilities and places to shop. Terminal A however, is being torn down to make way for Terminal 1 in the future. Terminal A is one of the most dated terminals there is, and I would only recommend flying out of it unless you HAVE to (i.e JetBlue, United Express, Air Canada etc.). Security can be very slow at times at Terminal A (especially during busy hours). Terminal B is the international terminal. This terminal is somewhat dated, however, is way better than Terminal A. Customs are relatively quick here, never had an issue getting through. The last terminal (and where most of EWR's travelers go through) is Terminal C. Terminal C is the best terminal at current hands down. United has modernized this terminal to fit the needs of the modern traveler. The TSA process can be from what I experienced to be anywhere from 5-20 minutes, which isn't that bad. Be warned though, prices do get steep here in terms of retail options and dining options. There is very little cheap food options (besides the Wendy's and Dunkin Donuts, or the Starbucks pre-security), so if you want a good meal, be prepared to shell out some extra cash. Getting to any gate at Terminal C is relatively easy, as if you don't need to walk, there's buggies driving around taxing people through crowds to get to gates. (don't forget to tip them!). So in short from this review, if you're going in Newark, if the trip is a couple bucks extra going out of Newark on United in Terminal C, do it. Terminal C will be your greatest for connections, as well as overall amenities."

You will have to walk through mud, rain, snow and ice to get in and out of that terminal. There is not even a drop off without having to walk for 5-10 minutes through the complete mess. Once you made it to the ""terminal"", don't expect seating anywhere near the ""gate"". Also, don't expect the plane to be anywhere close to the construction zone that you have to enter to catch a flight. For that, you leave the building and walk and walk through the same weather, mud and rain that you experienced getting into that building. I have no idea why any airline in the world would assume that this was anywhere close to acceptable. Over the last 40 years, I have been flying with poor airlines into poor airports, but this is absolutely the worst and most unbelievable experience. For sure the last time that I flew with Delta Airlines, which is the only airline expecting their customers to accept walking through a muddy construction zone to use their ""service"".

Taking the more difficult option of public transport (rental cars, etc.) is penalized by drop-off area furthest from each terminal. Rental car center requires dragging bags across lots, through building and then long wait on huge bus, only to be dropped off on outer land furthest from check-in! Maddening. If you miss turn-off to your terminal (no sign, only colors) be prepared for long delay as you drive miles to other terminal and terminal return. Why a smallish regional airport needs to be spread out over miles of terminal is difficult to comprehend. Its one thing to have to significant transfer between terminals at London Heathrow (giant airport in urban area) its quite another at small regional. How about putting terminals together and allow passengers to access them without driving all over gods green earth. Sorry for the rant but dragging heavy bags for 20 minutes at 5am needlessly requires some decompression."

Newark Facilities couldn't figure out how to connect the terminal ramp to the normal plane, so our deplaning was delayed about 10 minutes. We hustled to the gate of our connecting flight and arrived 8 minutes early. Only to find no one there and the plane gone, while the sign said ""Now Boarding Zone 3"". No announcements about boarding were heard on the fast trot there. Customer Service tells us Newark Facilities (the same clowns that delayed our deplaning) ordered our connecting flight to leave early. Thus between 4.30 to 9.20pm, we were stuck at this place. Good size terminal with many shops, but nowhere to sit down and order a nice dinner from a human and relax. The few shops that sold food, sold the same 12 items or so, at every place. Nothing healthy and nothing gluten free, which we need, just the exact 12 things everywhere. If we wanted to buy chips (potato, Fretos, Doritos, etc.), they had 1000's of options to choose from, but the opposite for every other type of food - it was ridiculous. As a captive market we expect to be gouged at an airport, but this place was by far and away the biggest gouger - triple most airports. $24 for a simple mixed drink, $17 for a small re-made salad or sandwich. No humans to order from, just the same kiosks everywhere, half of which didn't work."

Then I asked at the shuttle if I was in the right place to make sure that I was and the 2 ladies there just point and holler terminal F! Could have just nicely said ""yes this way"". The people working at this airport should really be taught some politeness and customer service. Its ridiculous how they treat people who are just trying to find their gates.

Once in the gate area, there is almost no where to charge electronic devices in the gate areas besides one desk with two electrical outlets. The American Airlines customer service was terrible and had multiple gate changes. The gates in this airport can also be extremely far apart and one gate change took almost 15 minutes to walk to without an easier and accessible way to speed this up such as a walking escalator. I ordered food at Wendys thinking this would be the quickest possible food and gave up waiting for my food after I had been waiting for 30 minutes.

Couldnt find anyone who works there to help find a water fountain.

I don't have a problem paying to park but don't feel like I should have had to pay the full day rate. Don't get me wrong it isn't that I don't have the funds but it really the principle of it. I usually park off site because the rates are better and the shuttle service is better as well. I feel the full day rate shouldn't kick it until about 3 or 4 hours in the garage. I mean if you parked and took a flight somewhere it would take 3 to 4 hours to get there and back without really getting off a plane.

Generally takes 45 min from plane door opening - even with priority status, 1+ hr wait lines to just drop off bags are common - there is only one cross between the terminals. A 15-20 min walk between security/baggage claim and your gate is common - the security tried to be modern and efficient. As a result it's a horrible system with automated trays that takes 2x longer than the normal security setup. Machines can't image 20% of bags through security and have to re scan"

It began by us arriving at 9.30 pm from Costa Rica - over 2 hours late (airplane mechanical issues). No flight reps to meet us to help with tight connections or wheelchair assistance). Lots of etcetera's including zero communications to report but the highlight for us returning to Canada was the closing of the connections lane. This forced everyone into the arrivals long line up that required all persons to take another covid test regardless of our negative molecular tests taken and uploaded just 36 hours before (what happened to random testing?). Almost 100 of us missed our connections even though Air Canada held the planes for an additional 30 minutes to Ottawa, Calgary and Vancouver. We all had to start over at the ticket counter to offload our luggage (even if we hadn't missed our flight we still would have had to do this). Epic nightmare.

I believe the only reason this is horrible is most of the international flights are coming from the Caribbean and South America.

I had no idea where to go which is very stressful for anyone who may have been held up and be in a rush to check in. I wondered if it was just me being stupid but as I hung around trying different lifts / different floors, the people I encountered along the way were also clueless as to where they had to go.

2022-03-10,2022-03-10,1.0,"""incredibly and unexpectedly bad"""," |  It's been a few years since I used SLC. I was excited to experience the new $4.1 billion SLC. However, the experience has been incredibly and unexpectedly bad! First of all, humbly, jugging by my experience, I find it hard to believe that whomever designed the new SLC has ever been in an airport before. SLC is unbelievably the worst airport I've ever experienced in my over 1.5 million miles flown! A 25 minute power walk between security and the gates, really? The tunnel between A and B gates is too narrow for the passenger volume and out of the 3 escalators, 2 are for arriving passengers and 1 is for departing passengers. Here is a tip: It should be the other way around, departing passengers are more likely to have time constraints (such as getting to their gate so they don't miss their flight) than arriving ones. Then coming back it took SLC 1h 9 minutes to deliver my bags beating Madrid's 35 minutes and Paris CDG's little over 30 minutes. There are no seats by the baggage claim area, so plan to be standing for an hour while the bags travel from the gate to the baggage claim. -Finding your way out of the airport is challenging, especially if you're being picked up by a friend or family. I would say that the overall airport signage is the opposite of intuitive (just like in most European airports), but that's a far lesser issue given the other problems. At baggage claim I spoke with the airline staff, they were very nice and apologetic, but clearly frustrated with the airport design and management. They told me it's been like this since they've opened the new SLC in late 2020. Not sure if the SLC leadership reads these reviews or if they're even capable of realizing that maybe it's time to resign? Honestly, I've been in very poor countries and they have far better designed and run airports, costing far less than the $4.1 billion. Hope it gets better next time I use SLC, for now I'm going to avoid it as much as possible."

Try figuring out how to attach an airline label when your brain is not working - another long queue to get the bags on the couple of functional conveyor belts apparently for the whole terminal. Security a complete nightmare, another very lengthy queue, the usual removal of boots as expected but even my little wooly cardigan had to go in a tray. My hand luggage was taken for inspection but nothing unacceptable was found, dont know what that was about. Now half an hour to takeoff and no gate on the screen, but another flight with the same airline and destination was taking off at the same time from the C gates - adjacent to security, so we went there although no catering or duty free. Our gate was displayed twenty minutes before takeoff - a B gate - last call was promptly announced, so we had to sprint back to security and out the other side, through duty free etcetera, a further significant distance, to find seated passengers and yet more waiting for a bus to the plane. The plane took off nearly two hours late, as apparently our bags had been loaded on the flight which left from the C gate and vice versa.

Was shocked to see the queues at check-in/bag drop had filled the terminal area and were two hundred metres down the air bridge. It took two hours to get to the self-bag drop machines which refused to output the required tags for luggage, staff member printed all off separately and got us on our way. Wait, no we then had the joy of a one and a half hour queue for the ski drop scanner - apparently Manchester Airport has only one working scanner and this kept failing - at this point we were already thirty minutes late for take off and had yet to go through Security - another massive queue. Went straight down the fast track (without passes) and told the chap at the end that we were already late for the plane, after a detailed review of our boarding passes he let us through, even though we were then at the front of the queue, it still took a further twenty minutes to get through. Boarded the plane an hour after it should have taken off to find it waiting for the luggage to be loaded and other passengers to get through security. As an encore to this fiasco, we found that some of our luggage had been put on the wrong plane, honestly you could not make this stuff up. Manchester Airports response? ""We had an unexpected number of passengers"". I mean, it's not like the flights were scheduled and booked weeks ago is it. It was the same story on the return flight a week later. We took off three hours late from Innsbruck as the plane originally delayed in, yes you guessed it, Manchester! We landed two and a 1/2 hours late and it then took a further two and a half hours to offload the luggage from the plane. I feel sorry for the staff who have to deal with very frustrated passengers, this is not their fault. Management is non-existent they just keep booking the planes in even though they don't have enough trained check in staff, baggage handlers, security or border control staff. To add insult to injury you have to pay 5 to ""drop off"" passengers at this airport, even though you are stationary for circa sixty seconds, a total rip off."

It is chaos, stressful and inefficient and on top of that now also sort of useless as our passports were not even checked upon reaching the front of the line, we were simply waved through. We transited from international to international twice and the waiting time was close to 3 hours both ways. With just 1 or 2 officers serving the line (and for certain intervals none at all as the officers led passengers to secondary) of up to 500 arriving foreigners it was pure agony to see the time tick away realizing soon our connections would be lost. The foreigners section is shared with the wheelchair passengers and I have never seen so many wheelchair passengers in my life, only when those lines clear an additional officer will serve the waiting foreigners. The previously installed machines where you would do your passport reading, photo and fingerprints are gone, so that option of - sort of - fast tracking is no longer available. And mind you, we are still far away from pre-covid travel volumes. I can only imagine what the situation will be like further in the season. Oh and one more thing, customs is also gone, so that saves you some time. My advice: do not plan any connections under 5 hours. Apart from this, I find DFW a pleasant airport, once you are airside things are spacious, calm and organized. Retail wasn't quite fully operational but the offer seems solid. I especially like entering through the B-terminal that is small scale, with quick and easy security. Once you are in you can reach every terminal quick and easy using the train. Entering the USA as a foreigner has always been hit or miss depending on travel volumes but I would stay away from DFW at this time."

My daughter and I were flying for the first time in a long time and we were appalled at the attitude of the TSA employees, the Bojangles employees, and the market employee. I don't understand how all of the employees throughout this entire airport all share the same negative and rude attitude. What I do understand is that working with the public can be difficult and exhausting. However, the reputation of the Charlotte Douglas Airport should be a consideration, I will do everything in my power from this point on to avoid flying in or out of this airport."

2022-03-20,2022-03-20,1.0,"""Worst airport in the USA"""," |  Worst airport in the USA. This is the second time I have used this Airport in a month. It appears as if international arrivals Airport staff want you to miss your connecting flights. They are unorganized (only a few staff actually do things to help). Then to add more misery to the problems TSA precheck was closed at 8pm on a Saturday. While waiting in the Immigration line many people were discussing how they have missed their flight due to excessively long wait times. I will never have this Airport on my itinerary. If I book a flight and see this Airport on it I will change carriers, change travel times or whatever is necessary to avoid landing here."
2022-03-20,2022-03-20,1.0,"""have never experienced anything like it"""," |  This is the worst airport in the world. I am reasonably well travelled and have never experienced anything like it. The airport security staff all need to go on customer service skills training. They are rude and ignorant, barking orders. On my last ordeal I was reduced to tears. I have a pacemaker so was advised by my consultant to not go through the scanner. I showed my pacemaker card to a female security guard who let me through and then used a paddle to pat me down. Not satisfied with that she then frisked me. She then said she would need to swab me. Then in full view of everybody asked me to lift my jumper whilst she put the swab down the front of my jeans. I felt violated. "

I must say that it is one of the best run mid-tier airports in the country. Beautiful and thoughtful design, airy and welcoming, extremely clean and efficient. The security wait times have always been under 10 mins. Decent food and shopping options too. It's hard to fault this one, just needs to step up when it comes to wifi and entertainment options. Otherwise, it's a great airport."
2022-03-20,2022-03-20,2.0,"""Airport is filthy"""," |  I will leave a couple of tips - Saturday night 3-19-2022 - 1) Airport is filthy - Carpet is horrible and not cleaned. 2) Seats are torn and look like they are from the 80's. 3) No Food or coffee available after 9? - you have Spirit Airlines here, you should think about they are never on time or late so maybe something for the disgruntled passengers something. 4) Maybe, just maybe update to the new century we live in - power and USB charging ports would be a fresh idea? Just some helpful tips for you!"
2022-03-21,2022-03-21,1.0,"""not be using this airport any more""","  |  I will not be using this airport any more. Its complete chaos, not sure who the CEO is but he/she needs to go! Cues for check in where so long they were leading into the walkway from Terminal 1 to terminal 2. The travellators in the connection walk-way not working either on the way there or the way back. Cues for security were out the door! Even with fast track it took far to long. Unfortunately, each time I have used this airport I tell myself I will never use it again. but this time has to be the last straw. Read a release on my holiday saying they had more people arrive at the airport then expected. How is this possible, and then then a simple ""sorry"" for the delays with security. I personally don't think this is good enough and will show with my feet by using a different airport next time I fly. Dropping someone off costs 5, you have to pay for a trolley for your baggage! Don't fall into the trap of thinking it is convenient to where you live. Its badly run and not a good start to any journey, be it for business or pleasure."
2022-03-21,2022-03-21,1.0,"""ghastly experience""","  | I am curious to know why, with all the available information world wide, Terminal 5 design is not fit for purpose. A truly ghastly experience on our return. Long walks, long queues, rude immigration staff, long waits for baggage."
2022-03-22,2022-03-22,1.0,"""They literally sell fifteen kinds of water in this spirit""", |  They literally sell fifteen kinds of water in this spirit and no sparkling. None. All these different kinds of water are marketing ripoffs. Surely you could manage a perion somewhere in there. One damn bottle. Also not a bag of pretzels. Three hundred kinds of the same thing is not choice. Come on!
2022-03-22,2022-03-22,2.0,"""I feel service can be improved"""," |  So first time in a while that I've been to this airport. I got a little turned around and looked everywhere for someone to help, unfortunately everyone ignored me. Finally I went up to a desk and asked the lady attending the Hawaii desk and asked my question. She treated me rather rudely and cold. Don't usually leave reviews unless I feel service can be improved and I think it should be. Also have an anonymous tip line, it makes it easier."

But not at this sorry excuse that masquerades as a top Canadian international airport (working hand in hand with gov't, no doubt). Pearson still can't figure out how to manage arriving queues. So now they force people to sit for an hour on a plane after an 8- hour flight, without letting us disembark, because they can't get their act together. If I see any more awards for this place, I'm going to puke."

Horrible security staff. He had no consideration for customers. People missed their flights. I understand there may be staffing issues due to recent events but there is no need for customers to be treated so appallingly.
