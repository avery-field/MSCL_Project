2017-06-02,2017-06-02,3.0,"""force people to take the bus""","Seems the Fort Lauderdale airport officials want to force people to take the bus when moving among the different terminals since there are very few signs directing those who wish to walk. To encourage walking it would be helpful to have signs indicating the path and the approximate walking time. Example, 'This way to Terminal 1', 'Walking time 14 minutes'. Or you may choose to take the bus."

They were very understanding, and I am still to this day shocked given my experience with the TSA at O'Hare. WiFi was ok. The decor was quite tasteful."
2017-06-11,2017-06-11,1.0,"""utter chaos inside"""," Verified Review | Arrived at Vancouver after a good flight from UK to be informed that all transit passengers would have to collect thier own luggage and check in again for their onward journey. I had 2 hours and 35 minutes before my next flight to Calgary, plenty of time, I thought. After disemabarking from my flight we were faced with total and utter chaos inside the airport, in fact it was more akin to a cattle market. In my 40 years of world travel and visiting both large and small airports, this was my worst experience at any time, anywhere. All the ""assistants"" were young girls who were far to busy on their intercom phones to talk with anyone, they just pointed where we all had to go. It was some 1 hour and 45 minutes later that I managed to get into the main hall (downstairs) to retrieve my luggage. I was then informed that I had to go through security before I could check in for my onward journey to Calgary. This I have never ever known before and there was now only 50 minutes before my next flight. Of course there was yet another long queue for the security. Many travellers (some quite older people) were trying to ask the young staff if they would miss there onward flight, their reply was always the same ""there is nothing we can do, just keep in the queue"". There was nowhere for these older people to sit and rest and most were just being pushed along, this was not a nice thing to see. Eventually, near the end of the queue I could see that the Immigration officers were sitting and there was not a single person in the queue? I just could not see why we were queuing at all until, I saw some machines. These machines were now quiet obviously the issue that was causing all the chaos. Thousands of people and only a few machines to service all passengers, and of course it was very plain to see that most passengers were having issues in working these machines and there was not one member of airport staff to assist anywhere to be seen. I finally reached the machines, in fact they are now the declaration machines. I am very competent with computers and I could see why people were now having issues. There was one question at a time on the screen and right at the very bottom it says continue, most did not see this were just looking around the screen and looking for some help. Alas, there was no forthcoming save from the odd passenger, myself included who showed them how these machines operated. There were no clear instructions anywhere. Disguting design in my opinion. Eventully I filled in the declaration and form the machine I recieved a ticket. I then rushed to the nearest Immigration officer as I had 10 minutes left to check in and get to the boarding gate. The officer just looked at my passport and said have a good holiday and let me through very quickly. I then look at three different boards for my Flight number and boarding gate. It is only now that I am beggining to feel totally frustrated at the lack of staff around to assist. I went from one end of the check in right down to the other end and there was no check in for Air Transat to be found. Now with only 5 minutes left before my flight it was due to another passenger who waved at me and showed me where the check in was. It was tucked away right at the very end hidden around a corner. I just made my flight, others unfortunately did not. I shall never fly to this airport again.The whole experience and the way passengers were treated was utterly disguting."
2017-06-12,2017-06-12,1.0,"""most unorganized airport"""," Verified Review | Honolulu has been one of the worst airport experiences of my life. I flew in on an international flight and was told I had to get my bag, recheck it, and then go through security again. There were signs to mainland USA, but when I got to the sign where it said to take the elevator, there was no floor number to go to. So I just had to pick a floor. When I finally found Hawaiian check-in there was just one huge queue. No one knew what they were doing, half of the check in computers were not working, and then I couldn't even get a seat number when I dropped my bag off. Then security took 45 minutes, and the line was not that long. Finally got through security and had to walk a mile to find my gate. These sound like little things, but this was the most unorganized airport I've ever been to. I will try at all costs to never fly through here or use Hawaiian Airlines again."
2017-06-13,2017-06-13,1.0,"""airport doesn't have the capacity""", Verified Review | Vancouver airport is a failure! The staff have no clue how to handle the crowds. Lines are very long and the airport doesn't have the capacity to service this number of flights. It seems for the managers increasing the number of flights is more important than the quality of the service. The picture is the passport check at the arrivals.
2017-06-14,2017-06-14,10.0,"""improved markedly"""," Verified Review | We flew from Terminal 3, the base for United's domestic operations. Things have improved markedly at San Francisco over the past couple of years. Terminal 3 has been thoroughly modernized and has many state-of-the-art features. United's clubs, at gate 69 and in the satellite concourse, are both among their better clubs. Check-in is well-spaced and efficient. Security, long a problem for Terminal 3, seems to have been configured to move quickly. We were flying at midday and experienced no wait at TSA Pre-check. As an aside, I'm also familiar with SFO's international concourses. They are among the best in the US, with lots of facilities and efficient boarding areas."
2017-06-14,2017-06-14,1.0,"""avoiding this airport indefinitely"""," Verified Review | Fort Lauderdale airport is by far the worst I have ever been in. Baggage claim area is a joke. There were about 500 people in a cramped area with 2 area to get your luggage. Asking for assistance by their employees was a joke. They were extremely rude and discourteous. 2 hours to get through customs. Customs agents were rude. Everyone seems unhappy to work there. We arrived 20 mins early at 4:20 and was not finished through customs until a little after 6pm and our next flight begins boarding at 6:30. I will be willing to pay more money for better service and treatment. Therefore, I will be avoiding this airport indefinitely."

Efficient ground ops and control, great amenities, extremely logical and convenient layout, tall ceilings and huge windows. I fly several times per month and Dallas Fort-Worth is my preferred airport hands down. It's easy to park here too which is a feat for such a large airport. Minus one until they finish remodeling the last one or two terminals."

In addition to almost all areas being nasty, 80% of oulets for traveler convenience do not work. Door security alarms go off so often that no one cares or pays attention. Seven times so far in the span of 2 hours. Horrendous place to be stuck for more than 30 minutes. American airline employee apathy ca be cut with a knife it's so thick. From gate agents all the way up to the Admiral club counter. Welcome to FPA."
2017-06-19,2017-06-19,2.0,"""horrible, inexcusable delays"""," Unverified |  I have never found Logan Airport to be efficient or well-run. It's runway renovations are causing horrible, inexcusable delays. I am sitting on a Dallas runway waiting to take off to Boston on a Sunday morning and we have already been delayed twice. Three weeks ago, I experienced a six hour delay due to this same thing. I am going to start driving to RI or other airports rather than waste time trying to use Logan. Colleagues of mine in Boston are also doing the same."
2017-06-22,2017-06-22,3.0,"""gate seating area is inadequate"""," Verified Review |  I'm sitting in the B gates area now waiting out a 3 hour weather delay. The women's restroom for all B gates only has 3 stalls. There was no soap, paper towels, or toilet paper. Southwest has put in charging stations, but the actual airport offers few, if any. To get to nicer food or restroom options, be prepared to leave security and be re screened in order to get to your flight. The gate seating area is inadequate for a full flight of passengers. Be prepared to camp out on the floor."
2017-06-24,2017-06-24,3.0,"""they have no wifi"""," Verified Review |  It's 2017 and they have no wifi. Upon my arrival, I inquired at an info desk and was told they are currently installing wifi. Upon my departure, I experienced rude and unprofessional ""welcomes"" at four restaurants, including: PGA Tour Grill, California Pizza Kitchen, Gordon Biersch, and The Local at HNL. I walked away from all of them, finding a very professional young man working at Burger King. I arrived at 6 pm and 80% of the stores were closed."
2017-06-26,2017-06-26,4.0,"""certainly not user friendly"""," Verified Review |  Looked beautiful but certainly not user friendly for those requiring assistance. We arrived with plenty of time for our flight, using a lounge prepared for post-cruise use at the Fairmont. Moving from the hotel to Delta's ticket area was easy as was check in. I was surprised that the passenger was required to move their luggage to the screening area - and then load it as the gentleman watching the operation refused to assist. We were able to obtain a pusher for my wife's wheelchair easily. She was friendly for the more than 40 minute wait to go through security. Seems Canadian security decided that only one screening position was required for strollers and wheelchairs. The entire process was glacial, maybe even slower as there were maybe thirty people in line. Each wheelchair, ours provided by the airport, was inspected as if it was an annual maintenance check. The area immediately after passing through the passenger screening check point looked like a demolition derby of strollers and wheelchairs with screeners doing more thorough inspections and passengers trying to collect their bags, belts and shoes from the mass of items packed into a mess. Finally clearing dis-functional junction, we broke into the clear for a smooth transit through US immigration and customs before transiting the usually duty free goods tunnel of shopping bliss, then a several hundred yard walk to Gate 90. The gate area reminded me of the Delta small plane area at JFK - crowded, uncomfortable, and seemingly more temporary than permanent in nature. The lady who spent the better part of an hour assisting my wife was pleasant and most helpful as was the Delta gate agent. Having to move and load your bags after checking in with your airline then waiting for security screening solely because you require assistance made for a rather poor impression."
2017-06-27,2017-06-27,8.0,"""through security in less than 10 minutes"""," Unverified |7.30am departure on Air Canada in La Guardia Terminal B on a Monday morning could have been an anxious experience but it was shockingly smooth. We were through security in less than 10 minutes. The A gate area is small, but there was seating for all and food options available with short queues at 6.30am. There was even a tiny duty free shop open. 30min of free wifi is available and worked fine."
2017-06-30,2017-06-30,9.0,"""very cool and hip experience"""," Verified Review | A few months ago I've heard of a brand-spanking new high-tech Terminal C North was constructed at Houston and I was very pleased that my flight was there. This was the terminal of the future. The design was very modern and clean. Blue LED mood lighting filled up the whole terminal much like the one in the 787 Dreamliner. The terminal is huge with very high ceilings. The restrooms were like I was in a five-star hotel - very modern and clean and big. There was a nice selection of food and beverages to choose from. The restaurants were not your typical Mcdonalds (no McDonalds at IAH anymore though) or Subway restaurants rather they were the specialty, high-quality local restaurants that made it all the more special. There was also a decent amount of shops to choose from though I felt there too many selling the same things: souveniers, neck pillows, and magazines. What really got the kick out of my Terminal C North experience was the seating. They were not your typical airport seats rather they were leather and very cushioned armchairs and in front of you a table with charging ports and an iPad. Yes, an iPad in every seat! You can do countless things with the tablet to get you occupied such as games, access to the Internet browser, shopping, magazines and you can order food and drinks from it! Very cool and hip experience at Terminal C North and I can't wait to be there again!"
2017-07-01,2017-07-01,1.0,"""a lack of available seating"""," Verified Review | I have connected several times at Charlotte Airport in 2017. At least in Terminals B and E, there is a lack of available seating coupled with a lack of places to charge electronic devices/work while waiting for your next flight. At 9 am, I am currently sitting on the floor between terminals. The bathrooms are also showing their age and the smells are not inviting. The bathroom attendant helps but the problems in the bathrooms go much deeper than an attendant can solve. The carpets in the terminal should be ripped up and replaced with tile or a hard surface. For a city with so many affluent bankers, this airport is not measuring up."
2017-07-02,2017-07-02,5.0,"""TSA is a total joke"""," Unverified |  TSA is a total joke. Every other airport I've been to has automatic belts to carry your belongings through the scanners. These idiots make you push everything straight into the scanner and then get in an unorganized line to pass through the x-ray. If you're unaware you need to push your things, they confiscate them. What other airport does this? Have a question for TSA? Good luck getting it answered. They'll just glare at you and move on. They'll let your ""random"" bag selected for extra screening sit for 10 minutes while they stand around talking. I pray to god I never have to deal with this again. Overall the airport wasn't bad, but those staff in security need to figure something out."
2017-07-07,2017-07-07,2.0,"""Baggage Claim area was abysmal"""," Unverified |  Baggage Claim area was abysmal. Frontier Airlines from COS arrived with info that bags would be on 4. No signs were at Carousel 4, but they were switched to 5. Bags came from 5, but stopped before the last bags came out. Someone noticed a flashing yellow light. No one was in the area to assist. Delta said the problem was Frontier's not theirs and we'd have to go to the ticket counter. The info counter person said she didn't have a phone and couldn't call. She has a phone. Frontier ticket counter said it's not their problem, the carousels belong to the City of Phoenix. City of Phoenix said that the carousel doesn't stop unless there's a jam and that's Frontier's problem. After about 45 minutes of this a Frontier ticket agent went into an elevator and got someone to finally react. Some mysterious guy apparently pushed on the flashing yellow light and the belts started moving. This shouldn't happen at what is claimed to be a Friendly Airport. Someone should be available to assure the carousels are working properly, regardless of which airline is using them. Bad experience."

2017-07-09,2017-07-09,1.0,"""A miserable experience"""," Verified Review |  One of the worst airports in the developed world. There was a two-mile long line to get into the airport with no reserved lane for taxis (the cab driver told that it was always like that). There was a 40 minute waiting time for clearing security (even if I went through priority lane, just to find it took some time because it was poorly indicated). The terminal was overcrowded with very little seating. Air conditioning was almost absent. Third rate shopping and eating/drinking. No Wifi. A miserable experience."

It doesn't appear to have been planned but seems to have grown randomly like a snake firework from the 4th of July. You have to be in pretty good shape to comfortably hike from one point to another with your carry-on, personal item and whatever else in tow. The whole thing should be razed and rebuilt."

The time to retrieve your luggage is consistently the longest of any airport that I visit which is over 50 different airports. The airport itself gets a good rating except in the baggage handling area. The low rating for airport staff is specifically for the baggage handling department."
2017-07-14,2017-07-14,1.0,"""airport has gone downhill fast"""," Verified Review | Charlotte airport has gone downhill fast. I understand they are growing but it is an absolute nightmare to navigate. Every concourse is overcrowded. The air rarely works well. Bathrooms are disgusting and feel like you're in an old gym locker room. Staff are the most discourteous I've experienced and I'm in airports every week. I've been knocked over, pushed, and had my bag knocked off of my arm multiple times trying to get to my gate. It's everything everyone dreads about travel these days."
2017-07-15,2017-07-15,5.0,"""Deeply disappointed"""," Unverified |    I am unhappy with this airport. First of all, the staff at the terminal C Jetblue counter are rude and don't tell you whether or not your bag is overweight. They also seem to not know what gate flights are at. Deeply disappointed, though wifi is good. Unfortunately, I have to fly through Logan once a year."
2017-07-17,2017-07-17,1.0,"""the worst major airport in America"""," Verified Review | If you like having zero options for food (or paying $10 for a cold and stale sandwich), having to go through security to use the bathroom, and being in extremely close proximity to people going through security checks as you connect to your next flight, Kansas City Airport is the place for you. This is easily the worst major airport I've ever been to. There are only two restaurants, and both somehow seemed like 1 and 1A for the title of ""Saddest Place on Earth"". When your best food option is a microwaved sandwich from Starbucks, you know you're in a whole new level of suck. Also, for some odd reason, half of the airport is walled off and is inaccessible to the general populous. Why? Good question. This isn't Westeros. I have heard from locals that the airport provides easy in and out access, which could possibly be true. But the fact that this place hasn't been updated since the 70's is incredible, and the shocking lack of restaurants and cleanly bathrooms make Kansas City International seem like the worst major airport in America."
2017-07-20,2017-07-20,5.0,"""parking/transportation departments are dreadful"""," Verified Review |  As is typical, any effort to park in a lot at DFW is rewarded with frustration. For years now, I have tried to avoid parking here at all costs. Shuttle bus service is erratic, and drivers routinely ignore passengers waiting. Lot attendants are typically rude and standoffish. Unfortunately on my last trip, there was no Uber available at 4am, and I had to drive and park at DFW. When I returned to DFW a week later, the Remote South bus pulled up near the stop, the driver looked at me as I waved, and just continued on. This has happened to me multiple times over the past two years, either in the lot or at the terminal pickup stop. Drivers stare at you, ignore, and roll on by. This time I had to wait another 15 minutes in 100 degree heat with my wife and two young children. DFW may be well run in some areas, but their parking/transportation departments are dreadful. No sense of customer service whatsoever."

Terminal 1, dominated by Southwest, is open, clean, and inviting. There were no lines at security, and I went through the TSA line within five minutes. The terminal was easy to navigate, with plenty of open space and updated arrival and departure screens for the various flights.

Their Spirit flight from Chicago is arriving at least one hour late. I am told the only place to wait for arriving passengers is near baggage claim. There is a woman there, apparently doing nothing, in a kind of uniform wearing a badge reading something like ""passenger assistant"". I ask her where to find an arrivals monitor. She laughs and says: ""there are no such monitors here"". I ask where to find them elsewhere, she says ""there are only departures monitors"". I express my surprise, she keeps laughing and she says ""this is how this airport is right now"". Then I ask her to please find information about Spirit 630, she laughs again and says ""it's impossible"". Then I wander about the airport, finally spotting, on the floor above, an arrivals monitor. The arrival appears to be imminent, so I go downstairs not to miss my daughter. Of course I still don't know whether the plane has landed. The woman is still there doing nothing."

Please note that the temperature outside when we arrived at the airport was 100+. I brought a bottle to refill with water. Both drinking fountains near the gate were inoperable. I walked further down the terminal and came to 4 other drinking fountains. Nothing but a dribble came out. It was hard enough to get a sip of water but was impossible to fill up a bottle. This is ridiculous and leads me to believe you are forcing me to spend $3 on a bottle of water. It is time to update your fountains, first with ones that work and secondly with the bottle fillers that are offered in most 21st century airports. Secondly, the men's room near gate A2 had 4 soap dispensers none of which had any soap. These issues don't reflect the airport or the city of St Louis in a very good light."

We had to backtrack 15 or 20 gates and go up one level to the people mover to get to the balance of the C gates.
2017-07-26,2017-07-26,3.0,"""no bathroom facilities for 4 legged friends"""," Unverified |I was a passenger on a Jetblue flight to Boston. The flight was originally scheduled to leave FLL at 4:06 p. m., arriving at Boston Logan shortly after 7:00 p.m. However, inclement weather in the NY/NJ area caused what turned out to be a four hour + delay. Although an inconvenience, I understand that these things happen. Traveling with me was my eight pound Yorkshire Terrier. She travels in a Jetblue crate, and sits under the seat in front of me. She is considered one of my carry ons, and the charge for her is $100.00 each way. What I do not understand, however, is why there is nowhere within the terminal for dogs to relieve themselves? During my delay, I was forced to take my dog outside a total of three times, and go through security a total of three times! I feel this is unacceptable, and, with more and more people flying with dogs/cats, cannot fathom why there is no bathroom facilities provided for our four legged friends. Believe that a ""hydrant"" area has recently opened in terminal one, and feel the same facilities should be provided in each of the FLL terminals."

Our luggage carousel had three flights of luggage on it from three different cities. On return trip the airport was deserted at 3 pm. My biggest complaint is the men's restrooms on Concourse D were filthy. Some urinals (perhaps 1/3) were out of service. There was an attendant floating around that did not appear to be doing much to improve the situation. I was appalled at how bad the floors were. Wi-Fi had advertising from a financial brokerage frim and I really did not trust it a lot.

2017-07-30,2017-07-30,3.0,"""has always been a tough place to get around"""," Verified Review |  Charlotte airport has always been a tough place to get around. You generally always have to go from one end of one terminal to the end of another. Handicapped individuals used to reliably depend on the Club Car to pick them up and take them to their destination. You sat in a designated spot and they would pick you up. However, now probably for some politically correct reason, the Club Cars no longer run. They have been replaced by men and women who will push you in a chair to where you are going. However, the sit and wait in the designated chairs no longer works. I sat for 25 minutes and watched empty chair after empty chair walk by me. Some looked at me, but just walked on by. If the airport was bad before [high priced restaurants and ling distances to walk with intermittent functioning if the skywalks] it is now even crueler."

I'm a citizen and have never waited so long for a stamp in any of the dozens of countries I've travelled - except now my own thanks to San Francisco. It was an hour in line, with equally exhausted and upset people. I looked over and saw the visitor line was 4x longer, meaning they stood for 2 or more hours for a stamp. Welcome to America? Not cool! After finally getting stamped, I was at baggage claim for an hour and a half. Some people 2 hours to get their bags, again, first time ever for me. 2.5 with no water or toilet as a single traveler you don't want to leave baggage area thinking your bag is coming out - but 1.5 hours later it finally does. I felt so embarrassed that this chaos is the very first impress for visitors and I missed 2 airport busses myself.

We had a 2.5-hour layover for a connecting flight to New Orleans. We have made round trips from the US to Italy for 35 years, and we have never had such a long delay in passing through US Immigration. There were at least 500 people in line, and there were only 7 agents checking passports. There were about 20 passport kiosks for do-it-yourself scan of passport, finger prints, etc. After about an hour, we made it to the Kiosk; then about another 45 minutes to the agent who repeated the same procedure himself that we had already done at the kiosk. The process couldn't have been more confusing and when I finally said something to an airport courtesy worker, she said ""we make no promises"". We barely made our connecting flight. They were closing the door. Many in line were for more than one hour after their connecting flights were due to depart. In short, avoid this airport until changes are made.

My flight was to depart at 715 AM, and I arrived at the airport at 515 AM. I used the luggage valet, which meant that they took care of the agriculture screen and checking the bags. (Well worth the tip as a side note, no time spent with checking the bags). I have TSA pre-check and flew first class for this flight. I waited in a security line labelled TSA pre-check, which was approx. 20 yards long. After 10 minute wait, a staff member came to us and told us to move to another area to wait, and assured me that there also was a TSA pre-check. Once I walked 40 yards to get to the new area, one had to enter through a door, and encountered another member of staff. She rudely said ""no separate for pre-check"". The line was long and winding, and since 20-30 showed up more after us, there was now going back to the original line. We did not want this somewhat inefficient experience to ruin our Hawaii vacation, so we patiently waited. After 20 minutes of wait, a group of 20-30 travellers showed up. Since there were so many of them, the security staff decided to open up a new line and let these folks essentially go to the front of the line! The staff said this was being done to move the lines along. What about those of us with Pre-check, who showed up 2 hours earlier, patiently waiting in line? What is maddening the most, is the complete lack of organization. No preferential treatment for people who were waiting in line, no preferential treatment for TSA pre-check, etc. The line is being managed by someone who could care less about customer service or fairness. Really leaves a bad taste upon leaving after a Hawaii vacation. Honolulu Airport authority needs to seriously look at how they run their services at peak times."

It was the departure that was frustrating. We made it to the airport in good time - about an hour before take-off, made it through the first ID and boarding pass check quickly. Then the security bit. The TSA agents were flat out rude. Not only were they getting frustrated and unnecessarily annoyed with a woman who clearly did not speak English (after they asked her to do something 4 or 5 times and then getting progressively angry with her I finally had to tell them she obviously doesn't understand), but there were tons of them doing absolutely nothing. Both our bags were held because I had saline solution that I knew needed to be tested and my partner forgot he had carried in our water bottle. We and 2 or 3 other folks sat at the end at the security check point for (and this is a rough estimation) about 10-15 minutes before anyone started checking bags, but there were security people sitting around. Talking with each other. Standing around. And all the while our plane is about ready to begin boarding. I was furious. After waiting another 5-10 minutes for our bags to be checked and for my partner to go through security (a second time) with their water bottle we were finally able to make it to our gate. The guy who looked through our bag was nice, but it was like no one knew what their job was that day! Overall I hope I never have to fly out of this airport again.

We had to go outside the terminal to be confronted with no signage and lot of lines seemingly going nowhere. Immigration and customs had already taken an hour, we had only a 2 hour gap between flights. Eventually nearly in tears we found a lovely lady from HA who took our bags from us and told us to run to the security line which we did, then another sprint to the gate.

The signage was so poor that you literally have to walk around in circles looking for your gate. The walls are plain and white. Although the airports of Halifax and Ottawa are smaller, they are at least aesthetically pleasing and have affordable options for food. Paid $39 in Montreal for a pint of beer and a poutine, ridiculous.

I understand this is only for Air Canada flights, but what a difference it makes. Because delays are usual these days, connections are often tight and line-ups at customs and security can be daunting with tight time frames. This has made such a difference! It is finally a truly customer-centred response. Yay for Air Canada in instituting this. It also means I do not have to discard my water bottle and buy another one after security. Question: can you please institute this thru Toronto, too? And also going in the other direction - Halifax- Montreal - La Guardia.

I have not flown a lot in my life but when I do I usually have 18+ hour journeys. As a citizen of the United States, it is nice to come back after a few years. Well, after an eight hour flight over the ocean, the first thing you are met with is passport control. I have to say that the TSA, guards and police who work there are some of the most unhappy, unhelpful, and rude people I have ever had the mispleasure of interacting with. There were many lines and unclear, sometimes conflicting instructions. We were met with a man who did nothing but treat everyone like an animal, yelling and being rude to people who were confused. Even after the handful of times I have flown, flying and airports are still daunting and I feel sorry for the people who are first time flyers or tourists who will be met with this the first time they are in the country. In May, when I arrived with my boyfriend from a European country, we were met with hostility. When attempting to go through the line, they asked if we were family, if we were from the same household, which we were. The woman simply barked at us that we were indeed not together or family before we could even say anything. She then told her colleague to not help us because we were trying to get through the line faster. We were separated, he needed to be pulled to another line and I was forced to wait at least an hour on the other side. Needless to say we missed our next flight. I've never been so poorly treated in my life. These people should be ashamed of themselves. I understand they have an important job to do but there is no excuse for being so hateful and so rude to people, most of which are confused or afraid. We were almost in tears by the time the process was over. This airport was a stark contrast to the previous in London which was quick, painless and effective. Charlotte Douglas is anything but. On a brighter note, after we got through security, we talked to a woman to rebook our flight and she was very nice and very helpful.

I experienced the same problems at the North Terminal as these posters had observed at the South Terminal! Firstly, on arriving from Basel, I had the luxury of a jet way from the aircraft to the terminal, but then discovered that our gate was practically the furthest from border control. It's quite illuminating and discouraging to see signs telling you how far in metres you had to walk, approximately how many minutes that would take you, and that there would be seats and toilets available to you on your journey! The next event was crossing the apron on the sky-bridge and the horrible rain forest sound effects from the speakers as you did so. What happened to good, old-fashioned silence? Perhaps that's why you need to know that you'll be passing toilets on your expedition from the lawless outer reaches to the relative promise of civilisation after transiting border control! On reaching border control, there was a dense throng of passengers for all methods of entry. It took about 40 minutes to be processed, but I am grateful that the officer who checked my passport was charming and courteous. Signage could be better for the exit and the shuttle to the South terminal as plenty of people asked me for help and this was my first time to Gatwick for many years. On my return, security was reasonably straightforward with minimal wait, but then I was thrust into a glittery floored shopping arcade worthy of Stansted and Manchester and as far as I know, Gatwick is not owned by MAG. Horrible lighting, low ceilings, no easy way through, running the gauntlet of the perfume sprayers. I did buy some chocolate from the World Duty Free after having pointed out that my preferred purchase was out of its sell-by date and when I did buy a couple of smaller bars, I found that WHSmith was offering the same product on a 3 for 2 basis so I had poor value for money. The restaurants (sorry, fast food outlets) were all upstairs and grubby and disappointing. My flight had been delayed so I chose Garfunkel's, and was served by kind folk who allowed me to relax over my meal rather than pushing me out to turn tables. That I was grateful for. I will be passing through Gatwick more frequently in the future than I might have wished, and based on my recent experience, I will have to try to spend as little time there as possible. Even the jet-way to the plane was dirty, and had litter on the floor and stuck to the walls. A poor impression of the UK.

After asking 3 staff members for assistance and receiving only grunts in response, I finally found the correct bag check area. It was a complicated self check process that took even tech savvy people upwards of 20 minutes to properly navigate. Then we were ushered back outside into a pre-security line that didn't move for 30 minutes because they didn't have enough staff available! By this point our flight was about to board! Staff were sarcastic and unsympathetic, remarking that we'd ""better hurry and run."" I've been to third world countries that have easier and more effiecient airports than Honolulu."

We asked what to do and were advised we would need to return to north terminal to the ticket desk. As my partner is disabled we requested assistance, after 1 hour no one arrived we requested several times and were advised someone was on their way. On the final request we were advised to flag down a buggy ourselves! Great service! We got our way back to the 'Airline Desk' and again explained our situation and were advised we would need to go back to check in area. We again requested assistance to a lady and she said she would arrange it (my partner uses 2 crutches), same again sat for ages and kept being told someone was on their way. Eventually after another hour a lady arrived and an older gentlemen came over and told us to follow this lady, we again enquiried if assistance was coming and the guy stated no, no one had been called as he was not aware we needed assistance! He was so rude, ignorant and for the fact we were pressed for time I would've addressed the issue with him. In the end we had to walk for a further 20 mins to the desk, the lady at Aer Lingus was very nice and checked in all our bags and gave us our new boarding passes. She was aware of our situation and had been waiting on us arriving. The staff who man this 'Airline Desk' should be ashamed of themselves for their actions. I've complained to Gatwick but they cannot give me any contact details for this Airline desk or who is in charge of it. This whole issue is and was a total disgrace."

It took less than half an hour to get out and that's only because we had to wait a little bit for our bags. There was a bit of an issue with renting a car but we didn't have a reservation so it took some time to find an available rental. Overall, very happy with the arrival process at this airport."

While I appreciate that they do a vital job for the safety of all of us, and they are under a lot of pressure, the security staff at terminal A were rude and unhelpful today. I was told off by one staff member for leaving one item in my pocket, as if I were already under some sort of investigation. It was a clear plastic wallet containing money, which I did not want exposed to public glare. I then found four trays of my belongings piling up at the end of the runners tipping over, being pushed by the following trays, risking my laptop, kindle and phone being sent crashing to the floor. I had to grab them and was left with an empty tray to get rid of, with nowhere to put it, and no staff offering to help. My reaction was to throw it back onto the runners as I felt I had no other choice, and the staff thought I was throwing it at them. I admit my reaction was not the best one, but I felt pushed into a corner by the staff doing nothing to help me and being rather aggressive. When I asked where I could go to sort my things out the answer was ""I dunno, get outta here"". Unhelpful, rude. This contrasts markedly with the courtesy, helpfulness, and friendliness of everybody else we have met in Boston, including strangers. It also contrasts with the attitude of security staff at other airports I have travelled from recently, such as London Heathrow, Arrecife Lanzarote and Gibraltar. I apologise for my own reaction, but may I respectfully suggest your terminal A security staff undergo some more training in how to be constructively helpful and courteous?"

Anecdotally, others have said the same thing. In fairness to Gatwick, outgoing security efficiency has improved in my experience over the past few years and one rarely has to wait more than five minutes to get through. Border Control on return is a different matter and baggage reclaim has a justifiable reputation for its tardiness. But then generally it takes ages to get through Border Control so maybe they figure what's the rush? After we leave the EU, goodness knows what a muddle the arrival process will be. You can be certain there will be teething problems. Probably caused by introducing new processes over an Easter weekend when the place is at its busiest. Most UK airports are the embodiment of Rip off Britain. No opportunity to pick your pocket is wasted from parking charges that would make a footpad blush, to funnelling you through horrible duty free malls and having nowhere quiet to sit, the experience is rarely serene. Gatwick is no exception, I can put up with that but not Gatwick's deteriorating punctuality and seemingly indifferent attitude to speeding up the arrivals process and getting out of the place as soon as possible."

"," Verified Review |  I prefer to use Fort Lauderdale international for my trips over Miami International for a number of reasons, but primarily parking and getting in/out of the airport. I generally do not fly in/out of this airport on international trips as I'll go with an airline that has connections in one of their hubs: typically Atlanta or New York. So I cannot comment on the experience coming through customs at the international terminal. I live in South Florida and they are building a new international terminal, so perhaps the experiences will be improved after that. At peak times it can get very congested and if you're picking up a UBER ride (which has become more popular), the space allotted for them is not large, so that can be a hassle identifying your ride. Communication between you and the driver is key. The terminals I fly through are quite clean (terminals 1 and 2 primarily, and occasionally 30), the security lines can be slow at times, so I always get to the airport 1.5 to 2 hours ahead of my flight. Food selection is OK, and if you're leaving on a late flight, your options may be limited. Parking is pretty good as they have some large parking garages, but if you're parking when it's a holiday or peak travel days, you may be forced to park in one of the remote lots, that's a real hassle. Plan ahead and get there even earlier if that's the case. As for friendliness of staff at the airport, that's pretty much a premium. But despite all of this, I much prefer to fly out of FTL over MIA."

He mentioned how it was ridiculous that an airport of their size wasn't prepared for our arrival. When we finally disembarked an hour later, we entered the worst immigration queues I have ever had the misfortune of standing in. Two and a half hours it took, in a room with no air conditioning. We had a toddler that didn't understand what was going on and almost collapsed in the heat. No one was offering water or seats, just warnings that phones must be kept in pockets. To add insult to injury we had to endure the constant repeating of the flash entry video about how easy they make immigration. It was inhumane how they treated people, coming into their country to spend a lot of money. Eventually we got to baggage claim where our bags had been removed from the belts and deposited anywhere there was room. Then we were greeted with huge queues at the car rental desks. It may sound sensationalist, but it has honestly put me off travelling to Orlando again. The way out wasn't much better. An hour and a half to get through security on the way out. Staff looked like they didn't care and were rude and arrogant. I'm not sure I understand the idea of all the best shops and restaurants being before the security checks either. You can't spend any time browsing as you don't know how long it's going to take to get through. Once you get through security your choice is severely limited. Can I make one suggestion?

Our latest experience with the North terminal almost makes me swear off flying forever. We are forced by the airlines and the airport to arrive three hours before a flight, which usually means trying to find a place to sit and maybe have a meal of some kind. The restaurant has about 1 seat available for every 3 patrons. Trying to squeeze through the masses and find somewhere to sit is something I expect at a German beer hall, but not at a major airport. There is only one lift available to the public to get to the mezzanine/restaurant level, and when we were last there it was out of order, meaning we had to schlep our luggage up the stairs. Every restaurant is cramped with seating that is too close to accommodate the throngs of people and baggage. The noise is deafening.

They could be used for a child perhaps age 3 or older  i.e. the kinds who can walk and dont need the pram! Ironally the prams have a flag on them that says Family Friendly Gatwick. Traveling by myself, I had to carry the checked in baggage and my baby for a long walk to Customs, wait in a horrendous lineup through Customs, and then wait in the luggage area before finally retrieving our stroller, which was had bits loose that had separated and were scattered around different parts of the baggage area (literally, at different carousels). Before Customs, we went into the baby change room only to find a filthy toilet and sink  and no baby change table. It appeared to have been removed from the wall.

Would not extend my booking at all but insisted on a new reservation at 6 times the original rate! Now for leaving! Ride the Conga Line through the expensive and hot duty free. What a joke. Then find a seat and try and read the departures board. Who invented those things? I had just passed my First Class pilot medical yet had trouble reading them.

However, when I noted to the staff at immigration that I had submitted mine through Mobile Passport, she rudely said that they ""weren't doing that"". Thankfully the line for US citizens was short and I was out of there in 15 minutes. I followed the signs for connecting flights and had to go through security to get to the main gates, which didnt take long. Unfortunately, when I got the gates and I checked to screens to confirm my gate number, I noticed that my flight was not posted. I asked a friendly staff in the information kiosk and he informed me that I must be at the wrong terminal and I had to take a shuttle to the correct terminal and get out of the airport and go through TSA again. I panicked since it was 6:15pm and my flight was supposed to start boarding at 6:20pm. I arrived at the correct terminal and spoke with a staff member at the exit and she advised that indeed I would have to go through TSA again. When I told her that my flight had started boarding she said Yeah, youre definitely going to miss your flight. Once I arrived at security check I looked for the TSA pre-check line (which I have) but didnt see it, so asked the person directing everyone in line and I also mentioned that my flight had already started boarding and he said Youre probably going to miss your flight but just enter here and ask the staff at the front if you can go in the priority line. When I arrived at the front of the line before the boarding pass check, I asked the staff member if I could go in the priority line since my flight had started boarding and she said no, sorry!. I started panicking, so I asked if the fact that I have TSA Pre-Check made a difference and she said uhm, TSA pre-check is on the other side and pointed me to it. I rushed over to the TSA pre-check area and was able to complete the security check in 15 minutes, which compared to everything else in this airport, it was a breeze. Finally, the inefficiency of this airport worked to my advantage and although I arrived 5 minutes after my flight was supposed to take off, there were people still boarding the plane. Moral of the story, I just came believe I had so many staff member telling me that I was going to miss my flight, but none tried to do anything about it. I also dont understand why the TSA pre-check line is so hidden that not even the staff members know where it is. You can do better Orlando."

Why everyone flying feels like the only reason they are there is because their private jet is being worked on is beyond me. Travelers, just smile, relax ask the TSA agent how his day has been going and you will get through security quickly and stress free.

The security queues on outbound flights were about 30 mins long but staff were on hand to make the various lines as quick as possible. Of course we didn't have to suffer the immigration queues and that is their problem. There appear to be new self service immigration consoles in place but weren't in use at that time.

On the morning of departure, security was a shambles. The staff were all talking over each other, countermaning instructions to passengers and generally causing a state of anxiety. Please remember that although staff are there everyday and know what the process is, its unlikely that passengers are so familiar. Im all in favour if enhanced security, but the area delegated is too small for the number of staff and passengers and this leads to passengers being parted from bags and separation of grey boxes so it becomes harder to keep up with whats happening which adds to the distress. A grown up at the airport would benefit from standing and watching the process to see what is actually happening as opposed to what they think is happening. After security the black sparkly path leads through the duty free, all quite unpleasant, loud and garish and so immediately after the security stress cannot be good for sales. Food outlets in the north terminal are over crowded and shabby. Oh dear what message are we giving overseas visitors.

I asked a member of staff as to why there are no staff on to deal with the amount of people in the queue I got a shrug of the shoulders and told to move, they were not interested in the fact we were going to miss our connection because of this and we were not the only ones this happened to. Once through, which had taken well over an hour to get through, we had missed our connection. Went to the American Airlines desk as we had missed our connection to be told there are no more flights tonight and would have to fly at 07.04am the next day, I told the lady that we would require a hotel for the night for the 6 of us, was told as we flew in on a BA flight we would have to see them in regards to that. I kindly told the lady that American Airlines is part of the same alliance as British Airways and would she call them to do so, eventually we were given a hotel and were told to go upstairs to the BA desk where they were waiting for us.

The woman who weighed and took my luggage was an absolute joke. I asked her multiple times what I had to do first, since it's been a while, to make both her and my job easier but she insisted on giving me a hard time and actually asked me why I didn't know what to do? Maybe because she couldn't do the only job she had and tell me. It would have taken 2 seconds to understand and get that process over with but she obviously had some personal issues or horrible customer service skills. There is no comparison with this airport and the airports in Florida where I traveled to.

Worst part is once we somehow managed to move our carts outside the immigration and baggage pick up we been told that we have to drop our bags at another belt and take the train which will take us to main arrival halls where we had to pick up our luggage again.

On top of that you are not allowed to use your mobile in Immigration Hall. Can anyone explain why or is that just some stupid rule from the dark ages.

Quite a unique feature, ensuring that one cannot check ones flight and its status till one is trapped in the departures area! On my return on Sunday, 26 November, on flight EZY8088 from Athens, the staff member meeting the flight, standing at the bottom of the plane steps pointed to a green painted path on the tarmac and told us to follow this to the arrivals hall: this is the only airport these days, in my experience, where passengers have to walk on the tarmac in all weathers to access the arrivals hall, everywhere else there are at least buses to take them there. On arrival to the gate, we had to negotiate a number of flights of stairs unaided. This was very difficult for some rather frail passengers with luggage. There was, of course, no staff around to offer assistance or even ask for anything. When we got to the landing, we found the swing doors there (Gate 49) locked! This resulted in a crush and panic, as more and more passengers were entering this confined space with no exit. A fellow passenger used the emergency phone located there to ask for help. He was told to stay there (!) and that someone would be on their way to unlock the gates. No one arrived and, about 10 minutes later, passengers smashed the emergency release button and eventually unlocked the gates. A shameful shambles at a supposedly major international airport!"

This wouldn't have been a problem had I not been behind four other people, one of which had about one hundred bite size snickers in her bag. They checked each stupid snicker four times. This took forever. I asked if I could just leave my food behind so they didn't have to check it, and I would just bring my keys, wallet, and cellphone. They wouldn't budge at all.

I have lived in Charlotte all my life and I am very familiar with the airport, but with all the construction going on at CLT there have been more issues I have encountered, mostly associated with parking, but this was probably was the worst out of all of them. I was flying American Airlines from Charlotte to Pittsburgh to see friends and normally I use Park N' Go but this time I decided I'd park in the Daily Decks since it was closer to the terminal I was only going for 3 days, I always avoid the Long Term lots since those lots are a zoo and they have been that way forever. When I parked the first shuttle was full so I waited almost 20 minutes for another one to come and when it came the driver offered no help to anyone with large suitcases. In the airport the line at check in was ridiculous, the agents were taking their sweet time checking people in, American app was not working so I couldn't check in with it. Check-in took about 25 minutes, security lines were insanely long and I finally ended up going to the E checkpoint even though my flight was at Concourse C since it was the least of all of evils but even then TSA still took almost an hour. TSA Staff were all very rude and were barking orders at people military style, I put my laptop in the plastic bin with my wallet, phone, and shoes like I have countless times before without a problem and the TSA agent barked at me claiming I wasn't following directions and that my laptop had to go in it's own container, I looked on TSA.gov and nowhere does it say that's required, all it says is you have to remove the laptop from your carry on, which I did. Of course since I knew they were just doing their job I didn't argue. I go through the scanner and wait for my bags and I couldn't find my backpack, I ask one of the agents and she flat out ignored me and said I was asking the wrong person. I finally saw them staring at my bag on the screen and I stood there until finally after 15 minutes an agent asked ""is this your bag"" and I said yes. As it turned out a set of souvenir coins that had formed a clump in my backpack apparently looked weird but when I asked if I could just take it out and show them what it was they yelled at me saying I wasn't allowed to touch the bag and I'd be denied boarding if I did. Nobody was willing to help, they were treating all the passengers like dogs, even children and the elderly, it was just appalling. There's a large amount of restaurants and retail outlets at CLT but once you're at the gate the seating areas are cramped and there is very limited seating. The concourses have hardly changed at all since the late 90s. Some of the gates in Concourse E still use ancient dot matrix printers. After the TSA incident I just barely made my flight by 15 minutes even though I arrived at the airport almost 2 hours prior, gate agent was the only nice person I encountered at the airport, she probably heard of the all the TSA problems from other passengers because when she scanned my ticket she said ""don't worry I wouldn't have closed the door on you"" she said there were 12 people on the flight still stuck in the TSA lines. Given this is my home airport it is embarrassing to see that they treat customers like this."

The only flights that were boarding in this area of the departures was the 2 Air Canada flights to Australia that night. There were no restaurants or bars nearby and the only shop that was open was a newsagent that also had a small 9 table area where a lady was serving either 'Red or White'. I did go for a glass of the red, as that was the only thing that was around. However, we did take a quick walk towards the main part of the international terminal once we got through security, which looked like there were a few more options that were still open at that time of night. It was about a 10 minute walk back to our gate so we didn't want to go too far. The terminal did have lots of seating and nice washroom facilities. I just wish we had a better gate number that was more central in the international terminal.

2017-12-08,2017-12-08,7.0,"""Overall, it's a decent airport""","  |    SFO is my home airport. I've flown domestically a couple of times out of it, but with the lack of service on domestic airlines, I really don't like flying on US carriers. Thus, my review is a compilation of experiences on both departures and arrivals at SFO over the last six years. My wife and I travel two to three times a year, mostly to Asia to visit her relatives. Most of the TPAC flights we've taken out of SFO have been late night and the security line experience has been quite quick. SFO doesn't use TSA agents. They were allowed to hire contract employees instead and the difference shows, at least in the international security lines. I believe the longest I've taken in a security line is about 15 minutes, and that was for a rare day flight. So departures are typically pretty good. Arrivals have been a different story. We got into the Global Entry system pretty early in the game, back before credit card offers to reimburse the $100 fee were common. We did it after one particularly heinous arrival in which two 380's and a couple of 777's all landed within minutes of each other, coupled with a computer glitch, caused the lines to simply be ridiculous. If you're familiar with the arrivals layout, you know there's a gate way the heck down at the far end of the arrivals hall. That's where the back of the line was. I believe it was 2.5 hours to get through immigration after all was said and done. But even before that, lines were typically about an hour long, even when fewer than the maximum number of flights land simultaneously. Global Entry changed that for us. The last flight we took arrived back in SFO on December 5th at 6.16pm, according to FlightAware. We were in my brother-in-law's car at 6.45 with our baggage. Lounges at SFO are pretty spartan. We have the Priority Pass, and the only lounge that's available in the entire airport, domestic or international, is on the OneWorld (AA) side of international departures. None are in domestic departures. And the international departure area is separated to such an extent that if you go to the OneWorld side and your flight is departing on the Star Alliance side, you have to back out from the secure area and then pass security on the other side. Not a well thought out design. We've also used the United Lounge, and those are pretty universally grim. Signage is good. The food and beverage on the airside, while a little steep (what airport isn't), was pretty decent. While it's possible to get to and from the airport on public transit, I wouldn't recommend it. BART is a pretty poorly run system and security is not exactly their forte, so I would imagine someone with suitcases would be seen as easy pickings. My one experience with the super shuttle was a Zero Dark Thirty ride one morning from our house about 10 miles away. For my wife and I, it was about $20. Overall, it's a decent airport. It won't compare with the Changi's, Incheon's or even Bangkok airports of the world, but it's serviceable and, sadly, it represents one of the better airports in the country."

Immigration/Customs clearance with the new computer terminals, where they scan your passport then you need to line your face in a narrow scan on the screen but the camera is up higher than where you are looking, so fail! After that you spend at least 1 to 2 hrs snaking back and forth to see an agent, whoever looks after this process needs to visit Australia.

","  |  Unpleasant security line experience. We were taking a 6am flight on Sunday and found ourselves in front of a huge line of travelers one hour ahead of the departure time. While it was our problem to not arrive earlier, I approached a mid-aged male staff guiding the traffic, asking if there is an express line for people with less than 30 minutes to departure, so that we can be prepared if we couldn't make it in time. First, upon seeing me approaching, the male staff just turned his back towards me, and I had to address him in the front for him to speak with me, and then instead of pointing me to a panel with waiting time (it was above the security check), he replied ""No, you have to wait in line."" I then asked: ""Do you think I can make it"", he says with such plain tones: ""I don't know, you need to arrive early"". And then he turned his back to me again! It wasn't like there were other people around waiting for his help. Thank goodness that the lady at the entrance (who was super busy) was kind enough to tell us that we can make it and we actually made it. I just think that if you'd like to have tourists coming back, at least be somewhat friendly and stop turning your back!"

I connect semi-regularly through DFW - makes sense, as it's American's headquarters and largest hub. I'll say right here that I love connecting through DFW. It is one of the easiest airports for connections that I've ever experienced. The concourses are wide and open, seldom choked by clusters of boarding passengers. The physical layout of the concourses minimizes the need for airplanes to wait on the tarmac ""for traffic to clear the alley,"" as happens at other airports like O'Hare. Best of all, the SkyTrain at DFW absolutely flies, and can connect you from one corner of the airport to the farthest other corner in about 9 minutes. I'll accept a tighter connect at DFW than I will almost anywhere else, because of that SkyTrain. Dining at DFW is varied and generally good. B Terminal is a little skimpy, but otherwise I have no complaints. Restrooms are generally large enough for the number of travelers, and generally clean. I've had loo-oong layovers, and have walked the entirety of all terminals at DFW...and can report that they are basically all consistently good and competent. The biggest detractor I can find is that there's no airport WiFi. At least, I haven't ever found one to sign into. I agree with a previous reviewer that a lot of the hateful reviews must come from passengers who are generally unaware of the requirements of modern air travel (which is okay; not everyone flies weekly like I do) but don't want to admit when they've made a mistake.

In the past year, I have had a higher percentage of my flights into and out of SFO delayed than at any other airport. When I check FlightAware, in general the other two Bay Area airports will be on-time, while SFO will be delayed. I have been delayed due to fog, winds, air traffic, runway construction and smoke. The most heinous delay was when airport operations decided to ""flip the airport"" - switch which direction traffic would land and take off - which made every airplane on the ground, even ones lined up to take off, have to then taxi around to a different runway. This happened after they closed the boarding door on my flight and put us twenty-sixth in line for take-off and delayed us for over an hour. This was one of the only two times I've ever actually missed a connecting flight. Other than SFO's near-incompetence with their core function, the airport is largely okay. I fly American from Terminal 2, but I go through security at the Delta terminal, Terminal 1, because there are currently only 8 gates in operation there, and I can go through PreCheck in less than 5 minutes, then walk over to T2 inside security. The tram that runs to the rental car facility is rather slow, but does the job fairly stress-free. And, it's fun to look at the jumbo and super-jumbo jets (Airbus 380, that is) that fly internationally. But in general, I try to avoid SFO, especially for departures if I have to make a connection."

The checking in and screening process are better than at most airports I know. One of the features of the airport I always enjoyed, was the availability of good restaurants, both in the terminal, before screening, and at the gate area. Last year the airport started to ""remodel"" the terminal and all of these nice restaurants were gone. I figured they would be back after the construction was over, but not only are they still doing construction a year later, the nice restaurants are gone, even in the gate area, and all they now offer is Chinese and fast food. They destroyed the whole pre-boarding experience, especially since you have to come to the airport early for your flight. The only place you can get a decent meal now, is in the airport hotel Marriott restaurant."

The special assistance service is excellent and I can recommend it to anybody who has mobility or other problems when travelling. The man who drove the buggy to the plane was very friendly and happy and went the extra mile for myself and two other people using the service.

","  | This by far the worst airport experience I have had in a long time. The staff were doing busy-work but the administration is very poorly organized. Our Southwest flight (outbound in 40 minutes) did not show up on the departure screens and the information booth said they were not aware of any outbound flights to that destination around the given time. Unlike most airports, different gate groupings are not connected to each other, which is fine, but it doesnt say that explicitly at the security check point. A confusing sign at one of the gates made it seem like it would be OK to go through any checkpoint. Fortunately our e-boarding pass finally updated with the gate number but we were on the wrong side of gate groupings. We had to double back out and make it through the other side. God bless you if you have to fly out of this airport."

I can't say Philadelphia airport is the worst airport I've ever been to as it's clean, has a lot of places to get food and shop, there are a few places to charge your phone, and most of the staff I have encountered are friendly. My only problems with this airport are that flights never depart on time because boarding almost always starts when the flight was supposed to originally take off, it's impossible to get a wifi connection and some of the staff can be quite careless. I was recently in a position where I had a connecting flight and was put on standby and left to sit around the gate even after the plane had taken off just to be informed I would not be put on the flight, and if I managed to get on the next one I would be stranded in Arizona overnight for possibly 3 whole days. I had only ever agreed to originally being on standby as the person who booked my ticket had assured me I'd be on the plane, so I can understand what the other reviewers are talking about when they comment on confusion among staff. I had to talk to 3 people before having to cancel my flight and pay for a new ticket, but the situation left me stuck in Philadelphia, as I had come from New Jersey. I wish Philadelphia airport had more options when it comes to getting from there to Jersey and vice versa as Philadelphia airport is the only airport near Jersey besides New York (Atlantic City doesn't count). Other than those flaws it is an airport and it does get the job done - maybe not in the best way possible, but good enough to still go to."

We had plenty of food choices (though a few less fast food and more healthy options would be great) and well organized lounges. But the shining crown was the response of lost and found, after my son left his Nintendo in the waiting lounge. We filled out the online form and within 2 hours had a response that the item was found. They organized having it sent to us (we pay postage, of course), and a ""disaster"" was averted seamlessly.

I asked if I could just pay cash and was denied. I think MSP needs to be careful not to get so technologically full of themselves as to restrict business.

I know this isn't in Orlando, but some might be lured by the lower prices to use this airport instead of flying direct to Orlando. We have just used it, and saved 1600 for a party of six, including two children, into the bargain. But was it worth it? Well yes, I suppose it was, but the transfers within the airport itself is pretty dire. There are four terminals, BA arrive in Terminal 4, the hire cars are in Terminal 1, which involves a bus ride and no means of transferring luggage other than to carry it. Luckily we were only doing it one way, on the way back, as our BA flight to FLL was cancelled and we flew direct to Orlando on the 4th February instead of the 3rd to FLL. Bear in mind we are four adults, two children aged 5 and 2, five cases, sundry handbaggage and two car seats and you can see the problem. Ten dollars for two trolleys from the car hire drop-off, up one floor, and outside to the bus. A bit of a scrum, everybody is carrying large amounts of luggage trying to get on. The bus driver did his best, no doubt illegal with the amount of cases stacked on the floors because the racks were full. So round to terminal 4, another ten dollars to get two trollies to wheel into the dparture area, a total of about one hundred yards. You can walk it apparently, but it would take about twenty minutes. Hot, dirty, tired, andand extremely annoyed, the name neither has the glitz of Hollywood and certainly none of the slickness of an International Airport. Once inside things improve a bit. Didn't use the catering so can't comment. Seemed to be staffed by agency staff who's command of English was pretty low in some cases, and the use of some screeching announcer who not only talked too fast but the pitch of her voice made her unintelligible."

To start with, the entire process of going through TSA security took 35 minutes. Despite people queuing up all the way into the atrium of the airport, TSA only had a few lines open. One of them was fully staffed but TSA officers were just standing around, laughing and high-fiving each other for several minutes. Then, they allowed a number of people who had only just entered, to proceed to this newly opened line, when everyone else who had been waiting for 15+ minutes were kept waiting. One particular demeaning and nasty TSA individual on a power trip was working the line I went through. As usual, there were no bins to put items in so I waited next to the belt. I was then yelled at ""Why are you standing around, you're holding up the line"". I politely explained that I was waiting for them to restock the bins to which he responded by yelling at me, ""Nobody told you to do that, keep moving. You're holding up the line"". I turned to the passengers behind me, and they looked as apologetic as I did. Another TSA worker then quickly restocked the bins, but the hostility and rudeness of the TSA staff really shocked me. I don't think I will be traveling through this airport again if I can avoid it, and rather attend my meeting as a phone call, or worst case, drive.

My pregnant wife was berated by a sassy airport employee during her pat-down, and was denigrated for bringing food for the flight. People selected for additional screening were waiting an average of 20 minutes after passing through security just to have someone pawing through their personal effects aimlessly. There was no privacy for the pat-down, which they required for us to bring our baby's food through security. Every time I route through LAX I spend at least 20 extra minutes on the tarmac, and every time I think the same thing: this is the worst airport I have ever flown through. Also, there is no skytrain between terminals, so if you need to transfer between terminals, you also have to pass through security again! Incredibly inefficient-like most of California."

2018-04-04,2018-04-04,1.0,"""a total disaster in terms of customer service""","  | I have been traveling through this airport since the early 1980's. The airport was clearly well designed from the start with a central hub supporting multiple airsides via automated trams. The system worked and worked well for many years. After 911, the main long term parking terminal was closed and a remote long term parking garage was built away from the main terminal. It wasn't a great solution, but the shuttle buses ran quickly and delivered you right to the correct airside. Later, the original long term parking area was reopened with increased pricing. The new remote site was renamed ""economy parking"", though at $10 per day it was hardly economy. But that price was better than the $18 per day of the reopened long term garage. So, for many years I would park in the economy garage then ride the shuttle to the main terminal. From there I would check-in at curbside and take the tram over to my airside. Recently the airport has undergone major revisions which include a monorail system that joins the economy garage to the main terminal. Also, a new centralized car rental facility has been built which is next to the economy garage and also served by the monorail. The result is a total disaster in terms of customer service. I don't know who designed this mess, but I can tell they have no idea how to move people through an airport facility. First you must find parking in the economy garage, which isn't easy because the space inventory system is now broken. There used to be signs that would tell you how many spaces were on each floor. Apparently the new construction broke that system, so good luck finding a space. Next you have to take the elevator down to the first floor, even though the monorail is located on the 4th floor. Then, you drag your luggage to the middle of the garage road and jump on the moving floor system. Yes, they mounted the moving floor in the middle of the garage's shuttle roadway. Not on the sidewalk (where they have plenty of room), but right in the lowest part of the garage where surely the Florida rains will short circuit the machinery. The moving floor thing will slowly take you to the opposite side of the garage where a new elevator systems has been installed. Where next? No problem in deciding, there are only 2 floors to select. So now you go back up to the 4th floor to wait for the monorail. And wait, and wait. There appear to be only two trains and one was broken. Once on the train, prepare for a wild ride. First the train drops 4 floors and accelerates as it follows the access road to the main terminal. People and luggage fly about as the train dips and weaves at high speed. I'm sure injuries have already occurred due to this new system. As it approaches the main terminal, the train climbs quickly and stops abruptly at the station. If you've survived this far, you must now drag your luggage to the escalator for a trip down 3 floors. Now good luck finding your airline counter. If you're flying Southwest then you're in luck, it's the first one you find. Other airlines are scattered around and the signage isn't so good. Prepare for a lot of wandering around. Once you check-in, you now ride another escalator up and find that you are nowhere near your airside tram station. So, more walking to find the correct station and ride the tram over to your airside. In my case, the airside has been redesigned (which means less space and more expensive restaurants)."
2018-04-05,2018-04-05,3.0,"""Absolute chaos""","  | Using Domestic Terminal to fly to New York from Oahu. Absolute chaos. The queues make no sense and merge into each other for boarding passes and bag drop off. There is a system and it could work well if there were instructions anywhere. You first need to weigh your check in bags and the screens are really self explanatory. You have good choices to use eticket scan, input flight confirmation no. Scan passport etc. The machine then walks you through weighing bags etc before printing off your boarding passes, bag tags and receipt for any costs. You then need to join the bag drop off queue once you work out where it ends as the queues for the bag weigh machines stem out around circular hubs and invariably merge with the single bag drop queue. Once youve dropped off your bag, you need to work out which security queue you need to be in. Security B is TSA and the others A, C and D are for all others. We were in C despite this being clearly labelled international when we were going to Mainland US. Once you get through security, options for food etc are ok. Toilets were dated but clean. There is free WiFi and sockets to charge phones etc free. Travel to the gates is far easier by foot than the further confusion of the wiki wiki bus. The airport is small enough to get to any of the gates within 10 mins Walking and theyre well signposted (although your bags are scanned again as you technically go outside albeit undercover). In summary, once you get through security its ok inside. Just try and do as much yourself as if you need to rely on staff, youll struggle."
2018-04-05,2018-04-05,6.0,"""better than led to believe""","  | Reviews of Fort Lauderdale Airport have been none too complementary, particularly in relation to getting between terminals and the arrival experience. The airport is undergoing extensive refurbishment to bring it into the 21st century and more humanely manage the 32 million passengers that passed through its gates in 2017. As of March 2018, there's still some way to go. Arrival from LGW on a BA flight started off badly as we were kept waiting 30 minutes until we could disembark. This is commonplace, apparently. A touch of amusement was added to the frustration when some new glass doors just inside the terminal refused to accept a key code. Eventually, they did open and one had a chance to see what the new airport is going to look light: light and spacious, but with the usual long walkways to get to customs and baggage collection. Like other US airports, FLL has Automated Passport Control (APC) which gives passengers the good feeling that getting through customs will be much quicker, but which turns out to be just another level of bureacracy and adding yet more mug shots and fingerprints to the database that the US must have on every entrant. The overall process of getting through customs and baggage collection, plus someone to check that the APC had a stamp on it and another to relieve each passenger, added up to just over an hour. That's not that bad, as many reviews report waits of several hours. Once out of terminal 4, it's then a matter of waiting for the complementary shuttle to take one to terminal one where the car rental is also based. In the end, we gave up with the wait and paid $20 each to a man with a minibus who took us there a lot quicker. For the return trip, we used the complementary shuttle and were impressed by the helpfulness of the driver, who actually got out of his seat to help people on and off with their luggage. Check-in for BA Club World was absolutely fine, but the security check process was made over-complicated by staff putting everyone through the 3D body scanner and insisting that everything (tissues and gum included) were removed from pockets - and giving passengers plenty of attitude if those requirements weren't adhered to. Surprisingly, there's no business class lounge in the international terminal, which seems a huge oversight if FLL wishes to attract premium customers. That said, there was a spacious area prior to the gates with plenty of seats (including rocking chairs) overlooking the runway and a number of food and drink concessions. And there was free WiFi. Unfortunately, some of the staff possessed the same attitudinal problem as that encountered going through security. Overall, FLL was better than we'd been led to believe and we'd use it again in preference to Miami."

I figured it being spring break would add to congestion but when other passengers are panicked about missing flights because lines arent moving then it is truly Houston we have a problem. My sister traveled on a different fight and missed her connection due to the hold up. Agents were predictably rude, unhelpful, and uncommunicative. I actually had an agent push her finger into my stomach and asked why I still had a belt on and told me to lift my shirt up high. Guess what, no belt, just a muffin top.

The two women trying to organize the line did it by yelling and talking in bossy, annoyed tones to the hundreds of innocent people who were all just trying to do what they said. When someone made a mistake, heaven forbid if you didnt exactly understand what go to the end means when the room is the size of a football field, then that poor person was berated by the employee who then walked away shaking her head as if every human was an idiot. After our first two negative interactions I started talking to my kids about how we should treat people. They could see how the employees we treating everyone and they could tell that we were just trying to obey whatever rules were in place to avoid being singled out. Unfortunately we saw employees act like school yard bullies well over a dozen times and didnt see one kind exchange in the entire 2 hours that we spent in the Miami airport. Chaotic and horrible."

In that area, 2 people worked running the checks, one person sat on the front desk taking passports and handing them on, another supervisor sat and watched the TV and two more (maybe security) wandered around the waiting room occasionally in between sitting down watching TV and napping. One man was told by the lady at the desk to stand by the vending machine, a while later he was shouted at by another staff member for standing there and told to stand in the other corner. He said thats where he was told to stand so she shouted well now Im telling you to stand over there ao you go stand over there Even if its a connecting flight, LAX require all luggage to be picked up and then taken to another area for it to be checked in to the final destination. This makes LAX a poor choice for connecting flights. Toilets very dirty landside but better airside. The security screening is moderately rapid but there are no signs up to explain what should be done (shoes off, liquids in a bag etc) which means its mainly managed by staff yelling at the guests - usually with conflicting instructions.

On the plus side, the immigration and customs guys were great and professional though the lines were long as they had only three counters open to cope with many passengers who were arriving through several flights.

Coming back from Mexico, all of us missed the connecting flight to Doha as the lines were even longer, thanks to the American Airlines officer at the airlines desk counter, she managed to get us on the next day direct flight to Doha. My question is as to why transit passengers who do not wish to enter the US are not processed quicker and without needing to go out of the airport, like in most other international airports?

No. That only took 30 minutes. No big whoop. Next: customs and another huge line. Only 2 counters were open!

TSA can have a reputation, but the staff of LAS go far above and beyond to berate and belittle travelers, I was astounded by their treatment of a woman in a wheelchair and a man whos luggage and person was being inspected. I'm embarrassed that these employees get their kicks out of feeling more powerful than airport patrons by being bullies. The airport is dirty and reeks of cigarettes and the design is unfortunate (the closest bathroom to my gate was a good 10 minute walk, only to find out it was closed for cleaning and I had to wander another long hall in the wrong direction while my flight was boarding). I know this is a bit scathing, I had a great time on my trip, but left with a terrible taste in my mouth."

Only 5 officers for Canadian residents with 100's of people in the queue. 1hr+ then get out and wait for baggage for another hour. Carousel keeps stopping because it's full because everyone is delayed in customs! Air Canada baggage guy was not helpful. They need to have people removing bags so it will keep running. I have been to much larger airports (ie: Shanghai) who handle much more volume but are way faster thru customs/baggage. Get it together YVR and Air Canada - terrible service.

Took nearly 2 hours to get through immigration and then we had to run through airport and push to the front of security in order to make our connecting flight (which we had already allowed a 2 hours layover for!). The staff couldn't understand what they were doing, we were queuing into an area where we had to get ESTA receipts and then 45 mins later another load of planes arrive and get guided into a similar area which is inexplicably not being used, with the result that people who had arrived 45 mins after us got through immigration quicker due to poor poor queue management. Cannot understand why those on connecting flights need to do the immigration process, transferring in the UK doesn't require this and it seems really unnecessary when you aren't even leaving the airport."

The whole airport is terrible and a trip hazard as ita going under works or its falling apart. The signage is poor and you have no idea where you're going especially for car rental. The tram from the terminal to the main terminal was unsafe, such a small waiting area which filled quickly then more people kept coming up the escalator not knowing how full it was had no where to go, it was chaos. It took us over 2 and a half hours to get out of the airport. On departure finding the check in desks was actually fine but more chaos from there. We arrived the 2 hours before checked in straight away then was met by 45 minute wait to get through security, there was no movement at all in any of the queues. It got to the point where I had to go and tell our airline we weren't going to make the flight to which they escorted us through. But even with an escort it was slow. Departure lounge and seating was poor, then the airport had delays so the plane was delayed landing. Thing we will be trying the other airport at Orlando"

Its as if they have mud in their shoes and are under the influence of something other than compassion and customer service. Nothing will come of this review, I just suggest trying any possible way to not go to the Denver airport aka DIA. I personally will pay double for any ticket to fly non stop from my hometown.

It took 3 hours to get through arrivals, the staff were pretty unfriendly and they stressed a lot of people out, especially people that had transits. If you have any other option I would arrive at a different airport. Departure was fine but lack of food after 9.00pm is pretty unusual for an airport in a developed country.

Even if we consider a minimum 150 passengers from non us citizen and stand in queue, total people standing will be 1200. If one person spending roughly 5 minutes it's not rocket science to deploy the required capacity to clear queues. I spent 1 hour 30 minutes both times in these queues. Another chaos at the luggage belt, no discipline at all. I don't know the role played by airport staff to streamline these processes and traffic load management. Same thing happens at the boarding train point, total chaos. It's a small conveyor belt and everyone jumps on. It's like you are going to ride last scheduled train which takes you to exit doors. Overall, I will suggest to use other airports as entry points in US and travel domestic routes. At least you will save lot of time coming out of airport."

I must sadly say that arriving into Denver international airport on international flights is always very painful, literally a 3rd world experience. Coming off the plane, passengers are herded into narrow hallways and escalators. The first waiting line for the automated immigration desks often takes 30 to 40 minutes. Then, to everyones surprise there is a second, long queue downstairs, that also often take 20 to 30 minutes. Luggage takes forever to reach the carousels. I would suggest that the management of the DIA airport travels to Singapore or Doha, Dubai or Bangkok to see how it is done. Colorado deserves better at its first International Gateway."

One place to eat with no seating and less than 10 items on the menu. No place to sit at the gate. They ask you arrive over 2 hours early for your flight and then offer you no where to sit. I have been to over a dozen different airports and this is by far the worse I have ever been to. The only saving grace is the workers are nice, but when you have no where to sit and can barely move through the terminal, this hardly matters."

The nightmare started after I entered the LAX international terminal, The first bad experience was the baggage carousel, which was going to handle my flights luggage, broke down. They waited for 30 minutes before deciding to bring my flights luggage through another carousel. This was putting catching my new connecting flight at risk. I finally got my checked luggage, cleared customs and was directed to the connecting flights area. After another 30 minute wait, my luggage was checked in on a Delta Airlines flight and instead of a boarding pass, given an A4 piece of paper and told curtly to go to terminal 2. At the crowded terminal 2 I was curtly told by terminal 2 staff to use one of the check in kiosks. The kiosk would not accept the information on the sheet of paper. Luckily some Qantas passengers, who were in the same predicament as me found someone who finally gave me my boarding pass. I finally got to the boarding gate with 10 minutes to spare. To sum it up, my main criticism is the baggage carousel breakdown and their refusal to bring our flights luggage through a different one and the unpleasant and impersonal airline staff who treat anybody who is unfamiliar with the terminal like a sheep."

They need more training and made me miss my international flight after my bag was re-scanned 3 times because the bin was dysfunctioning and the scanner did not take a picture. That occurred multiple times before changing the bin. Then my partner was calling to relay information to the gate, but they would not allow me to even answer my phone which was ringing right in front of me, they treated me like a criminal for wanting to answer my phone. So I missed my international flight. I wanted to make sure this did not happen to others so I submitted a claim/complaint but nothing happened and no one did anything, we didnt even get an apology let alone reimbursement or an assurance that they will improve and not let this happen again."

We could not find any comfy chairs. Those AP chairs are so uncomfortable and armless, good luck in terminal A. Admirals Club only open during the day and not at night, food court left a lot to be desired at Terminal A. They should update the seating and put rockers in like Charlotte. Even places to sleep overnight with sofas and TVs. Very large lot of walking from Main Building to flight Terminals. I felt like John McClain running down the walking sidewalks. Not laid out well and nowhere quiet to sleep. Could not wait to get out of Denver. Only 2 TSA entrances so come early, very crowded. Restrooms were nasty and unclean. Saw no one in cleaning them."

Rental car return area is a 2-3 mile bus ride, understaffed, and again, extremely rude. People driving the busses both to and from the terminals didn't speak very good English, and though I tried to explain that I was leaving out of terminal B, was assured that the terminal E bus would get me there as he took my bag and loaded it - it didn't go to B. No one at terminals to help. Ended up paying a shuttle driver $40 to take me to B. One TSA check point for 30 or 40 gates, combined with bad information, almost caused me to miss my flight even though I pulled in to car return 2 hours before my flight was scheduled. The sign that led to nowhere led me to a door that said ""no re-entry"" once you pass through. I opened the door and stuck my head out to see where I was only to yelled at by a security lady. She threatened me stating I had to come on out even though my entire body (minus my head) was still inside the door. When I tried to ask where I needed to be the yelling got worse. To the point she threatened to have me arrested if I didn't come on through. I've never been treated as rudely at an airport as I was at this one. Never again will I use this airport."

The disaster started with a 40 minute wait for my arriving plane to get a gate for us to debark. In 60 years of flying, in airports all over the country, I've never had to wait more than 10 minutes for my plane to get a gate. Then finding that my connecting flight was in another building and I would ""just have to go downstairs, through the tunnel and upstairs to the other gates,"" the gate clerk scoffed at me when I said that would take 40 minutes with my arthritic knees. He didn't offer transportation, I had to ask for it. Apparently there are no golf carts or trolleys for the mobility disabled at the airport, as there are in every other airport I've visited. He ordered a wheelchair, which took 20 minutes to arrive. In spite of everyone's assurances that I would make it, the plane left without me when I was only a gate and a half away. No one ever attempted to contact the departing gate to let them know that a crippled passenger was trying desperately to get there on time. Other than the wheelchairs, which are slow and take an inexcusable amount of time to arrive, this airport makes no attempt to accommodate mobility handicapped persons. There were no electric carts traveling the length of the interminably long tunnel between C and A terminals, and none that I could see at gate level either. Again, something I've seen in all but the smallest airports. This is not a place a mobility disabled person would want to travel through."

Arrived on A380 flight from London at the same time as an Air France flight. 10 minute walk to passport check not too bad but that is as good as it got! Met by a very rude SFO staff member whom herded us like cattle into the international queue. It was at this point that it dawned on me I was going to be there a while ... a very long while to be precise. 10+ CBP desks all unmanned except ,yep you guessed, 1 CBP to check what I estimated to be at least 400 people in the queue. I counted probably 100 in front of me so unless they were to put more staff on (I counted at least 3 walking around chatting but not on desks) average 2-3 mins per person, I was in the queue for the long haul (pun intended!) There were families with small children in the queue some as young as 2 whose parents seemed to be at their wits end trying to keep them within the confines of the queuing system ......come on SFO airport sort it out so those with very small children and the elderly be given priority it is not on! Anyway after 2 hours in the queue and approx 40 people in front of me somebody took the initiative to open up a few more desks and some 30 mins later I received my stamp and was in the baggage hall. At least I wont have to wait for my bag to arrive I thought - wrong it had arrived but then they had put the Air France flight on the same carousel mixing everybodys bags up. As we had all been in immigration so long the bags had been removed from the belts and dotted around the baggage hall. Top tip if you cant find your suitcase and are told that it has arrived ask to see if any bags had been taken downstairs to make space! As after about 50 minutes that was where I had to gamble on going (have to clear customs to go downstairs with no way back if it is not there) to visually identify it - to summarise disembark the airplane 1700 arrive immigration 1710 walk out of the airport at 2030 makes SFO officially the most disorganised airport I have ever had the displeasure to arrive sprinkle it with unmotivated rude staff really gives such a poor first impression of what is a fantastic city / country which is a shame!

American Airlines flights to Eugene are out of the American Eagle regional flight annex at LAX, which resembles a third-world airport more than a major US facility. These 9 gates are a long bus ride on the tarmac from the main domestic terminal. They might as well be in Long Beach. There is a huge traffic jam getting to and from these flights, with passengers waiting up to 20 minutes to even board a short bus. The annex terminal has few services, with only a small deli for food. They do have a lounge out there, but were not selling day passes that day, due to construction at the lounge in another concourse. Like most of LAX, you get kicked off the WiFi every 45 minutes, unless you watch an ad or pay.

Everyone knows TSA is slow, but at DFW they take that already high standard and push it even higher. The lines are abysmal. Worry not - staff seems well aware, and they try to speed up the lines by frequently redirecting passengers to other lines. This is where my negative experience begins. A lady in Orange redirected about the last 30 if us to ""TSA Pre-Check"", verbatim. ""Go down the hall to TSA Pre-Check"", she said. A a result we all moseyed our way down to the pre-check line and the line was not short, but it was moving unlike the previous one (when a line doesn't move for 15 min, something is wrong). Those in the group told to move all waited at pre-check until we were at the very front, and only then did a man start yelling at folks that the line was for ""TSA Pre-Check only"", when the lady in Orange clearly told us to wait in that line. Nevertheless we were all relocated to yet another endlessly long line. No signs to mark the line, no staff to usher people to the proper line, and no announcements were made at the appropriate time. As you can guess, many of us missed our flights as a result. This is my second negative experience at DFW, and the reason I felt compelled to leave a review. Everyone understands that security takes time, however DFW abuses that understanding greatly. Sadly one doesn't have much of a choice when choosing an airport , but I'd avoid DFW if given the option. It's not the amount of people that's the issue, it's the rate that they process those people and apparent lack of organization/communication. So congrats DFW, to being one of the largest, and most poorly operated airports in the world."

After check in we had a nice meal at Passports Bar and Grill which was right next to our gate. Finished our meal, got on the plane and flew! Easy! Then there was the return. Not as good. First, we stood in line to check in at the kiosks. Then we stood in line to go through customs. The flight had 200+ people on board and there were two agents to process us. It seemed like a long time. Then finally when we got our bags there was yet a third line to get outside. I honestly have no idea what that last line was for. I thought they were going to check our bags and bag receipts to make sure we had the right luggage, but when we finally got to the front of the line we were just waived through. BWI is expanding their international section with the plan to attract more international flights. If they do, they definitely have to work on their arrival process."

Passengers forced to remain on aircraft more than one hour while airport marshaled buses to drive them around the airport to another walk-in entrance. Baggage transfer location (transfer bags from international to domestic connections) staffed by only one person at desk; another staff gave incorrect instructions causing delays. US immigration required everyone to walk through a Disney maze for 5 minutes even though there were no other customers (late flight); had to use automated scan system; then had to go through another actual line with INS agents to do the same job. Way-finding signage after baggage transfer non-existent. Inquiries to uniformed police resulted in more misinformation sending us to locked doors, stairs without elevators and eventually walking outside to walk to terminal. Terminal design is terrible (as others have commented); but the simplest aides to overcome (signage and staffing). Because we were forced to go outside, had to go through TSA screening again; TSA staff were clustered together talking about their off-times and how long their hours were; and the few working were surly and slow.

I put our information into one of the kiosks and got luggage tags for the bags. However, we were on the wrong line to drop the luggage because we were following instructions that a clueless airline representative had given us.

She refused and told me that people come to the airport to steal phones and chargers, so I was stuck guarding it for more than an hour. When we finally dropped off our bags, we needed to go through security with very aggressive officers who made us take off our shoes despite the fact that we are in our 70s, scanned and wiped down our canes, poked me in the front and back of the knee that had a replacement when I explained it would set off the sensor, and went through all our jewelry in the carry-on luggage. To add insult to injury, we denied a ride on several empty golf carts to our gate. Access to the toilets was closed off at the gate necessitating a walk of 1/4 mile to another rest room. No consideration was extended for us as elderly and disabled passengers."

","  | We went on a trip to Orlando and because we couldn't find a fair price for a flight we opted to fly out of Miami. We arrived at midnight so not much to be said about that. Arrival and luggage was ok as was the transportation to the rental cars. On the way back home however, we 'experienced' this airport. The security lines were horrible. Everyone walks around at an immensly slow speed. One person can't be bothered with helping out others. No real info on who needs to go through regular detection gates and who needs to be bodyscanned. Our carry ons were taken apart after being scanned and it took one single security officer about half an hour before he went through our stuff to check. I don't mind that my carry ons need extra screening for whatever reason but please, do it at a decent speed. The security lines were chaotic at best. Once through security I can't say the airport was dirty but the amenities were very limited as was the seating. Once home I also noticed that the TSA cut the security belt around my suitcase open with bolt cutters, even when it had a TSA lock. And they must have had a key since the suitcase as well had a security TSA lock which was correctly opened. I also put a special cloth sleeve around my suitcase to protect it from wear and scratches which I didn't even bother putting back on. When waiting, there is free WiFi but only for 45 minutes. Great when WiFi was a novelty but nowadays simply incomprehensible. Miami Airport is truly on my to-avoid-list of airports now. I guess when visiting Orlando and the airfare is to expensive, you are even better off flying to Atlanta and drive to Orlando."

Once you figure out how to exit the terminal and go through U.S. security the situation gets even worse. Over 100 passengers were held in a cramped area until 4 in the morning.

I mentioned I didnt like it. Oddly enough a few minutes later I was patted down for my Apple Watch and a nylon zipper on my pant leg pocket. What? Ive worn the same pants through security before-no issues. My son was not patted down for his Apple Watch. The bathrooms at the gates are terrible. No soap or paper towels-gross. MCI-do something!"

First we were forced to stay on the airplane for an extra 35 minutes because customs was clogged. Mind you we already had a terrible flight experience with American Airlines. Upon entering customs we observe chaos. Different TSA employees are yelling at hundreds of customers to direct us all. After finally getting through customs we are yelled at to get our bags, fine. At the third threshold however three more TSA agents start giving everyone three different varieties of wrong directions. We end up missing our connecting flight and at the wrong area completely. More employees continue to curtly tell us we are all in the wrong area (although we had been yelled at to do so) and that we are SOL. We and another hundred customers then waited an additional 40 minutes to recheck in and get new flights. We did not come across one decent treating polite employee during this entire experience. I wish my job allowed me to be rude and discourteous to good paying customers. I have flown my entire life, I disliked this experience more than OHare and will be avoiding this airport at all costs."

I did this and indeed went passed through quickly only to be stopped at luggage claim and customs clearance. It was a mess! Luggage from different airlines were piled on the same luggage belts. After I found my luggage there was a long line of people trying to clear customs. It took about 2 hours to clear customer and when I asked the customs officer why there is such a back log she said the new system made it a mess.

Last time they took my screwdriver expended (length of the credit card), today they took my network cable crimping tool (couldnt explain why). When I asked, they said I can go back and recheck. Sir, you have two options: leave it here or recheck. Mind you, Ive been traveling with the tools all over Canada for many years and passed the security numerous times even thru the same airport.

We look forward to a stop by to say hello on our way back to Europe. They have a very quick and organized system with lots of staff available to keep our flights safe.

I missed my flight despite being at the airport nearly 2 hours before my flight. This was unacceptable handling of the situation by the TSA personnel.

The machines were unmanned with no one on hand to help. It was an absolute shambles. Once we had mastered the machines and taken our printouts, it was into yet another monstrous queue to get through immigration. Orlando airport is an absolute joke.

Flying time between TPA and MIA is just 37 minutes, but weather-related issues made for a TPA departure that was 20 minutes late. On landing at MIA, we then taxied to a halt that lasted 40-45 minutes before a gate was found for us. Pax with tight connections grew anxious as we waited. The AA captain himself lost patience with the false promises of any early move to a gate. A rush to connecting gates and disgustingly dirty bathrooms ensued when we finally deplaned. BA0208 was just starting to board when I finally reached my gate. This was located in a subterranean area of stygian gloom, the waiting customers looking like lost souls, doubtless with their own negative opinions of MIA."

There are not so many restaurants as one might expect, but there is a sufficient variety of dining options. Arrivals: Passport control lines are long, but that is the case in most places. The ""fastrack"" option or using an automated machine and then passing a receipt to the officer actually takes longer because you have to take 5 minutes to use the machine and then join the back of the queue of people who didn't use it. As always the staff shout at you like they are herding cattle. Departures: Check-in is simple and well signposted, queues are short as there are a lot of desks. Security takes a while, the priority line is not much shorter than the main lines. As with most Americans the staff are very rude and unpleasant. One of them pointed at me and shouted ""shoes"" whilst another shook his head and announced to the waiting line ""we shouldn't have to tell y'all the obvious"". It transpired this obnoxious exchange was in fact their attempt to ask me to remove my footwear and place it in the scanning machine, something I would say about 30 percent of airports require, so to me not obvious. But perhaps it was obvious to ""y'all""."

We made our connection with literally one minute to spare after rushing through the airport! Passport checking took an hour and a half and then full security check the same. Many in the queues are stressed as they know they are going to miss connections.

To picture it: Some flights had arrived in a short sequence, there must been more than 1000 people and there were 4 officers, one of them dealing exclusively with a large number of people using a wheelchair. After that he disappeared. People backed up back to the gate. So if more than 3 hours are not enough to get a connection, then I guess you cannot go through SFO at all. I made it with closing doors, sweating like hell, and wishing I hadn't booked my vacation. I booked business to have a pleasant trip, this did not work. Maybe it is some support for the airlines, so that tickets have to bought twice. So: If visitors with a willing credit card and in good spirit to use it are abosutely not welcome, why not close the border completely? Fortunately the nice people on Hawaii made more than up for it.

Barcelona for one, who separate the buses, shuttles, taxis etc from the cars. Its a great stressless experience.

Your mantra seems to be grab as much money as you can from the unsuspecting victims and then wait for them to complain. Shame, shame on you.

Look at Gatwick airport, where they have a hotel in the airport for early morning travelers, where they have a train station that is an elevator floor away from check in. Stressless and a great experience. LAX is a stressful money grabbing people barking orders mass of confusion. Hateful experience. I would like my money back for the excessive price of the bottled water. Shame. When I return I will no doubt have a horrible experience but when I glance at the marble and the glitz of the advertising my thought would be ""why did they spend the money on this instead of finding a way to eliminate the lines, the traffic, the confusion, the miserable employees, the expensive shops and the the most unwelcome airport ever."

But PHL is far from perfect. Many water fountains and electrical outlets do not work: this is a needless frustration. When I arrived at Customs and Border Patrol at around 4PM from an international flight, the area was overwhelmed by too many passengers, almost no help for passengers coping with cryptic passport kiosks, and seriously understaffed CBP posts.

I travel quite frequently for work and Detroit Metropolitan Airport (DTW) is one of the most ridiculous places I transit. This airport seems to consider itself some sort of luxury shopping experience instead of a place to board or change airplanes. Walking through the airport you will notice large selection of expensive name brand stores and high priced restaurants. You will also notice a sever lack of quick and useful concessions. I can't speak for all travelers, but I myself rarely have time during my 1 hour connection time to have a nice sit down dinner at PF Changs and then do some browsing at Swarovski Crystal. What I do have time for is to stop at a food concession that will have my order ready in a reasonable amount of time and maybe for a nice cup of coffee. Neither of these is a possibility at DTW. The severe lack of of basic food/beverage concessions is appalling. Any concession that would be considered ""quick"" is never quick in DTW. The biggest reason is because of the lack of options the lines at the ""quick"" places is often out the door and these places are generally understaffed. On example is the Starbucks located in the A terminal. There are 2 Starbucks for 76 gates, each staffed with 2 under motivated individuals. I have seen lines with over 20 people in them while not surprisingly the Hugo Boss store next door is completely empty. Detroit Airport needs to figure out its true purpose. The purpose of an airport is to provide paying passengers the opportunity to get a bite to eat and a coffee while attempting to make a connection that has most likely been reduced because of weather or some other reason. It is not to sell MAC cosmetics and running gear."

The airline blamed customs new scanning system and mentioned there have been problems for the past few days. We then waited for over an hour to inquire about rebooking our flight. There were only 2 people ahead of us. I don't know what to believe, but know this. We will avoid flights through Canada in the future and will avoid using Air Canada again.

We finally got told that 5 large flights had arrived all at once. I assume this was the schedule and therefore was expected so why could they not either: advise people before they left the plane to be prepared for a wait or have more staff or organise some refreshment in the corridor or even better just advise people of the situation. What was worse was that upon getting the end of the corridor, there was a huge long snaking queue in the customs hall. It took us 3 hours to clear Orlando airport and then we had a 2 hour drive.

The flight information board didn't show my connecting flight either so I had no way of knowing where to go or which terminal I should be looking for. The information desk was unmanned. Eventually I found a young lady who was on a security checkpoint. She advised me that I should make my way via shuttle bus to Terminal 5. Having done so, I then stood for 11/2 hours at security before I reached the gates only to find that there were no flights form my carrier (United). Again, I spent ages trying to find someone to speak to for information. Eventually I found a woman pushing a trolly. She advised me that I should be at T1 as that's where United fly from. By now my 3hr transit window had all but gone. I returned to the shuttle bus and the Queue was over 200 people deep. I approached an official with a yellow jacket on who was supposedly in charge of the queue and explained I have an extrememly short connection, he refused to allow me on the bus and told me to join the end of the queue. I had no option but to barge through or I woould miss my flight. Eventually I made it back to T1 and through security AGAIN and eventually to my gate with 5 minutes to spare. Frustrated, harassed and sweating. An absolute disgrace! No information and some very unhelpful staff. I don't blame the young lady I spoke to at T1, it was not her job and she made an honest mistake but the rest of the staff where totally uninterested and rude."

For international arrivals, passport checks can also be very slow since there doesn't seem to be any correlation between the arrival times of flights and the number of immigration officers on duty. The international departure terminal can get very crowded and hot in the early afternoon, and it can be hard to find a place to sit and slow to get served if you want food.

The majority of the plane were families with young children and had similar experiences, I had a toddler with me as well. Its an absolutely cruel experience for the little ones. We waited over an hour in a room for our luggage, in which three other flights of people were waiting too. We then had to get a shuttle to the main airport to leave, there was no elevators and I was told by the security guard that I could not go on the escalator with a pram/stroller, I had to drag the pram with a toddler in my arms up the flight of stairs, with two security guards watching happily (I was previously told I would be assisted). A security guard was directing the flock of people through to the shuttle inwhich she had physically pushed my sister in that direction due to it being so over-crowded. In all it took us around 4 hours to get out of the airport, as we waited a silly amount of time to get the rental car out as well.

On our boarding pass, it said Terminal CE, but none of its signs stated that, it will state Concourse and a list of letters that did not make any sense to us, which was not helpful at all. Our flight was delayed by 5 hours because the captain was unable to arrive at the Miami airport due to the weather in Tampa, which is completely reasonable. However, the situation could've been handled much better. The people that worked outside the gate were unhelpful. They pretty much expected everyone to have smart phones and therefore were negligent in giving us, customers, regular updates as to when our flight will arrive. They only updated people who stood waiting in line for 15 minutes, instead of just efficiently announcing it to the general public, not that their updates were helpful to the individuals that stood in line because they kept pushing it to every hour, so it was very hard for customers to plan accordingly. By giving us an incorrect ETA, we were not able to decide whether to rebook to another flight or not. If we had known that the flight was going to be delayed for 5 hours, we would've gotten on a different flight. But the people at the gate kept ensuring us that it would only be an hour delayed, and then another hour if we asked again and again. This misinformation is unacceptable. In addition, the airport was freezing. I had to wait in line for 30 minutes at the Service Center for blankets to be told there were no clean blankets. I would check in with them a few more times and was told there were still no clean blankets available, during this 5 hours waiting period, this huge international airport did not think to provide blankets.

They also were disrespectful and made jokes about us like "" can you even see "" and laughed about it with a co worker. I highly advise anyone that plans on a trip to steer clear of this airport."

Parking is a nightmare, the airline staff we have personally dealt with have not been friendly or very helpful and TSA is incredibly rude at this particular airport. I would advise eating anywhere else as the food choices are both minimal and not well made. I am very much looking forward to the renovations being done for this airport as it desperately needs it!"
2018-07-13,2018-07-13,7.0,"""an attractive airport""","  | Twice transited with Air Canada which has its own terminal. Being Australian my baggage was checked through to my final Canadian destination. No immigration/customs forms were given on the plane. No need. There was quite a lot of walking involved to get to immigration, on the way I met a green coated volunteer who kindly told me what to do and the gate of my next flight at 10am (landed 7am). At immigration there are a series of machines where you scan your passport and answer questions. At the end a piece of paper with my picture came out. I showed the lady at the immigration desk area who directed me to the right. Just one person before me, a few questions asked and then I was in, There is a lift to the left that goes up to domestic. There the security people were very impatient that visitors didnt know their ways (ie you put even your carry on in a bin). After that experience I found the unremarkable lounge (worst ever experienced) being crowded, dirty toilets and little to offer. Returning was odd, arrived on the same plane that would take us to Sydney however we had to walk down a long passage to come all the way back to the same gate. Odd. All in all an attractive airport that seems to prioritise its attractive displays over functionality,"

I had a flight that departed IAH at 5.15am on Saturday morning. I arrived at the airport early, as I always do, just in case something unexpected happens. I guess I should've given myself four hours because the line to get into security was around 200 people deep with only one TSA agent verifying tickets and identifications. I waited in that line forever. Then, my flight was scheduled to leave in 10 minutes. I knew I wasn't going to make it because there wasn't enough staff to accommodate the growing number of passengers entering the security line. There was another TSA agent, but he was just sitting there helping the small line of TSA-Pre Check. When there wasn't anyone in the Pre-Check line, he just sat there in his chair and didn't even bother helping the growing line. Once I got up to the TSA agent, she met me with anger. She was rude and didn't even communicate to me with words! She just motioned me to move to the side without any explanation. I had to wait another 10 minutes, and by that time, my flight had already left the gate. I am very dissatisfied with my experience. Why was there only one TSA agent? I'd probably be rude to customers too if I was the only one working that terminal with a line of 200 people and growing. If you're going to the airport, just remember to be there maybe about six hours before your flight, because you never know how short staffed they will be on any given day."

Customs in the UK is so simple and quite quick considering. The staff were so rude at customs in particular at security, they ignored you pretending they were speaking on the radio and couldn't hear. When we had to get our ESTA tickets it was a shambles as we had to do everything in 1.5 hours in time for the connecting flight. Instead of managing the queues one particular staff member kept shouting at me because I was using a different kiosk from my dad, which makes no sense because those questions were long so if there is a kiosk next to him it makes sense to use that - as I did on my way here 5 days ago. Other people were using more than one kiosk but she spent her time focusing on me instead of organising the queue. She kept shouting saying 'Mam Mam Mam' you can't use the kiosk, despite telling her 2 times our connecting flight was soon. The guy at customs was so rude, I'm sure that if you are travelling with a family member you're supposed to go up with them? But, we got yelled at and only my dad was allowed to go, I eventually went up and then a few seconds the customs guy called up another man who was after me - assuming he was my dad, I had to tell him we were not travelling together. In addition, we had to rush through security bear in mind by this point we only had 25 minutes left until we boarded the plane. My dad tried to ask one of the security women a question and she just pretended that she was listening to her radio and that it was so important, she didn't even acknowledge my dad. We kept telling them we were boarding in 25 minutes and no-one cared. Also when they give out blue cards when you go through security - the ones that determine whether you take your shoes off or not/take out your laptop. I just wanted to double check if I needed one as my dad got one and a few people before him did and she just shouted to 'go in that line'. Surprisingly we made the flight, and it was delayed by 45 minutes due to the manifest being typed up incorrectly."

The full body scanner had yellow tape on the front of it with no agent. So he yelled something like ""where is the full body person?"" then he yelled again as I am waiting then he said ""fine I will do it"" and I finally was able to make it though no problems. My wife was not Pre Check and she waited in line for about 30 minutes until she reached the screener. They had very few agents at that time in the morning. When she went though, the machine kept saying she had something in her pant pocket. The pants did not have a pocket so they did a very detailed examination. In the mean time the line was growing longer as a new group of agents were coming to work. It took my wife 45 minutes to make it though - very disappointed!"

When we were finally let out of the plane, we were taken to a holding area, where we waited for another 20 minutes, and because my wife and I had Global Entry, we were allowed to proceed at that point to the passport area. Goodness knows how much longer the other passengers, visitors and US citizens mixed together had to wait before being let into the passport lines, which were long enough that it would have taken at least two hours total from landing for them to enter the country. Once we got to the Global Entry line there were only two machines, and one was out of service. The one machine available did not operate properly for many of those in the line with us and in my case it failed to recognize that I had Global Entry, even though the passport official we finally got to admitted that we did. A disastrous experience overall and a wonder that any foreign visitors arrive in Orlando or US citizens decide to use MCO as their international gateway.

Taking his time casually whilst us pssengers were panicking whether we would make it to our gates on time. Almost every bag being scanned were searched by 3 attendees or so. Creams, food, milk being tested. Gatwick is not family friendly. I would rather pay extra and use Heathrow. Being July, busiest family holiday time, common sense to have more staff to assist the family and special need line. Travelling with kids is challenging enough. Though we arrived at airport way in advance of 3 hours we still had to run for the gates with kids pushchairs and bags at 6am in the morning. This should not be happening at a UK Airport.

Signage there is not as clear as in other airports. Got to ask staff for info most of the time. Most staff are polite and try to help. Similar situation for departure, but signage is a bit better. TSA is much more strenuous than in MIA - put me aside for further check because they ""found something on my clothing"", even though I was wearing just a polo shirt, flip flop no belt and had removed my watch and rings.

The airlines (American) cancelled all flights and American nor the Charlotte airport staff could handle the influx of customers. My main concern for Charlotte is to prepare your staff for a disaster and how to handle a crisis when there is an influx of people in your airport.

I am unsure as to why they had a delay, but imagine it could have been technical - these are overseas planes we are talking about and I am all for them being as safe as possible. The problem was the lack of care I experienced at the airport. When I relayed my nerves about getting to the place on time, the staff seemed apathetic about it. Sure enough, I missed my flight by about five minutes. Like my luggage made it on, but not me kind of close. Now if even one of them had cared enough to offer me a ride or radio the plane to wait, this could have been avoided. Most of them could see that the time was close and even remarked on it, but made no move to actually help me with the problem. But instead, through no fault of my own, I am currently waiting an over six hour layover with no guarantee I will even get on the next flight.

Travelled in by BART train from Pioneer - very easy journey even with luggage as the train terminated at International A - and about 3 minutes walk from the BA check in desks. Couldn't be easier. Checked in and got Pre TSA screened which meant through security in not much time at all. Flight was 4 hours away (the second of 2 BA flights) and flying Club Class so used the BA Lounge. The actual International Departure area after security looked quite small but it didn't have the usual hordes of people aimlessly milling about between the fast food outlets, coffee shops, sports bars and departure gates. Also quite wide so gave an airy uncrowded feel, and had some nice seating areas with tables. Probably would have been pretty dull and boring if we weren't using BA's lounge. It did have a couple of restaurants at the very end of the terminal which actually looked very nice with great views of the runways.

My departing flight was cancelled so I had to reschedule and fly out of Oakland. When I returned my flight was delayed due to construction and one of the runways was closed. Really!

It is not just construction, with SFO there is always some excuse why a flight is delayed or cancelled. I am done! There are other choices: Oakland and now San Jose. I have been delayed and cancelled for the last time SFO. Adios!"

There must be a better way to organise boarding than this. Apart from this, we found the airport OK, but then again we did have access to a Lounge."

There was 1 duty free shop and a couple of dining options plus a couple of vending machines. No bookstore or news stand, coffee shops etc. Pre security offered better options but not by much.

The line snaked around and around. It was moving so we thought the line would go quickly. We were mistaken. The lines snaked through almost every part of the terminal. Down hallways, next to shops, thru other lines, etc. I have never seen such poor management of TSA lines at any other airport in the US. It was simply mind boggling. I attempted to ask a TSA agent about the Pre-Check lines but was ignored. On my second try I was told to move or get pulled out of line. SeaTac is seriously a horrible airport. It's only redeeming quality is it's light rail system that connects directly to the airport and gets you to downtown Seattle easily. Other than that, SeaTac is a horrible mess.

This evening it was Arrivals traffic, but it was spilling over into the Departures lanes, so we were delayed there 15 mins. The people waiting to get to Arrivals mustve had to wait over 30 mins to get there. They need to be better about moving people along and not letting them sit. The Security screening process is a joke, with lines going every direction and no designated person advising people how to prepare to go thru screening. The womens bathroom was so dirty, with toilets clogged, paper towels and toilet paper all over the floor, overflowing garbage bins, soap dispensers that dont work and if you notice the carpet at the terminal, it looks like it hasnt been vacuumed in a week.

2018-08-25,2018-08-25,7.0,"""an abundance of restaurant choices""
","  | I feel like O'Hare gets a bad wrap overall for a few reasons, but some issues are legitimate, and the experience will vary greatly depending on which terminal you go through. For starters I usually fly United, and usually go through Terminal 1 or 2. I don't fly through Terminal 3, and my experience in the International Terminal has only been for one arrival recently. That said, I can break down Terminal's 1 and 2 which are good overall in my view. For starters the main issue with United is connecting flights can take a little while to get around. Terminal 1 is separated into two concourses connected by an underground walkway. In theory you could have a connecting flight on United Express which are mostly located in Terminal 2 despite your regular United flight may land at the C-Gates in Terminal 1. Therefore, you may have to walk from the end of the C-gate to the central area to reach the underground tunnel, go underground the tarmac, pop up at Terminal 1, then go to the end to reach the walkway to Terminal 2, then you'll cross into Terminal 2, and finally you are at your gate. It sounds like a long walk because it is. I recommend at least have 30 minutes to transfer flights. Then the other issues at O'Hare can be queue times for TSA, or some restaurants. I can say from personal experience the TSA at O'Hare have been relatively quick, as in no more than 20 minutes to get through during most times, however, during some peak times such as 4-6 pm, then lines can get long and take over 30 minutes. It has been random since sometimes during ""peak times"" things have been quick. I finally got TSA pre-check, so I'll see how that goes when I fly out tomorrow. Finally the last big issue is the poor wifi. It's Boingo which is too expensive, and at times it doesn't process your purchase correctly. Try to get into a United Club for wifi. I have gone through some personal negatives, and likely negatives for flyers in Terminals 1 and 2. The good news there are pluses. For one, the food choices are good. There are some local chains including Rick Bayless own chain which has solid Tex-Mex sandwiches, and amazing Guacamole. I believe Wow Bao is located in O'Hare, and there is a local tea chain as well. Meanwhile there is an abundance of restaurant choices such as steak, Italian, seafood, cafe food, etc. From my experience I haven't had a bad meal. Keep in mind, don't expect Michelin star restaurants, but if you have a good layover, then you can get a good meal. Finally the bar scene isn't bad, but prices are airport prices. At least Goose island has bars with local tapped beer. Finally the last positive is the location. The blue line connects to O'Hare, 24/7, to the Loop. It's near I-90 and I-294 which help drivers get around anywhere in the Chicagoland area. That said, if you are going to Northwest Indiana, or Joilet, then it'll take a good hour to get there from O'hare. That said, the taxi stand is outdated and slow. Expect to spend a good 30 minutes to get a taxi. Overall it is a good big airport. It's not perfect, nor the best in the world since I've been to LHR to Narita, however, as a large US airport it's one of the better ones in my view. Especially compared to EWR or elsewhere."

Lines can crisscross and you really need to be patient as you go through the process. I had a red eye flight and I wanted to get a meal before boarding.

The sign on the west side said it was closed and to proceed to the opposite terminal. We walked over to the east side and that wasnt open either however there were approximately 20 TSA agents behind the glass. Another passenger walked by and said we needed to go to the South security.

There are plenty of restaurants and shopping areas as well as an Apple store which is awesome. The airport is super clean and transportation shuttles are everywhere so you will always get to your gate on time. I have almost never experienced delays at this airport even during international departures. There is also great Wi-Fi through out the whole airport.

I looked at our boarding pass for the next flight and couldnt find the gate. They do not post any directional signs which is ridiculous. We found a TSA agent for some help and we were informed that it was in another building and would have to be screened again. Couldnt believe it!

It was amazing. Granted, few people were using the app and most were in the long line, but even those in the line were through quickly. Moreover, one no longer has to stand in that awful old hallway as in years past. The passport areas is expanded, brightly lit, and the line is organized and swift. And the wifi works in the arrival area. Second, the departure lounges have been completely redone. There are new marble bathrooms with fresh flowers, plugs at every seat, counter seats to do work and more food options. I was so impressed, I even took photos. Finally Boston has an international airport worthy of the great city Boston is."

We then made our way down to immigration control which was in chaos. There were no proper signs just some people shouting instructions which nobody could understand. We followed people and ended up in the wrong place. After 10 minutes we were then told where we needed to go by somebody we could understand. This was the longest queue I have ever seen, It took us 15 minutes to get to the back of it. When we got near the automatic machines we were stopped for about 15 minutes because the queue after the machines was too long and was clogging up the machine area. When we used the machines our documents were rejected. We later found out that the machines were rejecting 95% of people. This was the basis of the queue. Because of this we had to go in the next queue to be dealt with manually. Altogether it took nearly 3 hours to get through the immigration. Departing was not much better. After checking in, which took about 40 minutes because BA do not have a bag drop option and only 2 desks open for Economy and Premium Economy passengers we were then faced with another huge queue for immigration. It was so long it spilled out onto the check in area. Once through immigration the security check was relatively quick although I had to be body searched because I left a plastic comb in my pocket! It took over 2 hours to get through. One of our worst experiences at a USA airport, although departing from here was also bad a couple of years ago, so a place to avoid."

Herded like cattle for our turn with the TSA agent we waited 45 minutes, (hoping our suitcases would still be at baggage reclaim) to have our passports checked by the surliest, most miserable, rude and non welcoming person I have ever met in another country. He is a very poor representative for America and he could do with a course in customer service. I didn't expect a brass band for my arrival but his attitude was appalling. The return journey was disappointing too, no good eating places and expensive shops, even duty free."
2018-09-06,2018-09-06,1.0,"""Worst airport I've been to""", |  Worst airport I've ever been to. Myself and a few others missed our flight because the airport concierge told us the directions to the wrong gate when I showed him our itineraries. We then proceeded to ask for help and no one that worked there would help us and talked to us like they had no clue as to what needed to be done to get another flight out. Have to purchase another plane ticket out for three days from now. Also extremely hard to navigate this airport. Even the parking lot attendant gave me wrong directions on how to get out of the airport! Extremely dissatisfied. Won't refund my money and was charged for my bags that I had to wind up carrying the entire time!
2018-09-06,2018-09-06,1.0,"""i""ncompetence is staggering","  |  Based on others' reviews, it is evident that the CLT site is fairly consistent in poor service, missed connections, and overall negative experiences. Our flight was delayed due to the President's visit and inclement weather. When we finally reached our gate after sitting on the tarmac for over an hour, we were delayed further due to a lack of staffing to park our aircraft. Once deplaned, we raced to our connection only to find the flight had closed (well outside of the 10-min window of departure time). The excuse provided for the lack of staffing at our arrival gate: lightning and staff safety. Yet, staff were evidently not in any danger to guide our departing flight out of the gate, a fact we found quite interesting. Many customers were left stranded and when trying to rebook flights, the responses from AA workers ranged from eye rolls to terse replies. Never did any employee of the airline or the airport acknowledge what every passenger was feeling. A simple, ""We understand you are upset and we are doing what we can to make the rest of your trip as pleasant as possible."" As we stood in a customer service line, one airline employee passed out customer service number tickets. When asked by several passengers where our luggage might be, she replied, ""Whatever flight you were supposed to be on, that's where your luggage is."" Many people informed her that our connections had already left before we arrived. Yet, she stuck with her (obviously incorrect) statement of next-flight luggage transport, absolutely clueless. We were able to rebook on a flight the next day (2 p.m.) but needed to find something earlier for work obligations. At 11:50 p.m. we left the main concourse, past the TSA area, and headed to the main ticketing counter. Unbeknownst to us (and hundreds others), TSA closes their gates at midnight. No signage, no verbal notice, no nothing. We were locked out of any food, beverages, seating, carpeting, etc. until the airport reopened at 4:30 a.m. We found a quiet place to sit (on the floor, with a locked door next to us) and charge our devices near the baggage carousel. Not long after settling in, an airport employee saunters up and says, ""You gone hafta move from that do'."" As we gather our things to move, the employee then says, ""I don't know why you so upset. You know you can't sit in front of that do'."" Our response: ""Because this airport is horrible."" His response: ""Ain't nobody tole you to come heah."" And this was the basic attitude of every single employee we encountered from our arrival until our eventual departure. We did attempt to make a purchase at the Starbucks at the ticket counter. True to CLT form, the oven was broken and they had run out of the one thing I cared to order. And passengers were due to arrive in less than 4 hours. To be served what remained to be seen. If the presence of a high-profile official and a brief storm delay can render this airport all but useless, an actual emergency will bring the entire city to its knees. There is clearly no plan to address the lack of airport personnel, availability of rental cars, hotel rooms, etc. and neither American Airlines nor the CLT airport gave any effort whatsoever to aid passengers in navigating such a challenging experience. I am committed to avoiding CLT at all costs. The level of incompetence is staggering. Since the airport is owned and operated by the City of Charlotte, I can only imagine what disasters occur throughout the city on a daily basis."

We had booked the Aspire Lounge which was lovely and a great start to the journey. On our return, another friendly member of staff met me and took me through baggage reclaim and security. It made my whole flying experience easy, comfortable and thoroughly enjoyable. I had had my doubts about Gatwick Airport but they were thoroughly dispelled.

The staff were all very polite and helpful but that did not detract from the long 2 hour queue to get through immigration which was awful. Some people missed connections as there appeared to be no mechanism for fast tracking such passengers. Baggage was taken off the carousels long before people arrived to free up space for other flights. Then there was another queue for customs. Baggage back on a conveyor with no information as to where it would end up. Then long walk to find a taxi. At the end of a nine+ hour flight it was just too much. Feel sorry for the people working there!

Thankful we made our flight but continue to be amazed that it took us this long. Will definitely avoid this airport going forward and will recommend the same to others. Very poor management of personnel and systems."

I am really shocked they did not even have a McDonalds, Burger King or Mesn, heck, any restaurant known to offer real breakfast foods, it's really very disappointing that an airport this size cannot even provide sufficient and proper restaurant options.

No podan poner un Mesn, o hasta un McDonalds o Buerguer King, al menos esos ofrecen desayunos como Dios manda, y algo comn y normal en cualquier restaurante del tamao del LMN por todo el mundo, da vergenza ver empanadillas, alitas, hot dogs o dulces en vez de comida verdadera de desayuno."

We checked the airport app upon arrival and the estimated wait time for Gates 1-59 security was 6-10 minutes. So we took our time, got some coffee, etc. My wife checked the app again a bit later and suddenly the wait time was 22-26 minutes. We hurried over and discovered the chaos that is MCO security. Several times, several lines merged into one or branched from one line to several. It was like herding cattle. The last time the line branched we apparently chose the wrong line. It just wasn't moving and when we finally got to the front we find that the bag scanner wasn't working properly. All told, it took me 47 minutes to get through security, but it didn't end there for my wife. Her bag was pulled out to be searched, along with a few others'. I went on to the gate to plead with the gate agent because we were about to miss our flight. My wife tells me that the two bags in front of hers were searched because of 1) Disney picture frames, and 2) a hairbrush. For her, it was a handful of quarters. She ran to the tram, then from the tram towards the gate. Luckily I saw her just as the gate agents closed the door. I told them she was on her way and pleaded with them to let us board. They reopened the doors for us and let us on. TSA was rude and condescending, though. I witnessed it myself but my wife tells me it got even worse after I left. We don't travel to Florida often, but it will never again be to Orlando."

First mistake I made was going into the short-term parking lot. I followed the directions on the self-serve kiosk, inserted my credit card. No ticket had emerged from the machine, but the gate lifted, so I went through. Areas within the parking garage are fenced-off in such a way that it cannot be exited without going the wrong direction in one-way areas. At night, there is no alternative to the ""self-serve"" exit kiosks. I was trapped behind a driver whose credit card was eaten by the machine. The entire line slowly backed their cars up, I pulled into another line, and found to my horror that it was demanding a ticket from the entry kiosk. I jumped up and down, waved my arms, and put on an embarrassing show for everyone as I called for help, which came, nice and slow, looked me in the eye, and politely told me to file a complaint. Here it is."

On September 3rd, we had an international layover on our way to Italy for our honeymoon. There were some weather issues which caused our incoming flight from Seattle to circle the airport for a while before we were finally able to land. No problem, I get weather issues. Once we were able to deboard the plane, we had to find the international terminal. The airport had very poor signage for this, so we stopped to ask a staff. He told us the quickest way would be to go to the end of the G gates and take a shuttle to the M International terminal to avoid having to exit the airport and go through security again. Once we got to G17 where the shuttle was, a female airport worker told us she needed to see our boarding passes and passports. We handed them over and she said she couldn't allow us to be shuttled until she confirmed our flight was still there. I told her that my Delta app confirmed that the flight was delayed by 30 minutes. I had also heard an announcement that all flights were delayed from the weather since no planes were able to take off or land. She insisted on checking Google Flights for her update as well as got on her walkie-talkie to ask someone who was in the international wing if our flight was still there. Meanwhile, the clock is ticking and we need to board our plane. This person who works at the damn airport would not use the airport computer to check our flight status and continued to rely on Google Flights. She told us that she would not shuttle us over because apparently our flight had left. I told her she was wrong and she refused. I was furious. I grabbed our passports and told my husband, ""I don't trust that she is right. I think we still need to make a run for it and go to the international wing by ourselves."" We exited the airport, caught the rail train and went through security with 10 minutes to spare. We finally made it to our gate and what do you know, our flight was still there!

I also feel like this place is outdated in design and convenience. Having to take a bus to get from terminal to terminal is inconvenient and time consuming. There are times I want to get food at the limited selection of restaurants, but don't have time to go because the bus schedules are unpredictable. So then your option is the very underwhelming gas style deli counters and vending machines. I'd understand if this was a small airport, but this is a major international hub. I can honestly say when I book flights, I got out of my way to make sure I never connect to this airport and on the few rare occasions I get diverted here because some kind of airline problem, I always groan."

2018-09-25,2018-09-25,1.0,"""act more like intimidating prison guards""","  | San Diego International Airports Immigration Officers and Customs practices are, with very few exceptions, the worst, small-minded, parochial group of bullies I have ever experienced in all my years of international traveling. They have no idea (and they obviously dont care) that passengers who enter using Global Entry have already gone through extensive background checks, finger-printing and biometric security clearances. The whole point of using Global Entry is to already answer such questions as do you have anything to declare via the automated kiosks and to confirm one is a trusted traveler. Yet without exception, San Diego Immigration Officers demand one hand over ones passport and Global Entry receipt, they take an interrogative attitude, study the passport at their leisure and demand to know if one bought anything or has anything to declare! The whole point of answering the questions at the kiosk is so there is no need to be interviewed by an Immigration Officer! Every airport in America has fast track lanes where Global Entry passengers automatically walk right through, immigration and customs officials simply take the Global Entry receipt, no stopping, no demanding one hand over ones passport, no questions asked. Clearly, San Diego immigration Officers do not want to accept the fast track part of Global Entry as a way to justify their existence to heavy-handedly screen passengers arriving on what is a minute number of daily international arrivals. Almost without exception, they act more like intimidating prison guards and management obviously allows them to act like this with impunity. This practice is unwarranted, unacceptable and completely defeats the entire purpose of the Global Entry vetting process. Another completely overreaching, baseless practice San Diego International Arrivals Customs requires is for passengers to queue up after they have passed through immigration and collected their luggage and have all their luggage x-rayed again before they can exit the airport! No other airport x-rays luggage after one arrives at ones destination! This is such typical San Diego small-minded, provincial mentality. As if pre-flight x-ray screening of luggage from international flights is less rigorous than pre-flight x-ray screening of luggage on domestic flights? How arrogant and uninformed. San Diego wants so badly to grow its international flight business, but it will never be an international airport with the immigration and customs practices they are using. With the above practices, it will remain a back-water, regional little airport staffed by amateurs who relish the idea that they are in positions of power and want to bully people. It is far better to fly out of LAX, SFO or Phoenix where the international immigration and customs teams understand their jobs."

However, the chaos began as soon as we arrived at the Miami airport. My ticket was pre-check as we thought all four would be since they were all booked under my name as the lead person. We were instructed to go to the two different check-points. After being turned around twice, I informed the young lady that we had gone through this twice. If we had to come back, a manager is going to have to get involved. She instructed us to go back to checkpoint three because the staff member there was new and didnt know what she was telling us. We went back, and sure enough, the staff member began to tell us to separate again. I told her what the previous employer had said to us, she pulled up our ticket on her phone and told us to go ahead. I couldnt believe the level disconnect of communication here in the United States; there is a lot to be learned from Liberia Airport. Courtesy and politeness from the employees for starters. We finally arrived at our gate for departure. As we sat there trying to listen for the changes of gates. The intercom system is not the best; one could barely hear the changes. We saw so many travelers missing their flight and upset, as they should have been. The announcement should have been clear, and anyone on that flight name should have been called before that plane departed. I felt bad for those that were unable to hear the message in the mist of all the chaos. Im sure that with all the upgrades in technology the intercom system can be much better, employee interaction should be superior. Staff should act as if they want to assist you and not as if they owe you something, remember we are paying travelers whether by awards or by credit cards we have paid for service and should be treated with politeness, respect, and clear communication."

With flights not serving meals, a traveler can come into the airport famished, with a short layover, and there's nothing. The only place to get a decent comfortable table is Chili's and the food there is simply awful. Plus the staff seem to find the back row of tables by the work station a great place to hang out and share raucous jokes. With five or six of them going at it on my last trip, you could hear them all down the concourse. Trying to pass a quiet hour with my laptop was wrecked by the noise, like being next to a tailgate party. And here's some feedback for the Chili's people. When I was there none of the shouting parties were watching the tables while we customers were craning our necks trying to get menus or drinks or whatever. I couldn't figure out why there were so many employees doing nothing except having fun in mid afternoon when there were very few customers, the cooks were making the food and the bartender was handling the bar. Just one waiter finally started handling tables and while he was very nice he forgot my silverware and water - separate trips for both - and seemed shaky on the whole process. The manager, whom I met briefly, seemed to have no clue that a restaurant, even Chili's, is supposed to serve customers, not double as a social club for staff. As a former restaurant owner, I ranked him as worthless. Anyway, we desperately need a pleasant place to sit with at least decent food that's not just tasteless Chili's fare, liquids, bready pre-made sandwiches or sugary pastries."

I will say that, what I call a Mall with shops and endless food options is fantastic. However the extremely high escalator is ridiculous and the distance you have to go with the tram and the speed at which it goes to the rental car location is way too far and too fast. I have anxiety and the speed is just waiting for a accident as it is way too jittery. And once you are their you have more to walk. I am not old but I did have major heart surgery but for elderly it is not passenger friendly to have to walk that much. This all makes me wonder about choosing a different airport or a different way to travel. I loved when the garage housed the rental cars. It was perfect. I would have kept the 1st and 2nd floor of the garage for car rentals and the top floors for passengers who kept their cars there. And why dont you have stars below for the Tram to the rental facility or the rental car experience."

Sadly Charlotte is the closest airport to my home and is the worst airport I travel through (yes, this includes JFK and CDG). The worst part is the staff are genuinely nice and really try hard but the airport operations are a complete disaster. I have gone through Charlotte 31 times this year and have averaged a 35 minute taxi time. I have missed 14 flights this year trying to go through Charlotte. I have driven home 11 times (I am 80 miles away). Yes, there is perpetual. construction but LaGuardia is much worse there. It is simply they dont know how to route planes on the ground. I am literally typing this as I am taxiing (45 minutes so far). I am baffled that LaGuardia and JFK figured out how to move aircraft in the ground but Charlotte cant. Maybe the air traffic team at Charlotte should benchmark any other airport in the world (I mean this literally) to understand how to move aircraft on the ground. This task is clearly beyond their comprehension. This is frankly confusing in the home of Nascar! It is a shame too because the services on the airport are actually pretty good. Yes, if you have a regional you have to do the march across the world to the E but people are genuinely friendly as you walk so it isnt that bad. So Charlotte. Figure out how to move airplanes on the ground and you could actually be a good airport. But until you do you are not worth the hassle.

The crowds were large. Finally we went back in through another entry door and found the first class baggage check. Now all they do is tag your bags and send you to another line for loading bags. At lest that line was short. Then on to the TSA precheck, again we had to exit the building to stand outside. The ticketing lobby was so small, that they had to have security at PreCheck to let people pass from one side to the other side. Then when the Precheck line was shorter, they would allow you to enter the building to get in line. Rest of the experience was ok. There seems to be a lack of knowledge in at least the employees we talked with, exception HA employees, to be able to guide you anywhere. We heard multiple complaints about this while waiting to figure out where we were really suppose to go. We have never experienced such a lack of organization. The automated walk ways were not functional, bathrooms had inoperable toilets and sinks, enough worked that the wait lines for women were not too bad.

Not only that, when I have to check-in at one of the airlines I regularly use for this particular journey, (as they no longer use London Heathrow). I have to walk miles to get to the check-in desk, and then walk miles again, and go up an escalator, and another long walk to security. Once I've passed through security, there are another set of escalators to use to go downstairs again, to departures, then you have to walk, round and round the duty free shop. Then, if you want to grab a bite to eat, at one of their restaurants, you have to go up another set of escalators! During the hot summer, when waiting at the gates, it was sweltering, as their air-conditioning wasn't working!! When coming back from a UK domestic flight, and getting off at the front of the aircraft, you walk on a short gangway, and then you have to go down the dangerous stairs (which I nearly tripped up on), to get to the buses to take you to the terminal. On the back of the aircraft you can go down their normal steps! I don't understand the logic in that!. When the bus takes you to the arrivals terminal, you can either climb up loads of stairs or take a lift. Once, the doors were locked too soon,and we couldn't get into arrivals; and the contract workers had to get permission from the permanent staff, to open the doors agaiN. When arriving back into the South terminal, from Europe, you have to walk miles to get to passport control, and once you have finally arrived at passport control, there are long queues!! A lot of the automatic machines are closed! It's a hotch-potch and chaotic airport. Unlike London Heathrow, when I recently flew out of Terminal 3, which is far larger than Gatwick, it was streamlined and well organised. From arriving at departures and going through security, it took me 20 minutes. Heathrow, is cleaner than Gatwick. In my honest opinion, they need to build another terminal there, and knock down the dated, South terminal which is totally chaotic. The airports authority, should go and see how London Heathrow, runs their terminals, and see their designs. The terminal signs and directions are a joke, and they are not very clear, when finding the check-in desks, for a particular airline you are flying with. When trying to find the gates, the signs are very unclear."

When we finally reached the security desk the computer system crashed. Basically there was not enough staff either in the arrivals hall or on the security desks.

As I was taking off an outer coat due to the 40 degree warmer weather, I set my purse down. When I gathered my things as the Uber driver came up, I left my purse on the planter. Of course when we got to her house - no purse. My Uber driver was going back to the airport and offered to see if he could locate it when I gratefully appreciated. My daughter went on line to file a lost and found report. We prayed and moments later, a detective  called. They had been trying to locate me for more than 30 minutes. The Security Guard at the airport found my purse and immediately turned it in. When I spoke to the Detective, I thanked him profusely and asked about next steps. He said Lost and Found would contact me the next morning. They did - twice. They confirmed the contents with me and gave me instructions as to how to pick it up. I told them I would come after my daughter's surgery was over and they understood completely. Around 1pm the next day, I went back to the airport and found them - they were already waiting for me. I asked how I could repay them - tips, writing letters of appreciation or what. They said none of that was necessary and asked how my daughter was.

I explained that we were waiting for my dad to exit the bathroom. He waited a few minutes and then told us we couldn't sit there. We left and got separated from our dad who had our passports and could not locate him. I was so appalled that this worker would tell me, a 20-year-old girl, and my younger sister who was 15 that we could not sit in airport seating. It was not a specially designated area, but just a bench outside the bathroom. We had similar interactions with the rest of the staff members we encountered. I would warn any people who unfortunately have to visit this airport that the staff are the rudest out of the dozens of airports I've been to.

Although the staff was pleasant they were inefficient (eg, multiple staff standing around just watching a partner do something) and slow (eg, I had to stand in the scanner for 3 min, just waiting, until they finally scanned me; the bag review process was longer than other airports; employees walked and talked slowly rather than efficiently and also they were condescending asked spoke as if the passengers were 2 year olds). They have not upgraded to the latest screening procedures or machines so that took longer as well, with people being forced to do things other airports no longer require.

Despite most people I know telling me that OHare is awful, I thought it was okay overall - in fact, I found them quite efficient. I arrived in a Chicago on a Thursday. Being Canadian, I was able to breeze past immigration through their automated clearance system, and got through in 10 minutes. The immigration officer had a serious expression, and waved me through really quickly. My bags arrived shortly after I reached he reclaim area. Seeing as my flight arrived 2 hours early, I tried to get switched to the earlier flight, and after the United ground staff dealt dealt with the frustratingly lengthy process of rebooking my flight, she was able to land me a seat on the flight and helped me ensure that my bag would be checked in to that flight despite there only being a one hour window to departure. This also meant that I needed to rush to Terminal 1 from the international terminal. Rushing to Terminal 1 is normally easy, seeing as they have that automated people mover, but its undergoing long-term maintenance/being rebuilt in sections, so its closed on weekdays. This meant that I was at the mercy of the shuttle bus, which was obviously slower to board and arrive, due to the very peculiar traffic design between terminals. There was this one intersection that allowed one bus through at a time and took close to 10 minutes to clear. Despite all that rushing, I was still able to get to my flight in time, partly due to their speedy TSA crew that in dealing with the backlog decided thats passengers could go through with their shoes on. My flight back from Minneapolis occurred without a hitch, though arriving with a 3 hour layover gave me a chance to really soak up the architecture and movie filming locations in the 3 main terminals. I probably couldve also tried their dining, but alas, I have not. When it comes to waiting for flights, the seats at Terminal 1 are old, but adequate. I appreciate their provision of outlets near seating for device charging, but it would probably be even better if they also provided USB ports on the outlets, and fitted universal outlets seeing as travellers may not have the correct adaptors. Also, Boingo is still the main WiFi provider in the airport, but they now offer a few hours of unlimited wifi every time you watch an ad. The ads arent that long, so Id argue that thats okay, and for cost recovery, its not too annoying."

Parking is simple, one of two ramps, Orange or Purple, park your vehicle, walk across the skyway and you are in. If you are on the side with security open, you just walk into security if you do not need to check a bag and you already have your ticket. Once you are through security, find your gate (not that hard, there are only 14 of them) and go get something to eat. The food is good and mostly local to Minneapolis but be aware that the airport's amenities do not open until 5am, the restaurants open later than that. I ran into this problem with an early Sun Country flight to Cancun. Arrival is pretty much just as easy, you'll be in the airport just long enough to get your bags and a cup of coffee and then walk across the skyway and get in your car. Sun Country and Southwest are the primary carriers out of Terminal 2 and there are a few others as well. I do wish Delta would have a few flights out of this terminal, it would make things much easier for some passengers."

Passengers had to run around fetching baskets because the staff werent bothering. Customers in wheelchairs were squeezed through the queues because no one had the foresight to put in a disabled lane. This also caused a significant delay when a frail passenger was asked made to walk through the scanner when he clearly wasn't able to walk. The worst airport and airport staff I have ever experienced. The BA lounge was nice though.

I then had to ask again where said gate was and she then told me that its my fault and I should have gone earlier. Great way to help someone.

We witnessed an elderly woman who was being assisted by one airport associate drop her 3 bags at the bottom of the escalator and told that she needed to go upstairs but lacked the ability to get all of her bags up the escalator herself. She then had to flag down a police officer to ask another associate to assist her who then loaded her bags and brought them up on the elevator for her as the first associate should have done. The signs throughout the airport contradict each other offering opposite directions for where the public transportation and the uber/Lyft pick up is located. Multiple water fountains arent even functioning, among other things. The traffic flow is confusing and disorganized causing massive arrival and departure delays.

Quite a journey due to my heart surgery. There was absolutely no one to help me go from gate to gate, even though they had numerous empty golf type carts. An IAH employee called 3 separate times for a pick up for me but no one ever showed up. This airport is more concerned with the shops/restaurants than with passenger safety.

Overall, it took two hours to get through as a US citizen. After immigration (literally walking through, wondering if I was going to be arrested) I ended up confused and bewildered in Customs with people playing Human Snake around the baggage claim waiting for their turn, which took another hour. The way out was no better, with ridiculous security lines and a rush through screening that must be cutting corners. Seating before security also scarce and the cafes were crowded. Poor, retirement-age volunteers had been brought in to help queuing and give passenger info - a disgrace that they're not being paid. Come on SeaTac, get it together.

Despite being first off the plane we then waited in line for another 2 hours. Customs was also no better, there were a total of 6 CBP lanes open for all arriving visitors. My wife also got a secondary immigration inspection for the apparent reason that she would be staying too long (we were on 2 one-way tickets) despite us both being on the same bookings and me being admitted without question. That whole process took another 90 minutes of waiting for a single CBP officer. So after landing at 5:50pm we got to our rental car at 10:30pm. We will never use this airport again.

However, this airport, given that it serves the needs of New Yorkers travelling to points east of the Mississippi, and Canada, is extremely convenient. A short taxi ride brings you to the airport. The distance from the entrance to the gates is very, very short. Thus, you save a lot of time. From being dropped off at the entrance gate of the terminal to the TSA check area, it is less than a one minute walk - if you have your boarding pass with you. The gates are immediately thereafter. I am sure once the new terminals are constructed, the walks will be long and I will have to trudge long distances to my gate. I used Terminal B for a United flight from Gate C9. C9 is at the end of the terminal pier. So this is a very convenient, straight forward, quick terminal to use. In less than 5 minutes, including TSA inspection I was at my gate! I did not check any bags. Ample seating and quite a few electric connections to charge your phones all around. At this end, with the large glass windows, not only is the waiting areas bright, thanks to natural light streaming in, you can see flights landing and taking off. I was given TSA pre-check and going through the security inspection was a quick walk in the park. I did not have to pull out my laptop or liquids or even shed my coat or remove my footwear; I had put the phone in my bag. Food stalls after TSA are few but basic snacks and sandwiches are available. A little bit of research before coming to the airport can help travelers prepare for the services available and thus manage expectations. While the airport currently handles more traffic and passengers than it was built for, this is the airport where you can be at your gate from arriving at the terminal in just a few short minutes. A great convenience to busy, on the go New Yorkers!"

It took about 20 minutes before we got to the TSA desk at which time they told us we had to leave and go to the other check point. We then waited in line another 20 minutes to get to the security screening in the second checkpoint line. Our complaint is that first the gate should be printed on the boarding pass as clearly the TSA counter had this information 20 minutes later. Second, there is no signage or employees going around checking to inform travelers they are in the right checkpoint. We all expect some wait at the airport but things like this are simply maddening! Further, when we talked to the TSA folks, they rolled their eyes like this is a very common thing and they wished it wasnt that way. So my question is this, why isnt the airport leadership taking this on as an issue to be corrected? Also, the gates for Delta were super crowded! We had to stand the entire time waiting to board, which isnt easy with small children."

Then once we arrived at the baggage claim to get the bag we didn't want to have checked to begin with, we waited another 30 minutes on it to arrive! Then you go outside and continuously get screamed at to move to a certain location and they basically don't want any cars to stop.

Again, no big deal, we all have flights and we should be able to get through pretty quick, right? Nope. They had one, I repeat, one person checking IDs for both general and priority lines. One flipping person that was also taking her merry little time and then they had one line open to go through the security and have bags scanned for 2 long lines of people. Holy hell did we all barely move. Around 04.30-04.40 they finally started opening up TSA precheck line. We asked if we could jump to that line since we were TSA precheck. We were literally ignored and they walked by and let another long line of people come up and start through their line. We even had people in front of us asking if they would make their flights on time because they were needing to get to their gates for boarding. And they were ignored. Okay, now lets jump to when we finally got up to go through security (around 04.40 when we needed to be boarding at 04.45): again, its me my husband and our two kids. Took forever to even get us through the scanners. We get through the metal detectors and now we have to wait for our bags and car seat. TSA pulls every one of our bags for a check. Its probably because of the formula and kids snacks. Nope. They wiped everything down and then told us they had to open every single one of our ready to feed formulas to make sure they were actually formula. The formula was still sealed! And if you are at all familiar with RTF formula, once opened it goes to a short expiration date. So all of our formula for the trip now was being moved to a 24-48 hour expiration date assuming our cold packs kept the cooler cold enough, if it didnt, they put all of our formula expiration to 1 hour. Its not like we could find formula around the airport for him if he gets hungry since our formula is no longer good because you had to break all the seals! So here we are getting progressively more and more angry as we are also supposed to be boarding our flight at the other end of the airport. So I take the kids and start heading/running down to our gate while my husband waits for them to finish opening all of our formula up. We literally get to the gate as the last people to board. Never again!"
2018-11-25,2018-11-25,3.0,"""one of the worst""","  |  Its amazing how the airport authority has taken one of the best business airports in the country to one of the worst. Rental cars are insane distance away. Then the walk to the rental car pick up shuttle is just as bad. TSA is slow and the agents care more about who did what last night than moving things along quickly. They are among the most unfriendly in the country. I always fly Southwest out of BWI. Either to there or changing planes. They also have the distinction of having the most unfriendly southwest agents working the gates. Attitude and could care less about customer service. If this hub changed I, as well as a great number of road warriors would welcome the change. I use other airlines as much as possibly now to avoid this airport. And you want attitude or poor customer service. Get a cab at the airport to one of the hotels in the hotel zone. Yeah, maybe i dont want to wait in the weather for a shuttle bus. God Forbid. The cab drives are rude and will have meltdowns when you tell them where you are going. I tip hefty and would have done more for them than most...but not when they cop an attitude. Again, one of the least pleasant airports to fly into. Make it even better, utilize the end of Concourse C and no moving sidewalks. "

Commands were shouted and if not complied with immediately further abuse was received. I purposely wear a plastic belt to enable easy pass through security but an officer barked at me to remove it. I accidently left a dime in pocket and this gave me the pleasure of a full body pat down and hand swab. My carry on had to re x-rayed because I failed to separate all items as requested and I was suitably chastised for my inability to complete their orders. In addition they insist on shoe removal, even when there is no metal in them, but there are only a couple of metal seats to assist in re-shoeing. In conclusion I hope this situation with the TSA improves as this experience has left a bad taste in mouth after a fantastic few days in Las Vegas."

Which terminal, East or West? I got asked that for 2 pickups and nowhere does it say East or West. The hotel transport lady finally asked what color signs I as looking at. Nowhere does it say you will be taking a train to baggage. I went on an escalator and was by myself in a small highway. Apparently this was a train waiting area with no one there and no signs. Scary to say the least. Go to level 5 which turns into level 6 and after you take 2 elevators, an escalator and a moving walkway you might find a gate that also has 3-4 flights out of one gate and they are all leaving within the hour.

That said, SFO is a terrible airport, and if we had a better choice we'd take it instead. Firstly the international terminal is leagues behind its counterparts in most any other city. And as we specifically travel to western Europe and the UK SFO does not compare to any of them overall. Coming back home the differences are so glaring; it's like night and day. SFO's international terminal is so tiny, post security dining is extremely poor. Not to mention expensive. They don't even have a well-stocked newsstand. Worse, however, is the TSA and immigration staff. TSA staff members can be pretty rude and abrasive especially to foreigners I'm sure. We're used to the attitude, but it makes a bad impression. Immigration is either hit or miss mostly the latter. And don't even ask about customs officials. They profile certain races which is not only archaic but unfair. How many times the immigration officials allowed us clearance only to be abruptly stopped near the exits by some Oriental customs official who thinks that because we look like them that we are lying about what we listed on our customs declaration form. We always note down everything we are bringing back & we are always within the monetary limits as well as we do not bring back contraband items. Yet these agents think they are so smart to do this profiling whilst the true perpetrators have been allowed to go. It's time to do away with this third world mentality and if they want to search then they need to do it to everyone and not just the ones they want to profile. So for everything I wish there were a way to rate SFO with minus points. Since that's not possible then a 1 is the best they deserve."

The bathroom looked like it hadn't been cleaned since the day before, and the part that made me furious is that they threw out my toothpaste saying it wasn't allowed since they don't let you take in liquids over a certain amount, but one of the gate TSA people let a pilot carrying four cups of Starbucks coffee through the security door without hesitation. This is the peak of stupidity. All this about how they're making things safe for us when everyone knows the TSA is staffed by people who wouldn't make it at McDonalds."

I know airports are always a little more expensive but thats excessive. I saw the same bottle of water in another terminal for $1.75, if that gives you an idea of how ridiculous these prices are. Theres also very little shopping that appealed to me, and if theres a duty free store I must have missed it. Definitely going to avoid ever coming to this airport again.

One of the see-thru boxes had been opened, the plastic seal removed along with two pieces of candy. Are you kidding me! Because the candy was in see-thru plastic containers it was totally unnecessary to open the box and remove the plastic seal. Crazy. Also, I had a bottle of liqueur padded with plastic on two sides and taped in place so the inspectors could clearly see the labels on the front/back of the bottle and see exactly what it was. They removed all the padding and didnt bother to tape it back on after inspecting it. Its a miracle it didnt break and spill all over the contents of my suitcase. Why cant they repack items the way they found them? This isnt SeaTacs fault, but some of the TSA people working there reflect poorly on an otherwise excellent airport."

Xray machine broke and instead of letting us know they had started moving our stuff to another line we were all just standing around looking at each other wondering whats going on.

I knew going in that DTW would be even busier with it being Christmas. When I got inside, the check-in kiosk for Delta did not recognize any of my information. This occurred in Greenville when I flew to Detroit on 12/21/18. I stood in a very long line for 30 minutes before reaching the check-in agent. The check-in agent could not help me at all and said I needed to go stand in ""a special line."" So, I go and I stand in another line, this time for maybe 15 minutes. Remember, I have a toddler, a car seat, and a carry on bag I am trying to handle by myself. This special check-in employee was able to check me in. Apparently because I had a minor flying with me, that is why the kiosk would not allow me to check-in. Then I was told that while they could check the car seat for free under Delta policy, I would need to walk to the other side of the Delta check-in terminal and place it with the oversized luggage. Now I had to walk across the terminal to drop the car seat off and then walk all the way back to the other side I started at in order to go through security. Again, remember that I am one adult trying to manage a car seat, a toddler, and a carry-on bag. I finally get back to the other side of the check-in terminal and to domestic security check. Thankfully we were able to get through security rather quickly. Then you have one TSA agent who was literally having almost every bag in his line be checked. I had a back pack and a carry-on that needed to be checked, which means additional wait time because only one person was there going through items. I know TSA has to do their jobs, but this agent was flagging almost every bag going through (I watched him with the bags before and after ours). Yes, I had toys from Christmas morning we were trying to get home to SC. I have flown in and out of Detroit numerous times to visit my family in MI. I have never experienced such frustration and utter anger with Detroit as I did yesterday. Dtw is not made for parents who are flying solo with a child, plain and simple. There are no courtesy strollers or luggage carriers with a child seat attached. When I expressed my frustration to a Delta agent about being a solo parent trying to fly with a minor and being told to wait and then walk all over the airport, all I got was backlash about how everyone has to do it. It is not hard to be parent/child friendly."

I am not sure what the training procedures are for this place, but for any establishment to allow their staff to talk to their guests like this is wrong. Reading other reviews I am not the first to experience this. I am not sure who is running this place, but just because you are airport security doesn't give you the right to be a complete jerk to anyone.

It is on a par with Miami International Airport which I now refuse to fly to even for connecting flights. Once we had landed in the North Terminal it took us one hour and twenty minutes to collect our bags and connect to the South Terminal as well as having to walk for something like 15+ minutes to reach immigration. The airport is really badly laid out as well with the need to go up and stairs or using escalators several times on the way. The direction signs are poor and not always readily visible. The Fast Track facility was heavily overloaded - it was almost quicker to use the standard facility for your hand luggage control and the staff are not particularly helpful or friendly and the standards seem to change each time one goes through in terms of what needs to be removed from your hand luggage to be controlled separately! Why this is the case is difficult to comprehend. Passage through the airport once one is through immigration etc. is like slaloming on overcrowded ski slopes. Quite frankly there is nothing positive to say about this airport which seems to get worse each time we have to through it! One word of advice is to use Heathrow or London City wherever possible and if you use Gatwick you should avoid taking a connecting flight as with luggage you need plenty of time - probably two hours - particularly if you need to change terminals. To summarize a very frustrating and depressing exercise!

I figured I'll just take the ""exit"" sign and loop around. Wrong, this took me clear out of the airport. As I was paying my toll and bitching to the attendant he told me I could take the immediate first left turn and go back in. OK, fine - except - I was at the stop sign and needed to cross 20 lanes of onrushing cars to get to the rightmost lanes on the entry side - the ones for people paying cash.

Most modern airports (we live in Denver and use DIA regularly, but have seen it at most other parts airports as well) have seats that charge, so every passenger has the opportunity to do so. In this information age, we all use our devices for everything from business, to email, to boarding passes, to transportation (Uber, etc.).

Arrived at 10 pm on January the 7th from Panama and went directly to immigration line (visitors). Very disappointed to see that there were only 2 agents allocated for our line, while that line for locals had more than 7 agents. As a result it took us more than 1:30h to pass the immigration controls. Then, they took me to the customs office with the excuse of having a common name (they didn't provide more explanations but the way the agent explained didn't sound very convincing, besides it was the first time that it happened to me in US territory). Time spent in the office, 30 minutes. After the office I finally got to pick my lugagge, only to discover that it had to go through a 2nd security check and that we had to pick it in another terminal. Sadly when we got to the pick up terminal, part of the lugagge didn't come out. Nobody from the airport or airline was present to assist us. I asked to another passenger in the same situation and he told me that this messy inconvenient was really normal in the airport. We sat for more than 1 hour besides the belts, until the last bag finally came out. It took me 3 hours to fly from Panama to Orlando and incredibly it took me more than 4 hours to try to go out of the Airport. These guys have no idea of customer experience. I know security is a priority but it doesn't give them the right to provide such a poor service. If I don't know how to treat my guests I simply don't invite them."

No passengers put there luggage while we were there they all struggled and all helped each other carry their luggage back to the main terminal. Ive been to many Airports across the world. Never have I ran into an additional 3 hour process at the end of customs in any airport at any country. What a waste of big money. why did not the airport let the cart vender rent carts out there rather than spend millions on conveyors that no one will want to use. Also no signs or instructions regarding this portion of the process. It was a melt down just waiting to happen every 10 minutes. They had such a nice appearance when we departed, arriving was a nightmare more than anywere Ive been in 30 years. The staff seemed to try to manage dealing with the ridiculous process.

My family went through without a problem but I was detained due to no Identity (no license). The Lead Traffic Controller was notified and arrived within a 1-2 minutes to question me. He was professional and very kind. Because I did not have any identity, He had to get an Identity questionnaire which took only another 1-2 minutes. I could tell he was extremely busy as his Communication radio was going off, but he took it in stride and actually lowered the volume so he could give me his full attention. He called Washington and after answering a few questions I was able to sign the form and go through security. He guided me through the security process, searched my bags. His biggest challenge was finding a female officer to pat me down. He had to rotate some Male officers around in order to free up the female officer. I was amazed how smooth he worked and how respectful the other officers were to him. Finally, I was cleared and was able to reunite with my family. I was most thankful to him and all the staff. They are all working so hard with minimal staff during this difficult time with the Federal Shutdown.

I literally missed a connection because of the inefficiency of having to go from one terminal, to the other, and I had 45min to do so. Also gates are often switched at the last minute due to staffing and scheduling issues which forces you onto the archaic shuttle system between terminals.

Once through security, you are guided into an extremely overcrowded waiting area with very limited vendors (similar to MCI, you have to go outside of security to get something to eat).

Everyone was forced to be in a rather limited area of the arrivals ""kiosk security/whatever"" area. Standing in what more and more became a chaotic line as there were very poor instructions or any hints of where to go and what to do. Everyone waiting to find an empty kiosk where you had your photo taken and answered all sorts of questions regarding your stay.

No signals or signs to see which kiosk was available or not, those further away were all empty since nobody saw them in the first place from where the line was entering that area. This was for all non-Canadians. After finishing that chaotic mess I was even confused and walking in circles for a bit to figure out where to head off next. Finally did and handed my passport and a receipt-like ticket with the photo and questions and answers I just did at those kiosks. Only to have the security person ask me MORE and even the same questions I already answered.

Passengers were limited to the use of two computers for mandatory self processing (scan passport, take your photo, declaration questions...) at the first check point. I heard an agent say this was to slow down people getting to the next backed up line at the customs counter. An efficient agent should have announced those needing to make a connecting flight have priority, and then got them to the front of both lines. The customs backlog created bags lying around baggage claim. Self absorbed and rude staff in that area were too busy talking with coworkers to answer my desperate need for directions; a body scanner was down when I finally reached the congested security check point for my next flight. A lot of staff standing around instead of reloading needed trays. Never saw one cart and driver, so had to run to final destination. Again, an efficient manager could have projected the need to have carts and drivers available to assist those of us trying to make connecting flights. Yes, signage is lacking or poorly done; yes, too many staff are without basic customer service skills, lack creative problem solving skills, and take no initiative. Denver airport needs an intervention."

Now in midnight I am still waiting for transit flight. I was going to Chicago as a visitor, holding Canadian passport. The officers suggested that I wanted to emigrate to US, just because I don't currently have a job. Reactions are very rude! I told them I will be supported by my parents, they asked many personal and nonsense questions, including do I live with my girlfriend, and what's my parents' job, suspecting how much they earn. I just don't understand! Do parents need to be millionaires to support their own child's basic living expenses? Asking me for I-20 when I am no longer F1 student. Luckily I brought it with me. And later told me that I don't need to show it to them.  Maybe it's their job to ask questions, but they had no right to judge people. Especially when they knew that I had worked before, but because of my current status, I cannot work in US. Finally, they called me the last time and let me go, when it's five minutes after my departure time. No apology. My airplane was gone. Truly awful experience!"
2019-02-04,2019-02-04,1.0,"""An awful experience""","  | Oh dear no. An awful experience. When you stand in a queue for an hour and 15 minutes with no access to a toilet and nowhere to sit it leaves a bad taste. I have to remind myself as meander like Im in a queue at Disney that we are meant to be in the most advanced 1st world country on earth. I mean the citizens of this country landed men on the moon 50 years ago and sent satellites to the furthest edges of our solar system yet they cant efficiently push people through airport arrivals. So after an hour and 15 minutes in a queue we were put into an area of robotic machines by semi robotic staff. One must put the four fingers of one hand on a glass plate on the machine, feed their passport into a slot and look at a light for the machine to take your photograph as if you are facing prison. The machine then spits out a paper ticket with your photo and passport details. In our case although the ticket told us to proceed out one of the semi robotic staff put us to another darn queue. This one took another 45 minutes and when we got to the counter we got to do it all over again. Thats to say, fingerprinted, photographed and passport examined. So what moron thinks its a good idea to push hundreds of people to machines only to then put them to human beings to do the exact same thing all over again? Insane duplication and a complete waste of time. I think the Germans call this verschlimmbesserung. So two hours with no access to water, toilet or a seat and to make matters much much worse was that whenever airline crew arrived they got preference over us to go through immigration with no consideration for the fact wed been standing for hours. When I arrived at the airport I had a lot of sympathy for the folks working here because with the 21st century reincarnation of PT Barnum in the White House they werent getting paid but by the time I was standing an hour I felt I wouldnt pay them either. Barnum may be on capitol hill but arrivals at Miami airport was a horrible circus all of its own."

Then the male personnel at the customs was also rude when he pointed us to the secondary inspection. He said ""go to letter a, dont you know letter aaaaaaa?"" We are Filipino American professional friends who vacationed together and we are slower but not dumb. We understand the letter a. We were treated way better in other international airports and to be treated this way by our fellow Americans is just unacceptable.

We came from Incheon airport and I accidentally forgot to eat a fully wrapped individual banana and the male personnel made it appear a intentionally committed ""crime"". He asked for my passport back and obviously typed something on the computer. When I asked whats with the passport, he said ""what we do with your passport is none of your business"".

I was disgusted at this and how these people are a representation of your country, something needs to be done about the way they approach and interact with passengers.

2019-02-15,2019-02-15,1.0,"""worst airport in the modern world""","  | The worst airport Ive ever had to navigate. We had a 3 hours layover where we were coming in from London. 1. Air traffic control had us circle for 20 minutes. Ok, that happens. 2. Once we landed we were stuck on the tarmac for 40 minutes due to another plane not having docked correctly? and lack of communication regarding which gates the preceding planes were to be at. This doesnt really happen much, so it was frustrating. 3. We had to go through two different rounds of security screening before having to pick up our checked bags. At the first one, even though were had the mobile passport completed, there was no line for mobile passport and with 6 kiosks only 2 were open; one exclusively for crew and global entry with the other for everyone else. 4. We had to then collect our luggage, which took another 30 minutes, to be randomly selected to have them rummage through our things. 5. Once they unfolded everything and left it a mess we were dismissed and sent towards the exit. We then had to recheck our bags at the airline desk which was on a different level and a long way away. Luckily, an airline staff member allowed us to skip the line and simply drop the bags. This was the one person who was helpful; airline staff. 6. Next we had to go through airport security again, however, this time it was the same security you go through if you were just arriving to the airport. Keep in mind we had just gotten off of an airplane here at the airport. Once in the line we got to hurry up and wait while 6 TSA employees condescendingly yelled at everyone. Nothing helpful from them, just threats to slow the line if their power-trip-orders werent obeyed. If someone failed to zip up their backpack before sending it through the scanner, instead of asking them to zip it, the person was chastised in front of the crowd. 7. The line of travelers constantly growing while the Walmart approach (having many registers with only one open) was adopted by the TSA staff. One screening conveyor belt was in use while 3 others were closed. With the exception of the lady who was running the conveyor belt, who would not make eye contact with anyone even when asked why my sealed clear bag from the duty free store back in a London was set aside. Nope, my duty free items needed to be taken out and run through another scanner. 8. What was the rest of the TSA staff doing? Literally walking around in circles not know who was supposed to do what. I heard hey, who is on this one? And I though so and so was supposed to be here still along with other statements that really reassured me our safety was the priority and was being handled by professionals. 9. We were reassured that once through this last security check that the gate was literally just up another escalator. Nope. Next we had to jump on yet another shuttle. 10. Whats the best part of this whole experience. The arrival gate (e24) was in the same terminal as the departure gate (e31). All of that fuss was to go through customs. In short, this is the worst airport in the modern world to deal with and I will gladly pay more to fly through another airport in the future so that I can avoid this from happening again."

Children's play areas, art works, big and clean signage - all abound. Free wi-fi, lots of seating, clean toilets. I arrived quite late at night - after midnight. Without checked luggage I was able to exit the airport without any delay. Cabs waited in line outside the terminal - they accept credit cards. On return, I arrived a bit early because of bad weather. Thus, I had time to walk around to explore the airport. I was impressed. Shops carried local Native Canadian art work and there were both fast food and more formal eateries. Like many other Canadian airports, Vancouver also provides pre-clearance immigration and customs entry into the U.S. However, for the flight I was taking, because it left after 10 pm, this service was not available. I was directed to another gate on the other side of the terminal. I ended up doing the immigration and customs at my destination in JFK - as with everyone else on my flight. Security check was similar to the US and was unhurried - at that time I was the only person undergoing a check! Once you are through the security area, you are greeted with numerous shops. A wonderful airport - large floor to ceiling glass panels offer beautiful views. I generated the boarding pass and the lounge pass from a vending machine. I used the Cathay Pacific lounge which is on one floor above. Again, great views. Lounge hours are limited to arrival and departure of the company's flights.

And for some reason you have to show an airport employee your passport to get into the immigration queue - creating another bottleneck. And after clearing immigration and customs you are then dumped out into a little arrivals annex far from the rest of the airport and normal terminal services - requiring a 10 min walk to the taxi or uber areas.

Departing wasn't so bad, except that I couldn't find a functioning water fountain even though I walked up and down two concourses looking for one. When I asked I was sent to one that was out of order. It is returning from Mexico that is horrendous. Even though we have Global Entry and TSA Pre, we invariably are sent on a wild goose chase (the employees don't seem to know that TSA Pre in Houston is closed and they always sent us to a different building so we can go through TSA Pre). We end up running like mad, trying to grab a sandwich and still making it to the gate in time to board. I suspect the TSA worker at Houston are some of the unhappiest. I would be too, working in such a poorly managed environment."

Just about then the tears starting coming, thinking I couldnt board my plane and get home. Home sounded pretty darn good about now. All of a sudden the New York hero swoops in holding an I-phone, that suspiciously looks like mine, and proclaims someone found an I-phone. I took the phone, uttered a million thank yous. That didnt seem quite enough and I hugged Mr Hero. Still overcome with gratitude, I threw my hands up in the air and shouted  I love New Yorkers. The security guard confirmed it New Yorkers are really nice people. With that, I walked away with my happy ending thanks to the heart of New York... its people. "

One officer for 4 wide body aircrafts. Where are all the officers? Sleeping, chatting, taking a break? Welcome to the service desert called USA. Any questions raised are replied like you are a criminal, rude and agressive. Overall that gives any arriving visitor a good impression of what to expect within this snobbish and rude country. Try to avoid whenever possible. B.t.w., lack of immigration officers is common. At another time I experienced that 2 out of 53 counters were open."

Every so often one of the people manning the booth would walk away for about 5 minutes leaving just one booth open. It was taking an average of between 3 and 5 minutes per person going through immigration. There were other staff members wandering around but nobody seemed to take charge. It took us around 2 hours to get through this fiasco but by this time the queue was about 4 times bigger than when we arrived and one of the booths was about to close because the lady was going for lunch.

I was absolutely amazed that in a country renowned for its customer service, this was allowed to happen - where were the management, or at least somebody to take charge and get additional staff in."

All this to return to the same terminal we started at, only two gates over. We ran through the terminal and were late for boarding.

I don't think they were passengers, as they were far removed from baggage claim and ticketing. As far as I know, there was no weather - or airline-related reason for people to be sleeping in the terminal. My daughter reports that the sewage stench is prevalent at her gate (A15), so this isn't just an isolated situation. What's the deal, DFW?

Not traveling on business this time, I was an economy passenger and I experienced this in such status. Basically, Terminal 3 is just a vast, overpriced shopping mall, crammed with every high-end store imaginable, with limited seating and limited amenities that I could see, e.g., USB charging ports for cell phones. One has to sit in a crowded, central seating area where gates are not announced until around 40 minutes before the boarding time. Once a gate is announced, it can be a 15-20 minute trek to a gate, even with moving sidewalks. And beware, there are very few toilets! The signs for the toilets take you on a yellow brick road kind of odyssey which can encompass a 10 minute walk through a maze of stores, unless I missed something, there is only one near the entrance to the mall after exiting security. There are no toilets near or at the gates, which, as I said, can be very far from the main seating ""pen"" so to speak. Also, the security lines can be long. When the airport web site states ""arrive 3 hours before departure"" there is a very good reason for that. I travel quite a bit internationally, and this is the first airport review I have ever written. But, I feel compelled to do this to warn others. I was very disappointed."

Its a long haul travellers nightmare. This service would simply not run in the UK- it makes our busiest airports in London look timid by comparison. First off if youre catching a connecting flight through here good luck, the airport is huge and it is not clear where youre supposed to be going. Not great when this is your first time here. I was stood in a customs queue that wound on forever until I got panicky my connecting flight was in 40 mins. I stepped out to inform them and they told me to go over there. I wander over to a desk and a rude lady asks what Im doing and I need to scan my passport first - well sorry the man did not tell me that! Wouldnt it be helpful to tell me? They start whispering in another language and exchanging looks as if this isnt an airport where new people enter every single day. Im not thick thanks. Then comes the icing on the cake - the ever so fun customs lady who dragged her feet over to man 1 of 2 customs desks. She tells me she needs to sit down first and takes as long as possible with an attitude. Sorry I know the job is stressful but suck it up lady. Then she starts getting really intimidating telling me Im not stood near the camera enough and Im telling her sorry Im flustered as I need to catch my flight. She seems totally unsympathetic and continues being rude. Sorry but I just got off a 7 hour flight from Manchester and I had 30 mins to get through security and to the gate - excuse me if Im a little disoriented by your awful airport! She then makes me scan both my hands at least 11 times and it was very clear she was doing it to toy with me. I mean seriously who employs these people. Luckily I kept it together to avoid trouble but I have never met such rude airport staff in my life! Im so glad I wasnt travelling to NYC because boy what a welcome to that city. I know New Yorkers are known for being brash but they were just simply obnoxious and unprofessional. Boy was I glad to get to LAX in sunny California where the staff were lovely and helpful. Ive never been particularly interested in NYC and its -10 weather as it seems like a more aggressive version of London and this airport just confirms my opinion on the place."

Some person who is not customer facing decided not to use the aircraft stands nearer the main area and park the easyJet flights next to the A380 from Dubai, compounded the problem at the border with the lack of gates open. Maybe the airport management should stick to playing with a Lego City airport as they seem to be totally unable to operate a real airport. I have never seen a member of a railway station staff open the barriers and wave people straight though the barrier. Maybe its a plan to exact excess fares from people at the other end.

We set out from a domestic terminal at one end of the airport to the international terminal. We had our suitcases in a cart and kept asking employees which way to go. When we reached the end of the building, I asked a group of chatting employees how to reach the international terminal for our flight to Singapore. The female of the group said to go outside and walk about ten minutes and we would be there. She could see my cane, there is no doubt we are elderly and that my husband was pushing a large cart of four suitcases. I asked if that was the only way since it was raining outside and she smiled and said yes. She gave us no indication that there are shuttle buses for travelers so we started walking. It might be 10 minutes for a young person, but it took us at least 30 minutes. Time was not a problem, exhaustion was. We finally made it to the international terminal where there are very few seats...maybe one per 50 passengers. Our airline counter was not yet open so we stood and waited as seats became available. After a couple of hours, I needed to find a restroom which was a very long walk from where we were. No seats and no restrooms. Once we checked in, we were told that it was a very long way to our gate. That was an understatement. Our airline, Singapore Airlines, was the last gate at the farthest end of that terminal. We walked and rested and walked and rested. We were passed up by many carts carrying people. How are you supposed to get a cart? I had asked before we flew if we could get them and was told you just had to happen upon them. We never did, but others sure did. Later I realized that many people waited at the plane upon exiting and the carts were brought to them yet I was told this could not be done for us. The capper to all of this was when we were finally allowed to board, we were taken out into the rain and very strong wind to a bus, from the bus, we climbed stairs onto our plane. I felt like I was back in primitive 1970s Iran. Upon our return, we had a very tight connection and had to get from the international terminal to a domestic terminal. The first employee I saw when we deplaned was a nice man who handed us two orange express connection passes. We took those and rushed for our baggage so we could go thru customs before boarding a domestic flight. We thought those passes would help, but they served no purpose whatsoever. We went to the back of the line just like everyone else. They would have signs directing us to the express connection lines, but they were no faster than regular lines. At least this time I found a kind employee who told us there were shuttle buses we could take to the domestic terminal. That was very helpful, but we rushed as fast as we could and were told there was no way we could make our flight. We will never go thru LAX again. Why no help for disabled travelers? Why do you have to go outside to another terminal? Visit Changi airport in Singapore to see a truly amazing airport. They have lounges you can sleep on, free foot massage machines, clean restrooms, lots of seating, helpful employees and even a nature walk. Even the tiny airport in Dunedin, NZ, is better organized and cleaner than LAX. LAX is crowded, dirty and poorly planned.

The conveyer belt is the shortest I have seen which means all the baggage piles up until you are through the security check. Their website is wrong and they have very limited, over priced food options available which are limited to burgers or burgers or have I mentioned burgers! As a vegetarian and health conscious person this really has set me off on the wrong foot for our journey home.

We have a connecting flight to Las Vegas which I doubt we will actually make and there have been no apologies from staff in the slightest.

Horrendous customer service with no professionalism. I cant see any toilets and I am so thirsty its ridiculous. No refreshments. As I take over 33 pills a day for my illnesses I often need a drink as I get a dry mouth. No common courtesy given to anyone visiting this supposedly customer service friendly country. This isnt at all about safety, this is purely down to an incompetent management. My advice - sack them all and start again! Terrible start to the holiday, was planning on visiting NYC with my daughter this coming February but definitely rethinking this after our experience today. Never known anything like it! Ive attached photos of the queue (now 1hr 50 mins in) and the empty booths so you can see how inept staff are at making sure customers are dealt with swiftly and securely.

We had 2 little kids with us and every time we asked the security staff to let us cut the lines because we will miss our connecting flight. The answer was the same: we will make sure we get you to your gate on time. Well. Guess what happened? We missed our flight. We were stuck at this horrible airport for an additional 6 hours because appearently United Airlines closed their gates 10 minutes prior to departure even though theyre missing passengers and the security staff kept telling us to not pay any attention to the boarding time but the departure time is what we should aim for. Completely dumb and uninformed. At this point the gave us the boarding passes for our next flight which was on the other side of the airport. And we had to walk to the customer service to get those boarding passes which was at the other end of the terminal we were at. The worst thing was that the gate was changed one hour prior to boarding to a completely different terminal. We had to walk for another 25 minutes carrying our kids who at this point had not had any sleep in 30 hours and every time we asked an employee with a cart (people mover) to help take us to the gate, they kept coming up with some excuse to not take us by what seemed out of complete lazyness.

Logan Airport seems at first sight to be well organized for this - staff to direct you, electronic devices meant to speed up certain procedures, etc. However, there was a bottleneck situation the other day because 3 flights arrived at more or less the same time, and so it took all of 2 hours from the time I left the aircraft to the time I left the airport. This in and of itself is unacceptable, especially considering that it was mid afternoon and only about half of the posts were open. But even worse was the fact that many of the people in line with me were getting very nervous because they were afraid they would miss their connecting flights. However, when they asked if they could go through first, they were told it wasn't possible because everything had to be done on first come first served basis. The argument was that people who did not have connecting flights would protest and would never be served because in the meantime other flights would arrive. Not true because by the time I got through there were very few people still waiting in line. I for one would gladly let someone who is in a rush for a good reason go before me and I'm certain any sensible person would do the same. Other airports have staff available for the very purpose of directing people who have little time to catch their connecting flights. Why not Logan? It's a question of courtesy and common sense. And it's especially important here because for many foreigners this is their first experience on American soil! A fine welcome!!"

The customs officer kept arguing that all meat products outside the USA are forbidden from being brought into the country, even after a full explanation of the law of references for her to check, called me a liar and that any previous experiences I had of bringing these products into the country where done illegally, although every time the products were checked extensively by the previous customs officers and allowed into the country, the saucisson is now in a trash bin fault of having time to argue before my next flight.

If it werent for the competitive international fares Im able to acquire due to routing through this airport, Id never come. My plane landed at 4:30a, closing out an all-night flight of 11-1/2 hours. We were first to Passport Control, but other flights also arrived and discharged their passengers. There were hundreds in line, and only one agent was checking in the sea of American citizens returning home. Airport staff barked directions at incoming passengers, but with no clarity or organization or apparent purpose, generating even more confusion and frustration. My husband and I were near the front of the line; still, it was an hour before our passports were cleared. Exiting Control we followed signs for Connecting Flights. The main Connecting lobby was closed, so someone shouted from the top of the escalator to come upstairs. Once there we had the pleasure of joining all the Departing Passengers - both those Connecting (like us) and those just starting their trips. We stood in long Security lines, were yelled at by TSA staff or rudely ignored, and ultimately had three of our five parcels inspected/rifled. The airline staff has been courteous and helpful and genuinely concerned with passenger comfort and safety. The JFK airport staff, however, is the complete antithesis. How embarrassing for all of us, knowing that millions receive this sorry treatment. Get your act together, NY. Future passengers, be warned. Maybe your experience will be a good one.

By far the worst airport experience my wife or I have experienced on 'every' level. We are AA Frequent Flyers with Global Security status as well. LHR had the single most unnecessarily invasive, rude, redundant and down right nightmarish security checks & processing of any airport (International or domestic) we've ever encountered. And this was merely for a 'connecting' flight both times wherein we never left the secure area! In fact upon our initial arrival we were so delayed waiting to land then gate docking that we nearly missed connecting flight and were rushed with ""expedited pass"" by airport personnel with small group others yet we were 'still' run through the most rude, confusing and inhuman security checks ever experienced 'just' to get to our connecting flight gate! Really? Barely made our connecting flight and had no time to even use restroom in between all this rush and harassment. Our second Heathrow experience (returning home) was if you can believe it very much worse! Words are not enough to detail that experience and it still literally gives me nightmares and anxiety. The airport security is staffed almost exclusively by employees who almost all seemed to 'profile' travelers and ""run them through the ringer"" in the most rude, abrasive, disrespectful and insulting manner. I have no bias against any person as long they do their job properly and with respect for themselves, others and the institution they represent. The airport itself is horribly inefficient beginning with the bus transfers from arrival to departure gate areas, continuing with confusing signage or especially instructions, and finalized by some of the worst airport staff we've ever encountered in all our years flying. Again this was 'both' times we had to go through Heathrow and experienced by others around us as well, not an isolated incident. Heathrow is a disgrace to air travel & travelers and the fullest example of everything that is wrong today with airports in general. It is quite a shame that Heathrow is meant to be an International hub for so many travelers and thus such a gruelling experience for so many."

The staff are abrasive and constantly shouting unclear instructions at the top of their voices.

After making it through the customs checks, there were 6 other customs officers sitting around talking and laughing (twiddling their thumbs) Maybe they could have helped open up more lanes in customs? No - poor management. To add on top of all of this, the one line was full of Miami residents that did not need to make a connecting flight. Maybe they could have opened up a different line for solely connecting flights? No - poor management. After customs we then had to pick up our luggage at baggage claim and recheck our luggage!

After all of this was said and done all but one American line was open so our so called pre-check passes were useless After talking with a behind the counter representative from American, they would not reimburse us for a hotel or could they guarantee a seat in the next flight to Richmond. After staying the night in Miami on our expense, we arrived to our gate and American Airlines informed us only seat was available and that my wife could go ahead while I had to wait for another flight 10 hours later. But guess what? This was not a guaranteed seat either. Looks like Ill be staying in Miami until the I purchase my own set of tickets again.

We are almost 80 years old. We had been traveling 24 hours when we reached YVR. In all previous security checks on our journey we had been dealt with expeditiously with no problems. The service at security in Terminal C was an absolute disgrace. Firstly we were traveling Business Class but the first agent did not recognize Air New Zealand boarding passes and we were directed through the general lane. Secondly agent was exceptionally inefficient directing people to appropriate lines. He appeared completely disinterested and slowed down the whole process. Thirdly we were sent to line 7 for which the X ray scanner was taking about 3 minutes per item. Our time in processing was around 40 minutes. We were not the only people exceptionally frustrated. Others complained. Finally I asked who was the person in charge. He said his name but would not give his last name. He was with a group of agents who were just standing around talking and not making any efforts to speed the process. He should certainly not be running the operation if he cannot do things better. This experience at YVR was a disgrace to Canada. We have traveled extensively, including through LAX which is bad, but YVR should be avoided at all costs."

Fare enough. Instead of 3.5 hours we had about 1,5 hours, landing about 2 pm local time at HIA. We had 1 hour and a half to catch our flight to London scheduled for 16:25. Going through the whole process of passport checks, security checks and customs we realized that we have very limited time and started to worry. As we approached the last hurdle the baggage check we were told to go to a certain queue obviously for other people like us catching other flights. My friend was also doing it on the next line. I noticed they searched his bottles of Tequila that we both bought in Cancun. They were properly sealed and put back in the boxes and we were assured that this is ok to travell via Houston. I went to ask what is going on and asked kindly what is going on and that we are running late for our flight. One of the girls working as security replied to me -What is it got to do with me! At that point i thought that this was appalling to get answer like this but as we had very little time to get to the gate i decided not to get involved anymore. I few minutes later to my horror i realized that i have forgotten the bag with my two bottles. Immediately returned back and asked for it. An officer has given them back to me but they started checking them one by one the slowest possible way. In the meantime they confiscated on of the bottles from my mate although they wanted to take the other one as well. While i was waiting nervously for it to happen rep of United airlines looked at the screen and said my flight was now gone and i have no chance of getting on the plane. I desperately tried to call my wife who was at the gate but could not get through. Eventually a got my bottles and looked at the screen hoping for delay but there was nothing to confirm it. I had to run to gate E5 with my 13 old son and when we got finally there, there was a huge queue and people were still getting on board. Obviously the flight was delayed but nobody advised us on that and it was not shown on the screens. I cannot believe how unhelpful and rude were some of the people from security department and United Airlines. They kept repeating we are going to miss the flight and did not help us whatsoever. It was the opposite. They were rude and sarcastic."

When we realized we were not going to make it on time (boarding time had started since 30 minutes), we asked a tsa agent to help us to cut the line. We were suprised of her negative answer as its usually how we do it in Europe. We were even more surprised when she asked us to wait while everyone was passing in front us, making us even later for our flight, in the future, we hope there will be some changes regarding the organization of the tsa security queue to reduce its duration.

We arrived on a surprisingly sparsely populated flight from London, a ten hour flight on which we were able to lie across three seats each - we thought we were lucky! (In retrospect, it seems other travellers have, perhaps, learned the lesson from experiencing what we were were just about to endure - and they found alternative routes). Plodding the long route to Immigration brought us to a large hall where we were confronted with, probably, 20 modern, state-of-the-art, passport-reading, data-collection machines. It is apparent from 95% of all the passengers being directed to the snake-queue (with a cross on the machines print-outs) illustrate that these state-of-the-art machine were as much use as a chocolate tea pot! I estimate that there were 300 passengers in the queue (line) for immigration and only two of the immigration desks were open. 2 hours later we emerged from this inefficient, utterly farcical process, to rush on to Baggage Reclaim to retrieve our luggage for onward travel. All the carousels were stopped, little in the way of a clue which group of off-loaded bags might contain ours. 10 more minutes wasted. With just less than an hour left we rushed off to check-in our bags. Scanning the labels affixed in London we were then told that our flight to Pensacola (21:30) was delayed until the next morning. (This is not any definition of delay with which I have been previously aware: the flight was cancelled, cynically categorise as delayed, without any regard for the inconvenience to us, United Airlines customers, or for those who were travelling to meet us.) As with others reviews, finding a member of staff to provide any help, reassurance or information was nigh on impossible as we passed through to this point. The staff directing us just weret interested in our concerns at the speed of the queue/processing: indeed they said that we should complain to the immigration officer - see how we got on! We did: its all because of the reallocation of staff to the Mexican border, we were told. Seems to me that the technology employed to replace the immigration officers is unfit for purpose, the immigration management team are not fit for purpose. Please dont think that this inconvenient, inconsiderate, inept system is only foisted on aliens (from outside the US) there were US citizens with us in this queue as a result of the ineffective, technologically defective equipment. In conclusion, reviews on this website of the Houston Airports customers seem to indicate that our flight was only 30% populated because those in the know have found another airline/hub airport to use in preference to this shambolic shower. It is fair to point out that after queuing for another 40 minutes, we spent a further 40 minutes being processed - we were provided accommodation at the local Holiday Inn and food vouchers - and a flight ticket to continue our journey the next morning. Interestingly, our onward flight was completely full - accommodating passengers whos earlier flight had been cancelled. After this trip, we will not fly by United Airlines to George Bush Airport again. George Bush Airport management need to recognise and address these problems before they lose their rest of their passengers to others."

Also the first airport I have been asked to step out of one queue for security (with 30 or so others) and then walk about 500m to a completely different security spot downstairs as they were unable to cope with the numbers.

Talk about adding to what is an airport already at capacity and backed up with check in and security - I blame Spirit Airlines for that. Another thing - there is no decent lounges - this is an area where wealthy people travel through all the time for cruises and yacht trips.

There is no information desk airside, eventually had to accost some maintenance workers who kindly made some calls to direct me to the correct terminal. Why this was so hard is incompletely beyond comprehension. Note, I had checked in at the time if my first leg, so gate details were not on my boarding pass. Eventually got to the gate to find people flayed across the ground - for some reason the gate had no seats. By this stage the overwhelming incompetency became comical and I had a good laugh.

2019-05-19,2019-05-19,1.0,"""Newark is an embarrassment"""," |  Well, I can say at the least, Newark is an embarrassment. We arrived at terminal A, and had a connecting flight to Frankfurt, Germany. We had to navigate to terminal B, specifically gate B62. I looked up for the signage, directing me to the appropriate terminal. Terminal B was down a level, and by bus, the signs said we would be arriving. We took the elevator, as we had some carry-on luggage and the stairs looked, precarious. I could quite possibly be over-exaggerating, but we waited at this old elevator for what seemed like a solid 5 minutes, before the door opened. It was like a time warp, back to the 80's inside this elevator. We exited and saw a bus. As I approached the airport worker, I asked her if this bus went to terminal B. Very rudely, she asked me which gate. I told her gate B62. She said that this was not my bus, no bus goes to B62, and that I would have to go back up to terminal A, take a right, and another right and then I could get to terminal B. Confused because of the signs I just read, directing us to this bus, we turned around. Not wanting to wait for the slow elevator, we opted for the stairwell. The stairwell leading back to the terminal, was completely atrocious. Bird wire fencing for walls, trash, dirt and cigarette stench enveloped the narrow and steep stairs. I am not sure if they are even OSHA compliant. There was room for only one direction of travel up and down the stairs. A person walking down would have to stop, mash up against the bird wire fencing and wait for them to pass by. So we take a right and then another right, and we see a sign for terminal B and an arrow, but the ""B"" has been painted over, as if to signify that terminal B was not in the direction we were directed to go! We were basically leaving the airport, by following this rude airport workers' advice. I asked one of the security workers in that hallway if we could get to terminal B this way, and he rambled off on some rude tangent about can't I read the signs? Totally rude and un-helpful. Not wanting to miss our flight by leaving the terminal, we back tracked to the area we began from, in hopes to see another poorly illustrated sign. Luckily a flight attendant was sitting close by, and saw the look of confusion on our faces. She informed us that yes, we were supposed to leave the terminal, take the sky train to terminal B, gate B62. Off we went. When we got off the train, all I could see was a long line of passengers, waiting to get through security. Regrettably, we had to join that line. The line was formed with mis-matching, dated stanchions, crooked and not even wide enough to pull a carry-on through. In the back ground, all I could hear was security officers yelling and belittling passengers for having candy in their bags, over and over again. Publicly shaming these poor foreign passengers, in my country, which I love and have served and protected. I was so embarrassed. Is this how America treats people? First impression is the most important and this was a complete nightmare. Thank goodness my flight to Frankfurt was delayed, because I would not have made it home that day. We got through security and all the passengers at gate B62 were still standing in a long line, waiting to board. The entire airport was dark, dank, out dated and just rude. It was so refreshing to arrive (late) at Frankfurt, where there is order and cleanliness and polite people. Get your crap together, Newark. You are a shameful experience. Never again. Never."

Then moved to another line with even slower service. When the staff was asked why the mobile passport people had to go through the line. Nobody would answer the question and just say to stay right here. After getting through the line, I found another staff member and asked him the same question and he said ""just keep walking good bye"". So with no answer how am I suppose to know what to do next time. As an American citizen we are being led around by people that cant understand nor hold a conversation in English. We fly have flown American Airlines for a long time but things need to be corrected. I will be doing some comparisons with Southwest from now on.

It's an utter disgrace to put people through that type of wait time after traveling. There were two agents for that huge line. Even having four agents would have made a huge difference. 8 agents would have cut the wait down to just over what I had, which was plenty. After missing our flight, we spoke to a few different help desks. They were all lovely and helpful, but rather low on correct knowledge. One sent us to a travel agency pretty far away to book a new flight, and when we made it there, there was no staff. They also told us we could go to airline counters to book flights which was incorrect. The best advice the one guy gave me was to not book with cheap airlines because they provide bad/low customer service when things go awry! If you're going to fly through here be prepared for possible long customs waits, and read the info on your airlines website (for instance, that the check in desk closes an hour before the flight even though the gate is 10 minutes away!). I guess, basically, be prepared."

A guy behind us literally said they arent sure if theyre pre-checked and she never stopped to explain or check his pass or anything. she just hurried him along in line. Some people are first time flyers. Be patient, be helpful, do your job. help educate them so next time things can go smoother. Next  allow families/groups to stay together. When one attendant is pulling one-by-one from three different lines, the person or people I am traveling with could be very far behind me. This is not conducive with groups of minors. It can be scary and allowing them to stay together is a small courtesy that could be extended to help out. Teach your workers patience. It was terrible here. Back home our airport is respectful and understanding, this was a huge shock for my group and I. We will not be returning. Its about to be a long day and this experience has made it longer."

As a UK citizen entering from the US and transiting to Manchester, we arrived in T3 and had to wait about 10 minutes for an operator to attach the airbridge. Once attached, we had a lengthy walk (about 15 minutes) to get to the UK Border and immigration check. Signage was OK but limited. Having been scanned at the ePassport barrier, I thought I was through and into the terminal proper but I was immediately confronted with another bank of scanners and bar code readers - no explanation or instructions. There was an unhelpful and surly security guard who stopped me from walking around these scanners. He told me that I had to (again) remove my glasses and have my photo taken for ""airport security"" - why? I asked him when my data would be removed from Heathrow's system. He gave me the impression he had no idea why I was asking and then glibly agreed with me that it would be deleted when I left the airport. I dont believe it for a moment. Given the recent court case about facial recognition software, where is the policy statement from Heathrow about the usage of our data and how it is protected/deleted? Once through this barrier, another lengthy walk to a bus gate for a long transfer to T5. Why does Heathrow not have a skytrain connecting terminals? After our overnight flight, we were made to wait about 30 minutes until a bus arrived at which point, there was a massive queue of people. The driver of the bus was rude, just packing people into the bus and then driving at quite a speed around a maze of roads to get to T5. We were then confronted with another walk to security where we again went through the usual street theatre of security, overseen by an unsmiling security guard - welcome to the UK. Had I been a foreign visitor, I would not have had a good impression of the UK. Once through the chaos of security, the shopping mall which is T5 was crowded with very few seats available and throngs of confused looking people. Eventually, we got to our connecting gate where our pictures were taken again before we were allowed to board. This airport is horrendous.

While they have updated the terminals over the years customer service is poor to non-existent. Recently flew back from Barcelona on Sat. 5/25/19 (holiday weekend) and trying to get through US Customs was not only a nightmare but a national disgrace. At 3pm only two (2) yes that's right 2 were on duty to check through hundreds if not thousand of flyers entering the USA. A near riot nearly broke out due to the people having to wait over 2 hours for no other reason than poor staffing. The agents on duty were slow as sap in January (apparently they deal with this low staffing all the time) and have no sense of urgency in getting folks through customs. I was told this was normal staffing levels. As an American I gotten use to poor service in public transit but it does leave a sour taste with foreigners entering the US for the first.

I talked to 5 different people that were working at the airport and not a single one of them could help me. The lady for lost luggage area was super rude to me and told me she could not look after any of my bags so I could go look for my boyfriend.

I thought this was a tourist airport but not a single person could help me or understand me. No one would even let me use a phone they had. I think this is messed up on so many levels because I spent so much money to fly here and I got lost and not a single person could help me. Imagine a child getting lost and people just ignoring him or her because they speak english only and dont understand them, leaving them to fend for themselves,Its sad and a very scary thing, I am now afraid to go back to San Juan airport because of my experience and it needs to be heard and something needs to be done about it."

We flew out of Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport yesterday morning. We had a 6:50 am flight and arrived to return our rental car at 5:20. When we entered Terminal 1 we were shocked to see the security lines running both directions down the center of the terminal. One line had even doubled back on itself. I have never seen such long lines at any airport! (I hope it was due to bad weather the past few days and the need to reschedule people who missed flights but the security line would have taken at least 1 1/2 hours to get through) My husband and I have pre-check but my elderly parents ( early to late 80's) did not so he went through to our gate to make sure he could catch the flight for work while I stayed in the security line to help them. The line was moving very slowly and I became concerned that we might be in the wrong line. I asked a security officer near me if indeed I was headed in the right direction and expressed my concern that we would miss our flight. He said I was in the correct line and asked if I possibly had pre-check. I explained that I did but my parents didn't and that I needed to stay to help them through security and on the flight. He kindly had us follow him to another line where we were able to get through security as our flight was continuing the boarding process. We were able to grab a courtesy cart, as our gate was a long walk from the security checkpoint. We arrived at our gate just as boarding was finishing. I am so grateful for the help."

Be prepared for any and all necessary and unnecessary delays by incompetent workers, who sit around speaking to each other in their own mother-languages and don't stop their personal conversations to assist travelers.  Yesterday's flights were Seattle to YYC, connecting through YVR. We had to disembark, follow poor signage to pick up luggage, that I thought had been checked all the way through, but turns out was only ticketed all the way through. So, go to baggage claim, pick up luggage, go back to West Jet, check back in, wait for employees to stop chatting so they could override the kiosk check-in system, which would not accept my pre-ticketed suitcase. Check in suitcase, get new boarding passes, go through security. Security was an absolute nightmare.  Get shuffled into the new, and poorly designed, cattle type belt, with one person per one narrow space. As I pull my purse strap off my 25 yo diamond earring that my husband gave me for our wedding (and is the ONLY earring I have ever worn) goes flying off my right ear, and I'm being bumped from both left and right sides, and it literally becomes a brutal race by all security passengers to force their own plastic bin onto the belt first. But I suffered a TBI (traumatic brain injury) and don't have the balance and stability to keep bending down to retrieve a plastic bin and stand straight back up, without assistance. As I do this 4 times, to accommodate their separation rules, I notice my son accidentally left a pack of smoked salmon we purchased in Seattle, so I reach over to pick it up and lose my balance. He's 20 yo and has no excuse, accept to say that everyone is so harried, no one can peacefully load up their bins. Next I attempt to walk through the security scanner, and have to give that 3 tries: 1 to remove a bracelet,1 to remove a fabric belt with metal buckle, 1 to remove my runners. When I attempt to ask for assistance to locate my earring lost in the shuffle, I notice behind 2 security guards, that my entire suitcase is opened on a metal table in front of someone else! I darted over to that table to ask what was gong on? Only to be told I couldn't travel with that many cosmetics. What really embarrassed me was that the inept guard also removed a clearly marked bag of medications, for the entire line behind me now forming to see.There's absolutely no privacy and no respect for privacy. I am utterly embarrassed, with no shoes, no belt, no purse, I'm sorting through the mess this guard just made to cram my travel size toiletries into the prescribed plastic bag.  I was unnerved to say the least. I ask where the rest of my belongings are, and he says he doesn't know. I ask for a manager at this point, who takes several minutes to appear and am literally told to my face that this is how it's being done 'today.' The guard also broke the zipper on my Coach purse trying to zip it close."

2019-06-06,2019-06-06,1.0,"""inconvenience and mismanagement""","  | My experience at La Guardia was beyond the most horrific I have ever experienced in an impoverished third world country. I have been through airport construction projects in numerous airports and none remotely approached the inconvenience and mismanagement at La Guardia. None, nowhere. Communication was nonexistent or worse, incomprehensible. I will select a few examples from this nightmare just to illustrate. We landed hours late because of weather (to be fair, no fault of the airport). It was almost midnight. We followed the taxi signs, followed the taxi signs, followed the taxi signs until, finally, at the end of the terminal, far from the usual curbside, we at last found the taxi stand. Or so we thought. The long line waiting for taxi was actually not waiting for taxis at all, but for the bus, to take us to the taxis. Taxis were not allowed at the terminal. So we waited in torrential rain for the bus, which eventually took us to another place where we waited in the rain for a taxi. For our return, I had rented a car and had to drop it off. Unlike any other airport, there were no signs directing you to the rental car return. Fortunately or so I thought I knew my way around. I headed through a maze of construction to the place car dropoffs had been for decades . All but 2 had to move because of the construction. There were no signs or any communications informing you where to go. I asked a police officer, who kindly sent me in the wrong direction. GPS didnt work. Finally, we found the virtually unmarked dropoff. I asked why there were no signs anywhere directing people to the new dropoffs. He responded, incredibly, that we are not allowed to have signs off the airport. We waited for the shuttle bus only to find out that the shuttle bus had to take us to another shuttle bus. During construction, car rental companies, who could not have signs off the airport, were not allowed to have shuttles on the airport. I know construction creates inconvenience, but the experience was a horrific nightmare not an inconvenience and I place full 100% blame on management, customer disregard, and complete incompetence in planning. As the saying goes, only in NY. "

I repeated myself several times and he just kept on looking at me and shooing me away. This is extremely unprofessional as I am a manager myself.

When I arrived to the check point, I informed another member that wasnt part of TSA, she had gave me the same inappropriate manner. She said I cant do anything, stay in line.

I headed for Passport Control and was told to stop and wait in a corridor to the Passport area. I waited and waited for 90 minutes along with several other people, most of whom complained to the staff on duty within an hour. Announcements came over the intercomms that the passport control area was very full and they were trying their best to clear the backlog. The area where we were queueing was a corridor less than four metres wide, with at least 50 to sixty other people off the same flight. This area was very hot and became unsafe, so much so that we were offered free water whilst we waited. Several other planes and putting it bluntly we were discriminated against. Although we had the necessary ESTA documentation to enter the States we along with many other passengers had to endure watching passengers rush right past us and enter the passport area to be processed whilst we had to wait in line. Many of those waiting missed onward flights thanks to this policy. After 90 minutes (roughly) we were allowed into the processing area. 30 plus finger printing machines were there for us to use. So after a nine-hour flight, ninety minutes waiting in a very hot area we were given the task of taking our own fingerprints. Now I understand English perfectly and read the instructions perfectly, but would the machine take my prints - no. I then checked the screen below where my fingers had been, it was dirty, greasy and covered in what I assumed was sweat. I pointed this out to an attendant. There were just two helpers at the time trying to control this area and barking at the passengers. Two helpers for 30 dirty fingerprinting plates and people from all over the world not understanding the instructions walking around puzzled, bewildered and disenchanted. So wondering what germs or microbiological virus I would pick up from this experience I transferred to a different machine. Eventually, I obtained a piece of paper with a large X across it. I had failed my first test to get into the USA, now I was being barked at again being ordered to another queue about two and a half hours after my landing in the United States. After three hours I was given the all clear by a United States Customs Officer in a little booth, with his own fingerprinting machine that eventually, although just as unclean as the previous one agreed to read my fingertips! This was a very bad experience. Despite many complaints by my fellow passengers, many of whom were fellow Brits, we were discriminated against. The young customs officer who eventually allowed us into the United States stated: We are getting new machinery soon. This experience which I can prove beyond doubt will mean I will never travel through Seattle again. I found the people nasty, barking at us, talking to us like we were thick and shepherding us around like sheep. I assume that anybody who lives in Seattle or works there would also be disgusted if they saw how people visiting their city for the first time ever were treated."
2019-06-16,2019-06-16,2.0,"""needs to be some management improvement"""," |  There are so many problems with every aspect of this airport. I'm going to list problems with some no-cost or low-cost solutions. 1) Concourses are narrow, so pedestrian traffic is a mess. People are constantly bumping, almost bumping, crossing in front of, and getting behind slow people. Last night, a member of the cleaning crew had parked a rolling garbage bin in the middle of the concourse (E) and was off to the side having a casual conversation with a vendor. This caused many pedestrian issues, in an already stressful environment. Solution: train cleaning crews about traffic in the concourses and how to treat customers better and NOT block their paths. 2) Continual gate change for arrivals, and - what seems like - confusion for the airplane waiting to pull into the appropriate gate. I don't know how much larger airports are so organized, but CLT needs to have systems in place for parking planes quickly at their gates to get people to their connecting flights on time. Last night in Concourse E Gate 17 (6/13/2019), 5 breathless passengers showed up to catch the last flight to Columbia SC that day. The unconcerned gate employee told them the doors were closed, and there was nothing he could do. Their incoming flight had been blocked from their gate for a time, making them late to the Columbia flight and that flight pulled away without them. super simple, cheap solution: have a gate ready for each arriving plane. If a plane has passengers for connections, communicate with their connecting plane's crew to please wait 3-5 minutes for the passengers to arrive. 3) Some of the slide-walks weren't working, and you need that extra boost in speed to reach long distances between connections (see above). Solutions: maintain existing equipment and keep it running. 4) Lots of trash, lots of people working who seemed to not want to be there, and boarding queues crowding the already narrow corridors - there needs to be some management improvement at this airport.

The people who were supposed to be helping were pushy and short as if we were inconveniencing them and not the other way around and several people missed their flights because of their mess. Tsa workers were continually shuffling which security areas were open which made the wait longer (a couple who arrived 30 minutes before me made it to the same gate at the same time because they had gates closed just as they were about to enter security twice).

2019-06-17,2019-06-17,1.0,"""a very bad experience"""," |  I entered Seattle on a Virgin flight on Thursday 30th May. I headed for Passport Control and was told to stop and wait in a corridor to the Passport area. I waited and waited for 90 minutes along with several other people , most of whom complained to the staff on duty after an hour. Announcements came over the intercomms that the passport control area was very full and they were trying their best to clear the backlog. The area where we were queueing was a corridor less than four metres wide , with at least 50 to sixty other people off the same flight. This area was very hot and became unsafe, so much so that we were offered free water whilst we waited. Several other planes arrived and putting it bluntly we were discriminated against. Although we had the necessary ESTA documentation to enter the States we along with many other passengers had to endure watching passengers rush right past us and enter the passport area to be processed whilst we had to wait in line. Many of those waiting missed onward flights thanks to this policy. After 90 minutes (roughly) we were allowed into the processing area. 30 plus finger printing machines were there for us to use. So after a nine hour flight and ninety minutes waiting in a very hot area we were given the task of taking our own finger prints . Now I understand English perfectly and read the instructions perfectly, but would the machine take my prints ? .NO. I then checked the screen below where my fingers had been, the finger plate was dirty , greasy and covered in what I assumed was sweat. I pointed this out to an attendant. There were just two helpers at the time trying to control this area and barking at the passengers. Two helpers for 30 dirty fingerprinting plates and people from all over the world not understanding the instructions walking around puzzled, bewildered and disenchanted . So wondering what germs or micro biological virus I would pick up from this experience I transferred to a different machine. Eventually I obtained a piece of paper with a large X across it. I had failed my first test to get into the USA, now I was being barked at again and being ordered to another queue about two and half hours after my landing in the United States. After three hours I was given the all clear by a United States Customs Officer in a little booth, with his own finger printing machine that eventually, (although just as unclean as the previous one) agreed to read my finger tips ! This was a very bad experience. Despite many complaints by my fellow passengers, many of whom were fellow Brits, we all felt we were discriminated against. The young customs officer who eventually allowed us in to the United States stated We are getting new machinery soon. This experience which I can prove beyond doubt will mean I will never travel through Seattle again. I found the people nasty, barking at us, talking to us like we were thick and shepherding us around like sheep. I assume that anybody who lives in Seattle or works there would also be disgusted if they saw how people visiting their city for the first time ever were treated."

We came in on a 10.5 hour international flight and were trapped between customs and security points waiting on luggage. Very little seating. 150+ passengers. The airport personnel were not unloading luggage so we sat for over an hour. We were told not to worry about connecting flights, since the airport was shut down. Well luggage came and we heard the boarding call for our connection. We dashed to the security point. We had pre-TSA tickets but there was no pre-TSA line. TSA personnel just shrugged and told us we had to get in line. We made it through and heard our final boarding call. Our carry-ons went thru the scanner, were sitting in sight but we could not reach them. We very politely asked 2 different TSA staff just to please push our carry-ons about 3 feet where we could grab them - both shook their heads ""no"" and would not help us. So, when we could reach our stuff, we grabbed it and ran like the wind. I didn't even get my shoes on. Had to race 10 gates to get to our flight. Mind you, we are 60-something old and running through the airport is not something we need to be doing. Glad we still do some jogging or we would not have made it. We have a profoundly disabled son at home and we needed to get home to relieve our staff before the shift ended. We made it home by the skin of our teeth! We had given ourselves 5 extra hours just in case. Very stressful experience. I hope passengers from other countries don't think this is the way Americans are."

Instead, there are very few staff around to help and direct (and the ones that are just blindly tell you to go to the next checkpoint because its quicker, when its not). The TSA agents are rude and defensive. One was giving me a dirty look and she said because I had given her one. Well, yes, I just waited in a 1.5 hour line for no reason, did she? She then went on that its my fault I was late (when I arrived almost 2 hours before my domestic flight). They also flag and pull lots of luggage from the linebut then theres no one to check that flagged luggage and you have to wait another 10 minutes while your bags just sit there.

Between the bare-bones number of TSA screeners on shift and being selected for additional screening/pat down, I missed my connecting flight by two minutes. The airport workers made it very clear through their half-mumbled non-responses that they did not give even care about trying to help me identify who I should speak to regarding the situation.

We were supposed to travel by Swift Air, a small charter company. Atlanta Airport is huge and all of us were at the airport international terminal 3.5 hours before our flight. We have looked around for Swift Air signs but did not see any, so we asked 3 different airport customer service representatives, showed them our travel documents, and all of them told us that we have to go to the Domestic terminal, even though it was an international flight. We also stopped by the information desk at the international terminal, showed our paperwork, the customer service representative checked something on her computer and also advised us to go to the domestic terminal. It takes at least 20 min to get to the Domestic terminal plus the waiting time for the shuttle. Once we got there and run around through the whole terminal, asked several staff members, who had no idea where Swift Air was, we finally got to one of the TSA members who used his radio to find out that Swift is at the International terminal. After we spend $50 on the taxi for 20 min drive, since we were running out of time, we got back to where we started. We ran through the whole terminal and finally found Swift Air counters all the way in the back of the terminal with no signs in the whole airport to guide people where to go, except for the signs on top of the counter. Also, all of the international terminal staff members had no clue where Swift Air counters were! We got to the counter 45 minutes before the flight, but we were denied boarding, as well as another family of 5, who went through the same ordeal. I do not understand why airport employees are incompetent and not knowledgeable. No one knows which airline is located at what terminal. Due to all of this, we had to purchase new tickets from Birmingham, AL with a connection back in Atlanta, for the next morning. We had to rent 2 cars, drive 3 hours to AL, fly back to Atlanta to finally board to Punta Cana, all due to the incompetency of staff working at the airport.

Waited in line for 1.5 hrs. Then after finally getting through this horror, no directions to connecting flights, hardly any tv screens for departure gate times, they dont tell you the terminal attached to the gate, so we wound up walking to gate B51, which was endless from customs.

There is a totally inadequate pet relief area with a small bit of gravel, no grass. For smokers one goes outside the terminal at the baggage claim area, it is filthy and there is no cover which must be awful in the winter when it rains a lot in Seattle. To reach shuttle buses, Uber and other transportation you have to take an elevator or escalator up another level, cross a skybridge and then take another elevator down again.

At night the airport decides to run the trains on a significantly reduced schedule regardless of how many passengers are waiting for it. Ive seen 20 minutes between trains, with the waiting area so packed that only half of the people can board the 1st train, so they have to wait another 20 minutes. The folks in charge of the measily savings this provides should be immediately terminated for their complete disregard for customer service."

They kept letting all the flight crews go in front (understandable, but why not hold up the 'slow' line instead) and had only two lines open. There were no bins anywhere. If you had keys or a phone in your pocket, you were completely out of luck. My husband had a sweater they made him take off, but it got caught on the conveyor and damaged. Who has run into a baggage scanner which has no bins in use anywhere? If you have a big carry-on, you can put stuff inside - but then that, depending on your bag, means opening up your whole bag on the conveyor belt while they are yelling at you to move it along. I have knee replacements and told them, they sent me through the regular line which beeped of course, then made me go back through the body scanner line, holding others up, and then they had to do a manual search anyway. It was a disorganized mess - the worst security screening we've seen in the past year with about 60 flights in at least 24 airports. Shame on you, SFO!"

An extremely long level flight at minimum altitude followed before we reached the glidepath. Taxiing to the terminal was delayed again due to ""traffic"" - we stood on the taxiway for aeons with engines running. Entering the arrival concourse we found a long walk to the end of a huge crowd of arriving passengers queueing for so-called immigration. Coming from an efficient home airport we were overwhelmed. Even families with small children had to stand. If you had to go to the bathroom - forget it. We arrived at a few self-check machines where we had to type in lots of info plus give fingerprints and face photo. A slip was issued and we were so naive to think that was it - like at other airports in the world, and only customs would follow. No way. There was another queue (sort of like what cattle go thru at the slaughterhouse), even slower. When we were at the front, to our surprise, we got to an unfriendly (we had know they are from many previous US visits) inspector who did not bother to speak loud and clear. He wanted all the info the machine had asked just before, plus fingerprints, this time including the thumbs. We had the impression foreign tourists are a burden in this country. The baggage had long been removed from the delivery belt and put aside. The whole procedure took 100 minutes from aircraft door to baggage claim. The signage that should lead us to the TSA checkpoint was poor. TSA - long lines, we got to the front a bit faster as we were business class. The whole checkpoint was a complete zoo. Due to the new full body scan you had to remove the complete contents of your pockets, handkie, notepaper everything. Then the train ride - more or less swift. The departure gate was not friendly and inviting, not enough seating and poor shops. The airline refused to let us wait in the first class lounge as we were not members. Thanks goodness here in Europe you can use the lounges if you go business."

There are numerous signs telling you how long it will take to walk to your gate, also the wifi is great. Some things could be improved: Like many airports you need to walk through the duty free shop to get to the main seating area - The water / bottle refill stations are hidden near the toilets - The outside area is a little confusing as it is on multiple levels and could do with better signage, lower level for pick up and generally upper for drop off.

There were few staff to help and signage showed that this was a regular occurrence. The whole place was scruffy, chaotic and a truly shameful introduction to a great nation. All Americans should be outraged that the management of this atrocious facility are providing a shockingly bad first impression of their nation. I have travelled extensively throughout Europe, Asia and Africa and can truly say this was my worst ever introduction to a country that really couldn't care less about the impression it gives to visitors."

Got in at 11.00pm after a 9 hour flight and had to get another 5 hour flight 5 hours later, so we needed a place to sit and relax. The seating is very limited. Most airports provide rows of seats, however this airport has replaced the normal seating with large tables with limited seating that is somehow meant for ipad surfing at the tables and there seems to be a charge for this. The few row of seats that still exist are divided by metal arm rests which prevent the overnight waiting folks from stretching out, and definitely prevents mothers from holding babies and children, a very family unfriendly airport. It simply does not accomodate families at all. The alarm at the gate door keeps going off. It has been going for over an hour. What good is an alarm if the staff does not come and investigate. Customs requires a checkin at a kiosk. We tried four kiosks, and none if them actually worked. One man was helping people, and he was nice enough, but he couldn't get them to work either. He said the internet connection was slow and they have problems with this all the time. Really? Fix this! We finally managed to get the 5th kiosk to work, but it took us about 20 minutes. Then there was the line for the agent. Then there was the line for the luggage. Then it spit us back out into the unsecured area and we had to go back through TSA. The food look awful and was horribly overpriced. We waited to purchase something on the plane. We weren't about to buy poor quality overpriced food at this airport. Bathrooms were filthy. The tables with the ipads are filthy underneath. The chairs are bolted to the floor so apparently they can't get in there to clean. The way the seating was arranged is not family friendly.

An immigration officer yelled at us because we were supposed to wait our turn. We didnt realize we had crossed a line. Then he threatened to make us miss our flight when we simply stated there was no signage telling us to wait. My father is in a wheelchair and instead of assisting us, he called at least 15 pax from another line. He didnt just hold us up but the flight crew in line behind us. Total jerk with a badge, shame on you, Canada Customs! What we did see was a lot of employees standing around, talking or doing absolutely nothing.

Unlike in London Heathrow, no passport check before arriving at the gate, so make sure to call in at the check in even if you have already done it and you don't have any checked baggage to drop off, otherwise you will be called at the gate for passport check.

It took 3 hours just to have my passport checked! It took 30 minutes at Montego Bay in Jamaica. I spoke to a couple, who missed their connecting flight by 5 minutes, due to the unacceptable time waiting in this queue and as a result, lost 1 day of their holiday, Fort Worth Texas, was quicker but still took over an hour. When I asked if there was anyway of speeding up the process, as it was quite likely that I would miss my connecting flight back to the UK, the airport staff just stated that there was nothing to be done in order to speed the process up.

It was like an oven in the terminal and there was one dingy old fan for ten gates. Also the carpet was dirty and there weren't enough seats.

On return around 22.45 the finger took a long time being deployed and then suitcases took ages to arrive. Big pause of around 15 minutes between first and second batch of bags coming through.

We got to the airport with plenty of time to spare because I knew from previous experience how long and time consuming security can be there. The first thing we did was stop at the rest room right by security. The people in front of us in line informed me there wasn't any toilet paper in the stalls. I was hoping they were misinformed but they were correct. There was no toilet paper. There was a woman with a TSA vest on in the restroom. Someone in the restroom asked her if she could let someone know there wasn't any toilet paper and she blankly looked at her and walked away. I was very surprised to see the security line wasn't very long! My 18 month old son has special needs. He has a feeding pump and has Cerebral Palsy therefore he is unable to stand or sit on his own. The TSA agent wanted our stroller to go through the conveyor belt machine. I told the agent I'd rather push it through so I would have someplace to set down my son while I gathered our things after they came through the belt. (I knew I'd have to hold my son but wanted to be able to set him down afterwards) She said no. She then took off all 3 of the stroller wheels and crammed it down so it fit through the machine. My son and I walked through where we were supposed to be and waited for our things. I had a backpack, laptop, my sons diaper bag, my sons feeding pump, my shoes, my keys, my phone, and my stroller without wheels to get after it went through the conveyor belt. So I'm standing there holding my son, who I can't set down anywhere wondering how I'm going to get all of this stuff back where it needs to be. Eventually I asked one of the TSA agents if they were going to put my stroller back together. I got a blank look and he went back to what he was doing. I then loudly said ""Someone better get over here and put my stroller back together"" and an agent put my stroller back together so I could set my son down and get all of our stuff. The staff I encountered during my time at Denver airport were not helpful. I originally flew from Minneapolis to Denver a week earlier and had zero trouble going through security. The staff at MSP was all very helpful and understanding. They let me push my stroller through so I could have someplace to set my son down. They helped me gather my things.

The guys driving the shuttle buses to and from the rental car location are absolutely idiotic and do nothing but pander for tips. Hint - you can walk faster to your terminal than taking one these buses. The terminals are small, crowded with virtually no shopping and horrible restaurants. The security is a total joke - they make up the rules as I go along and act like Nazi's. I had one idiot tell me that I was wearing the wrong type of underwear for Florida. I am not so sure he just didn't want to pat down my crotch. My wife's purse went missing and security ended up doing an ""inspection"" of it. Our travel cash was in it and we aren't so sure that the guard wasn't trying to take some of it. The restaurants inside the gate are horrible with terrible service and food. This whole place is the lowest of the low. If you need to travel to the area do yourself a favour and go to the Miami Airport it is 100 times better than this monstrosity."

Read other reviews I use the Nexus/Trusted traveler option so no delays here - about as quick as going through normal EU Immigration at LHR: which highlights the 'pain' that tourists feel at YVR. But, all that time saving at Immigration is for nothing since the baggage handling is so poor, and why it is not reported as such in other reviews. It is almost like the baggage handling is designed to make the Immigration department look good - ""my bag just gets to the carousel when I finally make it through Immigration"". Outbound, Pleasant surroundings but YVR is expensive to purchase anything (more so than LHR, FRA, AMS for example). For locals this is a real slap in the face since one of the specific promises made by the Government and the YVR Management Company to the citizens who (through the Crown) own the airport would be that they would have pricing comparable to downtown locations. Services provided are ok in extent, but too often the server cannot speak English, which is hard to swallow for a country with English as its official language and located in British columbia.

The ground agents/staff working in the Atlanta airport are rude. When checking my bag in, the rep looked at me as if I was bothering her. She never greeted me with hello or a smile. I was clearly confused as the Atlanta airport is 5x the size of my hometown airport and even said out loud, I dont know where to go. She just ignored me and looked away. I eventually figured it out but it wouldve been extremely helpful if she just pointed or simply said that way. Im sorry but if Im paying Delta over 1k to fly Id at least like to receive decent customer service. I think Delta should invest in customer service training. This was my first experience flying with Delta and my last."

I have traveled to most states, and all the airports have their quirks, but this one annoyed me and that is hard to do when I am on vacation. I am not going to complain about things they have no control over like TSA lines or airline queues though their queue lines for taking passengers to the Rental Car Station was 100 yards long. I am going to complain about an unsafe practice that is directly caused by airport management. The use of buses to take passengers to their planes is something I have seen before and understand. However, filling the buses with passengers like sardines with carry on luggage is a recipe for disaster. I complained to the workers and they kept pushing people in. As I expected, the bus had to come to a hard stop (normally I would not have considered the stop as bad), and everyone wound up bumping into each other and tripping over luggage. No one was hurt but this is an accident waiting to happen. They had four buses queued up and it was unnecessary to unsafely pack this many people just because they think this is a subway car or a street bus. I choose to be on those and subject myself to that when necessary but not at an airport with carry on luggage. The other disappointing feature of the airport is its dinginess. The outside areas where you wait are poorly maintained with debris all over along with dirty walls and sidewalks. Not what I have come to expect from a US airport. I know its next to impossible to choose your airport but stay away from this one if you can until they make things safer and clean up their public areas."

The reason for this is the rudeness and total ineptness of  staff you come across. It seems that to wear a uniform at JFK airport turns that person in to someone who thinks they are head of the Military or Police. Let me tell you something, you can still be nice to people. YOU have to travel sometimes, does the experience of coming across someone with your attitude make you happy? Of course it doesn't. On Monday evening, all us travellers waiting to have our bags scanned were herded in to an area and made to wait. Huge unnecessary queues. How many x-ray scanners were available? Two. And they would let 4 or 5 people through at a time to the underworked customs staff. And not a smile anywhere. Thankfully I had Priority boarding which meant I could get through relatively quickly (about half an hour). I didn't bother with the priority boarding at the actual gate as the staff were clearly uninterested in this. If I ever have the misfortune of going through JFK again, I will make sure to be there at least 4 hours before the plane leaves. Coming through was relatively easy thanks to the ESTA process but getting shouted at by certain staff was amusing. Again, something to tell you: we love coming to visit but have no intention of wanting to stay in your lovely country illegally. Really, I like where I live. So, Florida next year. I am assuming they are still happy staff down there because, well, it's Florida. JFK staff could learn a lot from other countries where people love their jobs.The UK, Spain, France, Netherlands, Czech, Germany, South America, Australia, the list is endless."

For an airport of this size it is woefully lacking in outlets to charge your phones etc. Gates had 1 receptacle and few and far between walking around to find one. When you have a four hour layover (which extended to 5.5) you definitely need access to charge. Most annoying issue was changing of gates, we had been warned in Vancouver that this occurred but the true hassle needs to be experienced. On our flight to Dublin, not only was craft delayed 1.5 hours but we changed gates, this consisted of a 20 minute walk, difficult with a 75 year old carrying carry-on baggage and purse. On our return flight another 4 hour layover jockeying for plug-in space, yet another gate change, gathered our sleep deprived bodies, carryons, duty free purchases and tromped with the mob to our new gate, I actually woke a poor gentleman as he had not heard the overhead, this trek was about 10 minute, but felt longer due to an already 12 hour day, only to hear the overhead, just as we arrived at the gate, tell us to return to the original gate. Much grumbling and frustration amongst all, especially all the over 65s. Shuttle cars zipped by us repeatedly, empty with driver only and seemingly no interest in assisting people with transport. Seriously worst airport experience."

On the way to Manchester I had the unfortunate opportunity to experience this horrendous, unorganized airport. The positive note, I didn't need to go to a gym to get a good workout. Speed walking through the many, mile long corridors was stressful and discouraging. All I wanted was to get a bite to eat and have a drink, and find my gate. There was a few gate changes and every time it sent me into a panicking game of hide and seek. The gates are not always clear from the signs and are hidden behind stores and the food court. The lounge was cramped and crowded, hard to maneuver around people's feet. On the way back to Winnipeg, we were herded around to line after line, and did the miles of walking. I was extremely tired to the point I could've collapsed on the floor, and very dehydrated from the flight. It felt like the herding around wouldn't end. This was also the first time I got to talk to a security agent who could see I wasn't alright but she said that it's allowable to sleep in the lounge. We were herded onto a bus, then shuttled to the next terminal, then I had to go back upstairs. The corridor was vast and when I found the lounge I thought closest to my gate I found the seats are designed to prevent people laying down on them. I tried to find a way around that but I got uncomfortable and moved to the low, metal window sill. I was desperate to sleep. I thought airports provided something for passengers on several hour layovers to kick back and have a rest. I got up with ample time before my flight and found my gate was elsewhere. It was actually in an area under renovations. Literally, people were still there at night working on the renovations with the hammering and drilling and the beeping of machines backing up. The washrooms are not as nice as Winnipeg's Richardson airport. Maybe it's an airport size issue with me. It was my first international flight. But seeing other reviews this doesn't seem the norm."

This brings you to terminal 1, where exhausted and hungry travellers are met with only fast food options with food courts, no sit down restaurants with a full kitchen. Ok, there is a sit-down hot dog restaurant, and a sit-down sandwich counter, these do not count. Even the pizza is by the slice and warmed up.

Over an hour for the luggage to make it from the plane to the baggage rotisserie. Then a chaotic and poorly designed means to re-deliver baggage for a connecting flight. There were a good number of plugs and outlets to recharge a laptop of phone. That is literally the only redeeming thing I can say about my four hour misery in this airport. Avoid at all costs.

Perhaps CBSA could consider placing the visitors that haven't learned the official language, lack communication resources, and/or are ill-prepared/disorganized in a separate queue?

When everyone finally left and we came to check out the agent was so rude to me and told me to complain to his boss who was by the way a nice gentleman and when i explained to him that we live in States and my two kids and I have passports and my husband has his Bosnian passport and a green card he then asked if we have shown the Delta agent his green card. I said we didnt because we were never asked for it. He then said that Delta agent shouldve sent us to the faster line because my husband had sufficient docs. He aldo said that I can complain to Delta supervisor at the front with the red suit on. I saw the lady and when asked if shes a delta supervisor and she said yes I explained what had happened and why Im upset. She very calmly said sorry but that her agents are fully trained. It wad pretty clear to me then that she wasnt interested in my story or that she cared, let alone admit the fault. This was by far the most humiliating and disappointing traveling experience ever!!!"

2019-07-30,2019-07-30,4.0,"""terminal to terminal is a hassle""","  |  I arrived at JFK from Manila on a Philippine Airlines flight in May 2019, used it for both arrival and departure on JetBlue in June 2019, and then used it for transit from a JetBlue flight to a Philippine Airlines flight in July 2019. Sure, you can get to this airport from seemingly anywhere around the world, and it services the exciting city of New York. The TSA agents typically are surprisingly decent too. And check-in staff are usually pretty nice. Unfortunately, that's pretty much the extent of the positives about this airport. Upon arrival in Terminal 1, I was greeted by a customs and immigration facility that appeared to be under construction. It looked awful - all torn up! A passport control officer was basically just waving all of us in the U.S. Citizens line through while wishing us a good one. It seemed to take a really long time for luggage to arrive on the carousel. I don't mean my luggage personally. I mean anyone's luggage! Meanwhile, staff informed my parents (who were picking me up there) that everyone from our flight had already exited customs - when none of us had yet! My first flight into JFK on JetBlue was delayed. My flight out of JFK on JetBlue was delayed. My flight back to JFK on JetBlue was delayed. I think the only reason my flight back to Manila on Philippine Airlines was NOT delayed was that it took off at 3:45 A.M., when no one else was flying out of the airport! Transiting from terminal to terminal is a hassle, too. It requires exiting your first terminal, walking down a seemingly endless hallway to the AirTrain, taking the AirTrain to your second terminal's stop, and then walking down another seemingly endless hallway to that terminal proper. Then, of course, because you're coming in from outside the secure area, you have to go through security all over again! As for food and beverage outlets, most appear to range from relatively expensive to borderline price gouging. One very notable exception was the Dunkin' Donuts landside in Terminal 1. It appears to be the only dining option available 24 hours, and so it was the only place I could use my $20 meal voucher landside, since my flight departed in the middle of the night. At Dunkin' Donuts, I was informed that if I was going to use my meal voucher, then I had to spend at least $20. I was astonished! I struggled to manage to buy $20 worth of food and drink there. I made myself sick. I still do not understand why they would not accept the voucher for a smaller amount. It's not like they would be losing money on the deal! Add to all of this restrooms which are often not very clean and with sensors which automatically turn on sink faucets when you're nowhere near them (but don't turn on when you are near them). Finally, there's the issue of the airport's being quite far from Manhattan. I've heard LaGuardia and Newark are even worse. If so, then heaven help the people who fly out of there!"

On the other hand, on return to the airport to Heathrow, security staff were laughing and joking with children and passengers and shouting out which computer games were the best which seemed to me inappropriate for such an important role.

We tried calling American Airlines representatives who told us just to speak with an attendant in person. Just recently we were told to go collect our luggage near baggage claim. Currently, two of our family members are waiting to receive our luggage from a woman who said There are only 5 employees pulling bags out, the other 50-100 have already clocked out and gone home.

Any time I questioned staff, they were confrontational and hostile towards me. When my wife finally got a pat down the employee verbally demeaned her, chastised her for not following directions, even though directions were not given.

I was traveling with my wife who is 73 years old. Both of us have mobility issues and therefore we had tickets that allowed us to avail wheelchair facility at the airport. (I was traveling from Mumbai in July.) To my utter disappointment, the airport does not have enough wheelchairs. We were made to wait for a significantly long time to get one, when we needed two. I made it known to the airport official that we will not leave unless my wife also gets one. To this, the official was absolutely rude, rude to the point that he made me stand up from the wheelchair that I had and asked me, in a ruder tone, to wait further. Without an ounce of respect for our age, and consideration of our disabilities or the fact that we have been traveling for more than 16+ hours, he left us to our fate. A young attendant after some time finally came to our rescue with another wheelchair which I was given, while my wife walked slowly behind. If the airport cannot take care of senior citizens, particularly from far off places, then the airport is in no position to boast of service quality. Expect the worst when you travel to or from this airport. Having less facilities is understandable, but a rude behavior from officials should simply not be tolerated. The staff need a lot, a lot of training with customer interaction. This is not my first time traveling to a foreign destination. We have travelled to 12 nations of the world.

2019-08-19,2019-08-19,1.0,"""our awful experience""","  |  We have just returned from a holiday in Canada which was partially ruined by our awful experience at Toronto Lester Pearson Airport. At the start of our trip, we had to change Terminals but, even though we had allowed 2.5 hours between flights, we missed our connection. The airline rebooked us on a later flight with the comment that people are seldom allowed enough time to change Terminals. After the inbound flight it didnt take long to collect our bags but things started to go wrong immediately we set off for the other terminal. We knew, from a little prior research on the Internet, that we would need to take the train. The trouble is there are no clear signs to the trains when you want one. The train makes 3 stops: Terminals 1 & 3 and Viscount - this a car park. Stop announcements are not made so you dont know which stop you have arrived at. Moreover, signs are in English as well as French which is a puzzle since French is 15th in the list of common languages spoken in Toronto. Given that my wife is MENSA qualified and I am retired aircrew I am surprised it took us long to realise that International Departure and Domestic Departures are signed by a picture of a Globe and that of a Maple Leaf thereby avoiding normal lettering used throughout world airports. I suppose this is a brilliant idea to overcome language problems but it doesnt work because Maple Leaf emblems are everywhere. After landing we both headed for toilets only to find the queue for the ladies 20 deep across the walkway and a line in the mens because there were only 2 urinals. Between floors the elevators are nowhere near large enough with the result that shins are banged into by carts. To add to confusion one double elevator is covered in an advertisement but is not identified as an elevator. Its true purpose is given away by the call button. Nowhere is there a sign informing how long it will take to walk to a Gate and directions are not often repeated. I had intended to take my hosts a bottle of whiskey but by then I was in the Domestic Terminal which does not sell alcohol. When we eventually reached our gate there was less than 45 minutes before departure and so insufficient time to accept our hold luggage. On our return we deliberately allowed 10 hours to change Terminals. Even though we had experience of the procedure it still took a couple of hours. We then discovered that we would not be allowed to our airside lounge until 4 hours before departure. To recover our composure we decided to have a drink but we couldnt find a bar or restaurant; however we managed to buy a coffee but then couldnt find anywhere to sit or place a boiling hot cup. In fact there is no seating area nor anywhere so, at the suggestion of the airline, we left the airport for a room in the conveniently located Sheraton. Later, we again set off to drop our bag and then find the lounge at Gate C32. Thanks to use of my iPhone I discovered that this lounge is located as far as possible from the Gate and would take us half an hour to walk. There are no signs informing of this. Once at the gate, I thought it would be rather nice to buy a t-shirt for my 9-year old grandson in the shop. There were plenty to choose from but not emblazoned with an interesting picture of Canada. I could find only those promoting some sports logo known to few outside Canada."

From the time I arrived after an 8.5 hour flight via Air France (which was excellent BTW) my mood quickly changed from relaxed to tense as the entire 777 cabin (260+ passengers!) was remanded into a single line to endure the new 'express' check in kiosks. Useless time waster as staff were unable to handle the capacity of arrivals. Absolutely agitating and embarrassing. Shame on YYZ. The epitome of chaos was a crowd of 70 tired travelers squeezed improperly-and unsafely-at the top of an escalator in a corridor while waiting to process us down to the customs holding area. our YYZ ""handler"" was literally yelling at everyone that customs below ""is too overcrowded and you have to wait a few minutes"" to allow descent. I was humiliated for all the international travelers there, as this is my home city and it showed a complete amateurism in processing us all to a simple customs check out. I could go on again, but safe to say, as a sole business proprietor, I would fire all of the GTAA management and start again- this time with professionals who are respectful to human beings, not cattle herding."

The plane was delayed 15 minutes on the tarmac and then 10 more at the gate when no agent was available to operate the entryway. Then, there was an interminable walk through unmarked hallways to an interminable immigration line. There, after being herded to the automated kiosks, I was herded to wait over 40 minutes for an agent who was gleefully asking smug questions of every U.S. citizens in line, spending an average of 5 minutes with each person. Other lines moved more quickly at this point, so this is clearly a particular agents power trip. At this point, when I tried to find where to re-check my luggage, an agent rudely asked me for when my connnection was. This was the first time I was asked about my connection time, notwithstanding the short layover stickers that had been plastered all over my suitcase. At this point, the rude American Airlines employee told me to go to a different line from the one which I was standing, with now explanation. I assumed, incorrectly, that this was an expedited line, since I still had around 40 minutes to catch my flight. It was not. The door that the rude agent sent me through took me outside of security to the airline agents for rebooking. I learned from another agent that I had been sent there because other agents decided that the remaining 40 minutes was not sufficient for me to make my connection. And, throughout the process, the half-dozen or so staff members that I had the misfortune of interacting with were extraordinarily rude and impassive to the fact that they were part of an inefficient and abusive machine that was making thousands of passengers miserable. Unfortunately, I need to make this same trip for work several times a year. In the future, it will cost me around a hundred dollars to book itineraries on a different airline (probably Delta) in order to avoid this airport. It will be worth every penny."

Instead of needing to show my passport once or at most twice as in modern airports, I had to show my passport a total of eight times within one fifty minute period, in one instance to get into a room and another to get our of the same room. The personnel are petty an officious but that is only to be expected. Standing on line is never fun but it is tolerable if you think that you will be treated equitably. Instead, lines were created, opened and closed for no reason, allowing those who had not waited to be routed ahead of those who had. I was told they were ""special."" That is surprising because some were members of my own party. The USA has transplanted customs to be done at Toronto instead of at people's destination (in this case ATL). That part worked well but came as a surprise since it conservatively added thirty minutes to a 90 minute layover. Probably the worse part was the ground operation for Delta, my connection. We arrived barely in time to get in line only to discover after having stood in line for long minutes, that we had to have our passports ""verified"" (that sterile corridor thing again). That took another ten minutes of standing in a long and slowly moving line to rectify. Al in all we got on as the door was closing and were treated to a steward whose primary interest was getting off on time. he was ""shoveling manure"" not dealing with humans.

But the worst of all was the hot serve-your-self options that were placed under heating lamps in the middle of walkways. Passing travelers were free to touch and stir the food trays, but most did not even buy! All I could think about was the massive amount of global germs that would be deposited in each dish! To make matters even more depressing was the pan handle-like atmosphere where airport employees were harassing travelers to sign up for American Express credit cards. Some became indignant when we refused due to time restraints. One told me, Ahh, come on, you got time, your plane isnt leaving until 2.00! Sadly, however, he or no one else, would help us locate our gate. My husband and I had to be detectives and do our own footwork to locate our planes eventual arrival gate. Finally, the icing on the cake would be the rock-hard stale doughnuts I purchased out of desperation after throwing away my pricey, cold, bland ham and cheese sandwich encased in a soggy roll, layered with smooshed tomatoes and wilted lettuce!

It is dire place, having experienced many modern Asian Terminal buildings, this was worse than any so called third world countries. The Terminal is completely overcrowded, it lacks decent food facilities there is a lack of seating and in my opinion it is filthy. Finally we found it old fashioned and not fit modern day air travel."

When your pilot wishes everyone the best of luck on arrival you know you have problems. We landed at 1:15 p.m. from Heathrow and did not get out until 4 o'clock. By that time our pick-up had left and we had to pay again. Some people had to cradle their small children for a long time as there was very little seating. I would suggest anyone thinking of arriving here on an international flight should break their journey and go through immigration, etc somewhere else and then travel on a domestic flight. We had trouble finding our bags and the airport staff, if you could find one, were unhelpful. Immigration staff were pleasant"

The signs are poorly placed, when they exist. On arrival, finding the rental car shuttles was very badly marked. When I had finally gotten my car - the rental car offices are several miles away - and returned to the airport to pick up my daughter, one of the traffic officials was very unpleasant. There were no other cars in the row I was in or the next row, which were both permitted lanes for picking up passengers. There was room for easily 20 cars. I was typing in the address we were going to into Google Maps, and he came over to insist I leave. We had been there for less than 3 minutes. On departure, we had to walk a very long distance to the gate. If you have any mobility problems, request a wheelchair. Security was very badly run. There were 3 lanes open, but only 2 staff to check boarding passes and IDs. The middle staff member made no attempt to be sure that the left two lanes alternated, and no one bothered to change the lanes to two lanes. When I mentioned the problem to him, he said it was the travelers' fault that they weren't alternating because they were stepping up too fast. The lines at the food counters and in the convenience stores were very long because it is a very busy airport. The staff at the food counters and convenience stores were very nice and helpful. But don't count on having time to get food between flights. When possible, I'll avoid Denver."
2019-09-05,2019-09-05,1.0,"""have never experienced anything like this"""," |  My experience going through customs at Toronto Pearson airport was crazy. Many others complain that the agents were rude but the people I encountered were just plain cruel which was surprising. We arrived three hours before our departing flight and I was traveling with my mom who was in a wheelchair. I escorted her all the way through the airport up to customs. When I tried to go with her through customs an agent began to yell at me stating that if I didnt share a physical address with my mother I would have to go to the end of the line by myself while she was escorted through the handicap line on her own. This wouldnt have been such an issue if I hadnt spent a huge amount of time navigating the airport with my mother in the wheelchair. Additionally, the fact that this agent berated me in public with my wheelchair bound mother right there watching just seemed hateful and hurtful. I missed my flight but my mother made it. As a result she had to wait at the airport in our home town for my flight to get in so I could give her a ride home. Im not sure what the deal is with this airport or the customs there. I have traveled internationally to almost every continent and have never experienced anything like this in my life. I hope this airport and its local municipality work to make the experience for traveler maybe a bit more compassionate if not quicker or easier. Until then, I will avoid this airport and its disgruntled employees like the plague."

Terminal signage indicated that South was less busy than North for getting through security, and indeed it was and it delivers you right outside the Gordon Ramsay restaurant, which is excellent! Flight left from C57, which must be one of the furthest gates from the main terminal. It is also a long walk to the plane from there. Arriving - E-Gates are now the norm for immigration.

Then we had to wait in line over an hour, it wasn't particular full, just not enough windows open. Then we got to the immigration officer, a nice guy, he scanned our passports, which we had already done, he took our finger prints which we had already done, he took our picture which we had already done, and looked over our customs declaration hard copy, which we already had filled out on the first machine. No reason at all to have to wait twice in line for the same thing. After collecting our luggage we had to wait in line again for about 20 minutes just to pass thru the customs officer, only 2 officers were there, before we could exit.

On arrival there was a queue to get to a machine which asked lots of questions which would have been easier and faster with a person or online when applying for the visa. Rather confusing and slow after an 8 hour flight. Then you get a voucher and after walking miles you get to a huge holding pen in a vast hall full of people where you queue again for a what seems like an eternity. Eventually there is a real person who asks you why you are there and sends you on your way. In this vast hall full of people somebody was having trouble with a machine and called out ""Does anybody actually work here"" but there was no answer. So presumably there wasn't! On departure there was a big board saying ""Step 1. Check in at a kiosk. Step 2 Proceed to bag drop"". Unfortunately it didn't say how you identify a 'kiosk', and I queued at the bag drop thinking I was going to a kiosk. The result was it would not accept my bag because I had not got a label (There was nothing to say you need to get a label) so I had to go back to the label printing machine 'kiosk' and then queue again for the bag drop (for 20 mins). The second time round I had to redirect somebody else who had made the same mistake. The end of the queue was at one end of the line of bag drop machines and there was a crowd of people trying to stick their tags onto their luggage in the middle so the next person in the queue could not see the free machines at the far end so stayed in the queue. The result was the machines were heavily under-utilised and the queue was much slower than it needed to be. In fact they only seemed to be used by the few people who lost patience and jumped out of the queue to use them. The kiosk gives you a luggage tag, but there was no explanation of what to do with all the separate peelable parts of the tag so I had to ask one of the 2 very harassed staff members to do it for me. At security there was a woman member of staff heckling the passengers in the queue that they, the staff could process us much more quickly if we weren't so slow and if we didn't do everything wrong. Well there is not much surprise about that. They have the months or years of training and we don't! Perhaps the training is failing if the staff think this is the way to make things work better! Everywhere in the airport all the food was served on disposable plates with disposable cutlery and drinks were served in disposable cups. Conventional reusable china plates and cups seem to be non-existent. It does not need to be like this. This is not sustainable. What happens to all this waste?"

Had US passengers been granted entry with the machines, then waiting wouldn't have been so bad. In the end, filling the card was useless and the machines served essentially to take your picture and to tell you to report to passport control. It took one hour just to leave the airport. Signage was confusing, border agents weren't very friendly and the layout is illogical. I asked the supervisor, apparently everyone speaks to a border agent. Then why are there machines? Leaving, security was a bit slow. I will do my best to avoid this airport in the future."

There is ongoing construction going on at this airport and this construction probably has a lot to do with my horrible experience. Trying to get from the point where the light rail ended at the airport to finally arriving at my departure gate was a pretty bad experience. The signage was confusing and incomplete while navigating around all the construction. The route to my gate was circuitous and aggravating. I had to stop and ask for help more than once. One employee apologized for all the craziness - she said the original company that was contracted for the construction work was ""fired"", and the city is now back to the drawing board finding a new company to do the job. This experience has left me with a bad taste, and until that airport construction is done, I would suggest you avoid flying out of Denver airport."

Secondly, a United bag drop personnel was making such a big deal about me getting their paper tags that were on top of the counter for passengers to use, saying that I should have asked, so why the heck is it on top of the counter without a sign to ask for it?

The staff can be jaw-droppingly dismissive, rude, and insensitive to travelers. Travelers are pointed to lines without any signage or verbal explanations of what to expect, and the lines can long and slow-moving, with no apparent concern about passengers missing flight connections for no good or even known reason. I was in what apparently is the ""immigration rejects"" line, though an ordinary tourist simply in transit between a flight in from the U.S. and a separate flight out of Canada. I have a ""known traveler"" ID in the U.S., and had nothing remotely unusual to declare or explain, but the immigration process (though I was just going from one airport gate to another) took three hours. I saw one woman who apparently took a wrong turn and had discarded her immigration slip being forced to go through immigration again - thereby meaning she would miss her flight connection - beg frantically and repeatedly to be able to talk to a superior instead, but was coldly refused any recourse or consideration, or even a human-to-human dialogue. Forcing the passenger to go through the process again might have been reasonable, but the way the staffer treated the woman was a horrible experience even for standers-by. About an hour later, the guy behind me laughed out loud with gallows humor because about 5 out of 6 of the personnel staffing the processing desks seemed to be having a leisurely huddle together instead. They never even glanced in acknowledgement, much less with reassurance, to all the people they kept waiting that much longer in line."

First time I have missed a flight in over 30 years and I travel weekly. I explained to airport staff directing people that my flight wears boarding as time passed. Nothing they could do.

She then claimed I gave her $120 instead of $140 and wanted another $20. I told her I gave her 7 $20 bills and watched her count them. She acted sheepish and then said I was right. About 20 minutes later, I went to pay for something else. I handed the cashier 2 x $20s and a $5 and asked her to charge the rest on my credit card. When I checked the receipt, she only credited me $25 of the $45 I gave her in cash. I called her out on it, and she gave me back my one $20. It just seems too much of a co-incidence that this happened with two different cashiers. The first cashier was not there when I paid the second time. I then walked up to an officer in uniform and reported it, and while I was doing so, the cashier stopped serving customers and was watching me report the issue. The officer said he was with customs and he was the incorrect person to report it to and that I should speak to a manager. I felt uncomfortable as I was being watched continuously by the cashier. It has been bugging me ever since. Hopefully the right person sees this. It was an Air Canada terminal in the 600s and the flight was to Los Angeles."

I don't think there's any other major hub where that's doable. The rest of the airport is decent. On the plus side, it's a decent size - not as massive as Atlanta, but big enough to be able to stretch your legs if you have time to kill. There's also a good selection of food and drink at the airport, though prices are high. On the other hand, American schedules a lot of short connections through the airport, so you may not have time to enjoy the amenities.

I was told to sit close to the check-in counter and they will come. I waited for half an hour and decided to slowly and with difficulty walk towards the wheelchair assistance counter. When I got there with my daughter, we saw several customers screaming at the lady at the counter. They have been waiting for so long and nobody came to push them. Many were frustrated. Some decided to limp the whole way to the gate as they did not want to miss their flights. When I got to the counter the lady at the counter had my name already and there were so many passengers ahead of me, all waiting in frustration and anxiety. My flight was 6.15 pm and by the time we got a person to push me through, it was 5.30 pm. I barely made it to the plane after the security check. With this delay, I did not have time to stop for restroom or buy some food before the flight. I would say collectively in 2 locations my wait time was 1 hour just for the wheelchair service. And it was 1 hour only because 3 passengers ahead of me decided to limp to their gates and remembering my trip to Texas in July it was the same problem. There was not enough wheelchair assistance to push people who have difficulty walking or unable to walk. Worried that I may miss my flight with my daughter who was flying with me to Texas in July, pushed me as we had our own wheelchair. But this trip, I am on my own and I am depended on assistance. Why is there an acute shortage of wheelchair assistants? Looks like it was not an issue yesterday only. The anxiety caused to these people who are helpless and also I wonder how many people missed their flights and how many planes waited longer than they should for them."

After my mom and I got off our flight, we proceeded to the exit and asked the gentleman if he could help give us directions to the gate of our next flight. He looked up and I quote, ""Look at the T.V. screen. I don't know about that."" I don't know if he was just being lazy or if he really did know his job. Anyway, I walk away and overhear some of the other passengers talking about the same flight so I followed them. Still doubting myself, I ask three other Atlanta Airport employees and they all said the same thing; that they had no clue to that too. At last, I finally had enough of the same answer; knowing that my boarding time was closing in, I asked a pilot if he could help me for a second and he did. I feel terrible that I didn't even catch his name, but I am so thankful that he was able to spare a second to help. Again, I hope that Atlanta's Airport works on their customer service."

The TSA employees are by far the nastiest to traveling public than the security staff at any other airport. I truly believe the TSA staff at BWI actually hate the traveling public for making them work. Most obviously the way African American TSA employees interact with Non-Hispanic white travelers. This racist treatment toward Non-Hispanic whites extends beyond the TSA employees but most BWI employees down to and including the BWI parking shuttle bus drivers seem to have this hatred of people of light skin.

Lots of different stages and ""holding pens"" staff must be highly stressed working there. I arrive here once a year on a visit to family, and the new kiosk entry system has really made things worse. I guess it is either a precaution against terrorists or something to do with preventing cannabis being brought in from elsewhere since the law changed. After a very long walk up and down various steps and escalators you arrive in a customs hall where you are told to find a kiosk with a green light. The explanatory drawing on the machine is not helpful as it refers to an ID card and doesn't tell you you need to put your passport face down. You need to be fairly skilled in inputting into a computer to answer the questionnaire. It takes skill to get your face at the right angle to get your photo taken. Staff try to help but its so busy with confused people, especially those on connecting flights panicking. Its not even clear how to get out of the hall. Staff do their best. They can't indulge in chit chat in such chaos. They must be stressed to hell. They must hate people after working in such conditions. No wonder they don't smile. After another long walk you end up in another hall with those long queues snaking through with barrier tapes. You go through a physical barrier, show your passport and customs receipt, answer more questions, with another long walk through barriers where you show your receipt twice more before you get to the baggage hall. Allow about one hour for all this at quiet times. Do not throw away, lose or screw up the receipt with your face on. You'll never get out otherwise. Before the introduction of this system you used to just join one long queue and clear customs and border control through one exit point. Yes, you queued for ages, but it was simpler. l would describe Toronto Pearson as a modern version of one of Dantes Circles of Hell. I've been through some busy airports like JFK but never experienced such chaos as this. Ditch the kiosks please. Let's have grumpy humans again!"

Also, wearing a uniform does not entitle you to be impolite. I actually experienced a customs officer mimicking my accent. And in the obvious culture of workplace bullying that flourishes in this airport, I was acutely aware that this man clearly wanted me to react so he could pullme out of line.

Two customers at the front started arguing and the staff who had dealt with them were then taken off line, leaving less desks open. Then the longer queue was being called and the priority queue was ignored. At last we got to a desk and the clerk said sarcastically that they were about to close check-in in 5 minutes and we were lucky! Really? Having stood staring at the staff for half an hour while we queued, and having arrived well within the two hours, we didnt feel that lucky! We then headed for the gate. There is no central area to wait prior to the gate, you are sign posted straight to the gate where there is very little seating, and certainly not enough for a large flight. At the gate, there was the usual boarding chaos as there is at all airports. Cant review shops or food as we didnt get the opportunity, and didnt log into wifi."

All olive oil from Spain had to be poured out or checked. On top of extra-long security lines, losing a litre of olive oil to the trash can, the agent was rude as though we should know we could not take duty-free olive oil back. We asked prior to leaving the country and was told it would be fine as long as it was in a tamper-proof duty-free bag with receipt (which it was), but that is not the case.

Don't know the terminal you're going to? Check their website and find your airline's terminal. Queuing times are efficient as they take into account the intense amount of passengers that go through the airport, just not the planes, you'll be waiting 10, maybe 20 minutes waiting to take off, possibly missing a connecting flight. Seating wise, the seats are quite good to rest on for a person who lives quite far from airports. The food is fatty but really tasty. I expected so much less from an airport like this. The staff are genuinely lovely. Especially some of the staff at the UK border that are pleasant to speak to. Overall, a very good airport to fly in if you're not on a time crunch."

There is a short walk to immigration, probably the only plus, and then the confusion begins. They won't have your stroller yet so you carry all of your luggage and small children. There is no family friendly or child friendly service. You wait in very long lines with very poor line management, changing the configuration willy nilly at will and people in the back of the line might be first ones through kind of deal. Then because their long lines are so terrible with poor customer service and direction usually your bags are out on baggage claim. Used to have to wait for that for hours but they've fixed that problem by delaying you elsewhere. Then our bag is lost and nobody knows where it is or really helps in any way. There is no convenient counter to offer assistance. Every person working there is like a free agent, not connected to the larger web. Then you wait in another line to get through baggage and when you voluntarily have one item checked out by animal control they rudely handle your stuff.  Then when you finally find someone at a baggage counter and say 'hello' they don't bother looking up from their phone to say hi back and then are just so not helpful that you decide to run screaming out of this whole place and try your luck on the phone later because humans are incompetent. Lastly forget public transportation, this is also a joke. You now have to walk like a mile to the light rail without the stroller the airport lost and then get harassed by ticket enforcement for good measure.

Rows and rows of happy holiday makers after enjoying gentle British hospitality, cursing the somewhat hostile system of tax refund, obviously aimed at discouraging visitors from claiming what is rightfully theirs, in a cunning, sneaky, unfriendly, money-faced manner. Having travelled extensively, contributing to the healthy economies of a large number of countries, I can safely say this tax refund system and premise to be the absolute worst, even surpassing Pariss CDG many times over. Common sense dictates more counters required for expeditious service, better ventilation (!) in a bigger area, toilet facilities, seating areas for the elderly and those with children and properly functioning lights (basic requirement!).

DTW appears to have been laid out with good intentions, with features like the quick elevated tram and plentiful people movers. Nonetheless, the airport lacks adequate quick-stop amenities that the hurried traveler depends upon. Furthermore, those amenities shut their doors/kiosks well before the final flights have delivered the last weary travelers, leaving them with no option for a snack or drink (other than vending machine). The hiring practices at the airport, particularly the TSA agents and ticket counter personnel, are also marginal. These folks seem to think that being surly is part of their job description. There are exceptions to this blanket statement, of course, and those gems are truly valued. Also, the curbside baggage handlers and Skycaps are typically quite friendly and courteous. (Of course, those gentlemen are often tipped for handling bags.) The security lines are often long, but the floors and facility itself are clean. It looks good.

Also where it eventually brings you up to enter they closed that station so we had to walk even further. After 3 flights in 12 hours it was aggravating. After using free WiFi today out of the country - I tried here to answer the survey. No go. Couldnt connect obviously strings attached for free.

The main thing is it realises it is an airport with shopping not the other way round. Inbound the connections from Domestic to an International can be made in 20 minutes - I have to do it at least twice on Sunday evenings as my flight has been delayed. The signs are clear, the 5A to 5B or 5C shuttle is effcient and never seems crowded. I have access to BA First class or Concorde lounges but have tried other lounges and bars and they all seem good (one in T5 beside the domestic gate lounge is very good at serving rapidly). There are loads of snack type outlets but it doesn't stink of food everywhere. On arrival the e-passport gates and security works very efficiently and I am not sure fast track actually delivers very much. Shopping is very good and I can't fault the terminal cleanliness. Two issues stop it getting a 10/10 - firstly if you are on a remote stand it is a very long bus ride and the buses are not very good, and secondly the have too many slots so if you are on alate out say 21.00-13.00 then you are going to spend a lot of time at the gate or in a queue."

Both times my items breezed through the scanner, but ""I"", who had no metal objects on or in me, had to be scanned twice, and held to a very aggressive body pat-down. They even used two hand held metal scanners to search me and couldn't find a thing. I'm wearing a cotton shit, jeans and socks, no shoes. It took them well over 15 minutes to perform this abuse of power, and for a reason, I have no idea of. These people are truly messed up, I despise them and hope never again to have to go to that horrible airport again."

The majority of the TSA staff at Newark are not just rude ... they shouldn't be assisting people in any capacity whatsoever. The initial 'greeter' was a woman that glared and yelled at every one filling up their baskets in the most hostile fashion that people seemed to be cowering. As you moved thru the line she intermittently yelled at older travelers if they moved to slow, or used the wrong kind of basket (although she didn't do anything to replenish the 'correct' ones to her bays) and generally terrorized the guests. It was actually so absurdly over the top that it was humorous at first until you passed thru the scanner and made it to the other side where the remaining 7-10 TSA employees (definitively more TSA employees than in any other airport that I've seen at any one time), loitered and talked amongst themselves and pointedly refused to assist anyone. They would not make eye contact or converse with guests who were trying to catch a flight. If you can avoid Newark airport in general (all Union restaurant and bartenders) ... and of course I had to wait to review because the wifi is so useless...you'll be happier, but that is just the icing on the cake. If you can avoid Newark TSA 'agents' .. lazy, entitled, abusive, rough and mean. I'd say you've dodged a bullet.

Thankfully, the State of Hawaii appears to be finally, slowly moving to revitalize this ancient relic of air travel, but who knows how long that'll take?! I've flown in or out of Honolulu three times, each time, I've been beyond underwhelmed, and it's legitimately hard for me to even think of anything positive to say about this place (as if you couldn't tell already). To elaborate: The layout had to have designed by a third-grader (and that may even be an insult to third-graders), illogical, seemingly lackadaisical, with unnecessarily long walking with little art work and shops along the way. Oh, and poor signage, as you're approaching and leaving the airport and within the airport. The exterior just looks little better than what I imagine a bombed-out set of the show M*A*S*H would've looked like, but at least there are some neat tropical plants here and there. There is no tram, which makes it horrifyingly handicapped-inaccessible to travel between security, terminals and gates. Few airports I've ever been to seem to have more intentionally curt, unpleasant personnel than Honolulu, whether they're check-in and ticketing agents, TSA, customs and immigration, Starbucks baristas, or bartenders. Security is astonishingly slow and ""un-methodically methodical"", even having TSA Pre-Check helps, but just a little. The only perk is the people who are wearing leis, and greet you into Hawaii with smiles as the plane is disembarking. Just avoid this place if you possibly can, it is easily avoidable if you're flying from the Americas or Europe, if you know what you're doing, but probably not avoidable if you're flying from Australasia or Asia."

Consistently poorly operated, poorly signed, filthy, mismanaged, disorganized, and unkempt. These values are reflected quite adequately in the airport. Add to that long lines even for TSA Pre-Check (TSA seem to want to take their precious times), unpleasant personnel for the most part, and the feeling the airport hasn't been renovated or even cleaned since circa 1986, and, well, I think you can envision this airport if you've never been there. Get it together, New Orleans and Louisiana by first ""un-corrupting"" your governments. On the bright side, with the exception of St. Tammany Parish way off in the North Shore, the airport is probably the safest part of the metropolis."
2019-10-12,2019-10-12,3.0,"""one of the dirtiest I've ever been to""","  | I've flown in and out of George Bush Intercontinental numerous times over the years. Honestly, this is a hard airport to like because it just seems stuck in 1989. But this is also a hard airport to truly dislike, as I've never had a particularly negative experience there. The biggest selling point for me is that I don't ever remember coming across rude or gruff personnel, even TSA during peak traffic hours. I'm sure a rude TSA or ticket agent exists at Bush, because it's a massive American airport after all, but I've thankfully never encountered them! They have a pretty cool display in (I believe) the American terminal which walks one through the evolution of Houston's space program history, nothing fancy or attention-calling, just factual with a few artifacts. There is a selection of decent bars and restaurants throughout, though not much in the way of anything Texas-specific that I can recall. Other than these things, the terminals are dirty. United's terminals are separated and disjointed. Security lines can be painfully slow if you don't have TSA Pre-Check or clear. The airport is honestly one of the dirtiest I've ever been to in the developed world - yes, I just reiterated the point! Seating is very crowed, and so are places to actually charge your phone, iPad, or Kindle. As I said, it looks like the airport hasn't been updated (or, in some cases, even cleaned) since 1989 - when George H.W. Bush, this airport's namesake, was actually president! Some parts of the airport have an indescribably strange smell that I can only describe as dank and damp. The WiFi connectivity is something I'd expect in a developing African country (or Australia, where it's also surprisingly bad). The shuttle bus system from and to economy parking lots is just chaotic and abnormally unsystematic - and illogical. Honestly, if the City of Houston could just improve the layout and dump a lot of money into modernization, Bush would honestly be an amazing airport! Until then, it's like an old lawnmower: just barely running on choke mode while sitting in idle. What a shame."

In 2019, the experience was a real mixed bag, first things first, most people I met working at the airport could not have been friendlier or more helpful. A true positive. Even the TSA personnel and incredibly overworked gate agents were patient yet efficient, though, I know this isn't always the case, as with the overworked yet strangely entitled and lackadaisical barista at Starbucks. Oh well, there always seems to have be at least ""that one"" in airports. However, while I've never had particularly negative experiences, this airport is still not easy to like or embrace. It's clearly outdated, outmoded, and overused, if you've ever watched ""Home Alone,"" which came out in 1990, I'm pretty sure the airport looks today just as it did in 1990 (and even earlier). The airport is dirty all the way around and not well taken care of, even smelling what I can describe as dank and damp in certain areas. Gate seating is not ample. While there are plenty of dining and shopping options both pre- and post-security, many of those options have a sort of dingy feel, no matter how well run they are and how friendly the staff are. The lighting and flooring suck, and even the sporadic display of attractive, futuristic-by-1980s-standards artwork doesn't change that fact. Even though the area of Chicago in which O'Hare is located is generally nice and middle-class, the CTA (Chicago Transit Authority) train station below the terminal has a strangely uncomfortable feeling - and the station and CTA trains are just filthy, even though the station is less than 30 years old (that's CTA's fault, though). Back upstairs, ride shares take longer to arrive and drop off than at many other large airports, even when things aren't particularly crowded. In all, O'Hare provides a poor introduction to, and representation of, an otherwise friendly, vibrant and unique city called Chicago. What a shame."

Departure, waiting in line, is the usual waste of life. The thing that turns me sideways is the baggage handling on arrivals, it is almost as if they do it on purpose, seems the handlers get together and discuss just how they can annoy the passengers. I traveled with three other couples on a trip here and there. This trip back from the national parks in Utah was the worst yet when it came to getting our baggage. Walked off the plane at 9.52 pm and 48 minutes later the planes luggage started in on the wrong belt, it came in on a different one that was labeled for the flight. 48 minutes to get luggage from the plane to the belt. The flight took 160 minutes to move one thousand five hundred and ten miles, it took the baggage handlers 48 minutes to move luggage just hundreds of feet. I do not understand what can be the problem, other than incompetence and lack of concern by the airport/airlines. Oh! If you do not pay attention to what the bottom of you luggage looks like, I would recommend that you learn what it looks like from the bottom, because each and every time your luggage comes down the moving belt it will be upside down. Do you take time to consider how you pack your bag, you know, the stuff you don't mind getting mashed you put on the bottom, well your bag will travel upside down anyway so it doesn't matter how you pack it. The baggage handlers suck at what they do. I hold the airport and the airline responsible. Southwest needs to straighten up. In this review, I have given the individual review categories all one star, having to wait on your luggage for way to long of a period takes away from the experience as a whole."
2019-10-16,2019-10-16,1.0,"""asked multiple employees to help and nobody did""","  | I had a flight today from Newark Airport into Detroit. I got to the airport at 8.45 for a flight that was scheduled to depart at 10.05. I had 3 bags, so I knew I needed to check one of the bags. Most airports let me check a bag at the gate. I have done so at Newark before. The TSA Worker stopped me and asked me to show her my boarding pass before I entered the security line as expected. Than she told me that I had 3 bags and therefore had to go downstairs to check one. I than said that I planned on just checking my bag at the gate. She said ""downstairs"". And I said ""wait can't I check it at the gate"". She said I wasn't allowed through until I went downstairs. So I went downstairs. The staff were very unhelpful and the lines were ridiculous. When I finally checked my bag. I went back up to the security line. The same worker as before was trying to tell me I couldn't have 2 bags and had to check the other (which clearly isn't true, your allowed a personal bag and a carry-on bag). They were both small backpacks so its not like they were big. I think she may have been trying to take advantage of the fact that I'm a freshman in college and look like I don't know what I'm doing. I'll give her the benefit of doubt and say maybe it was miscommunication though as she wasn't clear and kept just saying ""check bags downstairs"" and wouldn't really answer my questions. I then was in the security line. The signs said 15-20 minutes. This was at 9.05, so an hour before my departure time. The line was moving pretty slow, so along the way I asked a couple of workers if they could help me since my flight was pretty soon. They said no, which was understandable considering I still had 30 mins until boarding started, and the lines were only ""15-20 minutes"". At about 9.25 (boarding starts at 9.40, ends at 9.50), I was still pretty far back in the line and it was clear the line wasn't moving. I then again asked the original TSA worker to help me as she was right next to me at this point. She said ""I can't do anything about it. If boarding starts in 10 minutes the gate is already closed."" First off that doesn't even make sense. The gate closes after the boarding ends. Anyway I kept on going through the line, and I was pretty close when it was 9.40 (boarding start). However, the line was going very slowly. I got to the point where you put your bags onto the belt at 9.45, 5 minutes before the gate closes. Since there were so many people putting their bags on their, my bags weren't being moved into the moving line. I asked the worker if she could put my bags in quickly since I had a flight to catch. She just stared at me with a blank stare. A kind man and a woman behind me asked me when my flight boards. I explained that the boarding started 5 minutes ago. They both said that it was ridiculous that they had seen me ask multiple employees to help and nobody did. The 2 people in front of me heard the conversation and let me move in front of them to try to make my flight. I got out of security at 9.48 and sprinted to the gate. When I got there at 9.51, there were 0 employees at the gate, and none at the surrounding gates either. I eventually found an employee at a gate 6 away from mine. He was the most helpful employee of the day. He told me to go to customer service and helped me get a new free ticket for a flight 4 hours later. It turns out that the flight left 10 minutes early and they closed boarding early as well. Terrible service. I'd rate them a 0/10 if possible."

Instead, the officers in my lane kept laughing and cracking jokes about ""the supervisors not doing their job"". They should be more sensitive and considerate of all the anxious people waiting to get to their flights. One guest in the lane next to mine remarked that his plane was leaving soon and he might miss his flight, to which the officer sarcastically replied, ""That's unfortunate."" without even giving the guest a glance. Another guests 2 kids had passed through the security gate right before the machines stopped, so he approached the officer after about 10 min and asked if the kids could come back through to stand in line with the parents so they wouldn't be waiting alone. The same officer mentioned above replied in an aggressive manner that ""they've been randomly selected and they'll be selected again when they come back in."" What he's saying is not wrong. It's how he said it that rubbed me, and undoubtedly the father, the wrong way. You could tell the father was annoyed because he simply didn't want his kids to be alone. My negative experience was mainly due to 1 or 2 officers, but there is obviously a work culture that tolerates this kind of behavior. There were other officers around that said nothing to correct the abovementioned officer's rude behavior. I have traveled a lot in my life, and can deal with a bit of rudeness, but this was over the top. Please, train the officers to be better people, which in turn will make them better employees. The Denver Airport processes many, many people each day, and bad employee behavior should not be an impediment."

When i went to recheck my bag in the belt had broken so they were using buses to terminals where you had to carry your baggage onto and as i was now out of the terminal had to clear security again at terminal C causing further delay, i ran to the gate and my flight was just boarding.

The whole part of that building was bus station like with only one small shop. It was very much amateur hour that evening on gate 138 because the check in staff had been looking without success for a bus coordinator for the last 90 minutes. No bus coordinator equals no bus!.

I asked him which gate gate we were going from which was gate right over the the other the end and would take me 10 mins to walk to and it was a good 10 mins. Duly arrived at the gate expecting my wife to turn up in the buggy - passengers were starting to turn up for the the flight no sign of my wife. She had the bag with our boarding passes in passports. Was getting concerned where she was there were only handful of passengers left. Luckily there was a supervisor there and explained what was going on, he checked and said they had gone straight to the plane and took my name and came back with my boarding pass and passport. I was the last one to get on, not good enough, she did laugh, but its hard enough making sure she is ok without having to worry about getting on the flight. She said 2 lifts were out of order and they had obviously taken the scenic route.

It's one of the most efficient security I've been through. Once passed security there were plenty of shops or sitting areas with charging facilities. The terminal was clean and airy. On arrival we were connected to jet bridge in no time and was out of the plane very quick. Early evening on a Sunday with multiple wide bodied planes landing resulted in longer immigration queue. However the queue kept moving fast and most of the e gates were in operation. From landing to clearing immigration it took me less than 25 minutes despite the busy landing time. The only disadvantage or slightly negative experience on T2 is the long walk between the main building A and the satellite gates B (where most long haul flights depart/arrive). You have to go down and up on long escalators.

I foolishly left a rolled up piece of native Australian Artwork on a seat outside of Gate 16 - A beautiful souvenir that I bought in Darwin and one that I was really excited to hang in my home as a memory of my trip. I was a bit flustered while getting to the gate - as many are in airports, and as a consequence I left my souvenir on the seat. I realised this on the flight and when I landed in Melbourne, I first asked The Virgin Airlines staff to help me - which they refused, telling me its not their issue and to contact Lost and found. I immediately contacted lost and found, only to be told that it will either be stolen or handed in. Even though I described to them exactly where it would be - after only an hour in transit - the women refused to send someone to check if it was there, claiming that is 'not part of their policy'. Really, how difficult is it to just check if somethings there or not? Its a darn shame that I left it there, but im also really saddened by the lack of support that Adelaide Airport and Virgin airline Staff offered me. Not a pleasant airport experience at Adelaide Airport."

That would have completely altered this entire experience for the better. I tried parking in remote parking. I got turned around, twice, and was lucky it was not more. Remote parking is remote. Not quite Timbuktu, but by the time you figure out the signs, it feels similar. I ended up parking in the south remote parking. When I took the exit, there was a T in the road, and there was a sign that said this road this way, that road that way, and absolutely nothing about where I might find remote parking. Seriously. Nothing. I turned the wrong way, because I am an idiot sometimes, and Murphy has a law. Then the shuttle dropped me off at an elevator for E33 instead of E12. There was no signage for E12 anywhere. He said to go up the elevator and down the hall because he doesnt stop down there. So I ran half a mile after the kiosk didnt work (add on to all this I was later than planned, so couldnt check-in at the kiosk to print my pass), and kept having to ask where it was I was going, as there were still no signs. I got my boarding pass and tried to find the right security. Those also are not signed. They make their employees answer the same questions all day every day from clueless people like me. I felt horrible. Angry (at myself and them). Frustrated. So frustrated. Stupid. Because DFW failed to properly communicate. They made it so difficult to have a smooth, calming experience. As a result, it shall take me a considerable amount of time to get this taste out of my mouth. Perhaps it will leave when they improve the usability of their signage. It would be such a simple fix! Until then, I shall try to find some redeeming quality. My fellow passengers seem nice. The sun is rising now, which looks quite beautiful. The temperature in here also seems decent. And theres a pretty piece of bubble-like artwork at my gate that does a nice job of catching the eye."

Long lines of unhappy people ordered around like cattle. Ive previously missed connecting flights due to extremely long wait times in immigration. On departure, surly staff are needlessly rude. Security is a joke with little understanding of the concept of flow. Terminal 7 is small with very basic amenities. Ive travelled internationally every month for the last 25-years, and in my experience, JFK is one of the worst airports in the world.

My incoming AA flight from LHR was forced to wait for the gate to be ready once we arrived, and then once at the gate, we had to wait again to de-plane because Customs (Immigration/CPB) was backed up. Once we reached customs, it took over an hour to get through due to long lines and literally one CPB Officer processing inbound US Citizens. Once we were past Baggage Claim and Baggage Re-Check, the transfer from Concourse D to Concourse E took a ridiculous amount of time as the ""Moving Sidewalks"" were non-oprational. Once we finanlly arrived in Concourse E, the food and drink options were horrible (Burger King and Panda Express? Seriously?) Then our connecting flight was delayed due to late arrival of inbound flight, again because of poor Ground Operations. Finally, once we boarded, we were delayed again due to taxiway congestion. This is the most poorly managed airport I have ever traveled through and I will never book another flight through this airport. The levels of mismanagement were far worse than even bad Third World airports. Avoid CLT at all costs. You're welcome."

There is very little I can consider as even pleasant about this airport. I have been a KLM Platinum frequent Flyer for the last 8 years and do over 40 flights a year in and out of Manchester to Amsterdam and then onwards through to Asia/US/Europe etc. For the convenience I use Manchester and mainly because of its rail connection between York and the airport (even this has its moments of despair but that's for another day) From the moment I step of the train I see nothing but faces (station platform through to airport security) that are really not interested in what they do and far less interested in people travelling through, in fact ""passengers"" are their nightmare. The Northern rail staff are horrendous, rude and ignorant. Do you know there are no ""TV Screens"" anywhere displaying the departures of trains until you have actually gone through the ticket barrier and entered the platform zone before one can find out the times and destinations of a train ... pathetic, and try asking any of the station staff for that information is as if you have requested them to give you 20. Passing through the ticket barrier on the 24th Oct at about 09:00 hours I counted 10 staff members on the inside of the barrier stood in pairs, my ticket was ""rejected"" by the barrier sensor so the gate remained closed, I tried to draw the attention of a staff member of my predicament, first think I was asked, do you have a valid ticket? Yes Sir I do. ""Let me see it"" by all means Sir, he scrutinised my ticket and said ""Is in order and should work"" Well well well what a surprise, I was instructed to try it again. Nope the barrier remained closed, he called a colleague who also checked my ticket and would you believe it they had to bring in a 3rd fellow with a ""magic key"" to open the barrier, which did not work, and I had to use another barrier and try my ticket again there to no avail, before a new key was introduced and I was eventually allowed to gain entry to the ""railway side of the platforms"" My principle terminal for KLM is T3, probably the longest walk from the station and I mean walk because the travelators' scarcely work, over the past 3 weeks (I have has 6 visit's in this time in and out) there has been a group of ""engineers"" working on them and just yesterday I returned, no engineers and the travelator heading out was inoperative. Just a word of caution on this walkway from station to T1&T3 when it rains the floor is a hazard but to the leaking arch roof. The elevators to get to down from the walkway to the level where T3 pathway are so slow when there are so many users about, I have found an alternative route via T1 arrivals but my word its a straggle. Depends on airline I suppose for check-in but I generally use KLM/AirFrance with a priority pass through ""security"" thankfully but this is another experience in itself, miserable people employed to ensure you don't have liquids, gels, electrical stuff etc. I'm done moaning as I have better things to do but I'm back in to T3 again on Monday 28th Oct with KLM and returning (Airfance 7th Nov) and do you know I'm expecting the same shambles as I have seen for so many years already.

The airport tries to be modern (or sees itself at least this way) and automatizes everything from Check-In to baggage drop-off, but as it frequently happens, the loss of human beings is paid with chaos and confusion. You even have to print out your baggage tags yourself - if you are used to that as Canadian, this might be okay, but as a foreigner you first get lost at this airport as there is no competent or helpful staff to support this. Due to that automatic nonsense it is for example not possible to drop off your baggage earlier than three hours before your flight - that is well-known from airports in Africa, but in other airports, e.g. Frankfurt, you can check in and drop off your baggage already 24 hours before. In Toronto they only try to sell their airport lounges (only online of course, because at that time you don't know what you have to expect) and when you arrive at the airport, you cannot use them (although booked per hour), because you are not allowed to drop off your baggage - needless to stay that the run-down state line Air Canada does not inform you about that before.

It pains me to give this shameful verdict on this, my regional airport that I have to endure as a frequent traveler. The unpleasantness starts from the approach to the airport, to the shambolic check-in areas, security and baggage handling.

When she said she is 80, they virtually shoved her toward another lane and said: you go here without any explanation. We were then separated.

From the Fox Rental Car shuttle the bad treatment started, and it just got worse. Nearly every 'service' person we dealt with, from the American Airlines check-in, to the shop assistants, TSA, Burger King lady, and nearly every AA representative we were forced to deal with was breathtakingly rude, and sometimes downright bullying. And my husband and I are very polite and patient people. We spent the night in the freezing airport due to AA incompetence and got nothing but hostility from nearly everyone we (politely) approached for help or information. When we were finally put on a plane with the help of one American Airlines employee, I witnessed at least four other passengers being treated terribly for no reason. It's like they are trained to abuse their clients. The icing on the cake was the 2 AA cabin crew members getting into a very loud fight in the back of the plane. The tension on the plane was palpable. I've never experienced this in my life, and suddenly the news reports about passengers flipping out on planes seemed understandable. I'm not surprised, if it happens on American Airlines, and guess what? It would be totally the fault of those employees. Terrible, shameful treatment of their clients. I will never fly AA again, and will never pass through McCarron airport again. Beware!"

The taxi phoned us to say he had arrived but it turned out to be a ten-minute walk to the pick-up point, I had to leave my wife trying to walk slowly behind me who eventually couldn't go any further so I had to go back and get her a wheelchair.

The restaurant selection was very good, but as all airports, pretty over-expensive. The cleanliness of the washrooms was extremely questionable, but the cleanliness of the terminal was incredible. My gate was not one of the newly renovated parts, so it did not have iPads or seating; but I found a very close restaurant and seating, however, my only source of entertainment, my phone died. But luckily, the terminal provided not only a standard Canadian/American outlet, but a USB port. Now, for the boarding.

Arriving after a 2.5hr flight at Heathrow, with 90 minutes to change flights. First you need to go through exact the same security check as in Helsinki. Security staff yelling and threatening people to listen to them or else they will be delayed. Here you are as a parent trying to get your family to another plane for a nice and stress free vacation. Unfortunately I forgot to take 2 iPads out of my bag. A simple mistake. The security staff took my bag (and several other bags of criminals, including an old English lady who clearly had difficulties understanding the instructions) to put it aside for at least 15 minutes before eving looking at it. The bag and iPads now needed some special investigation and it took another 15 minutes before I had my bag back. While I was waiting I could see several other people in the same situation, staff not trying at all to help the travelers, staff yelling and cursing at people for not putting the trays at the correct place. We had to run from the security check to the gate, me carrying a crying 3 year old, and a 7 year old trying to keep up. What a relief to make it to the gate and meet the incredible nice and friendly staff of British Airways. I feel bad for them, but I will never fly again via Heathrow. We had plenty of alternatives to fly to Miami, but thought Heathrow was a world class airport. Oh and the glass bottle of liquor I bought at Helsinki airport tax free and had with me in the flight to Miami. Not a single word to get that through security."

Commands were shouted and if not complied with immediately further abuse was received. I purposely wear a plastic belt to enable easy pass through security but an officer barked at me to remove it. I accidentally left a hotel key in my pocket and this gave me the pleasure of a full body pat down including my crotch and hand swab. My carry on had to re x-rayed because I failed to separate all items as requested and I was suitably chastised for my inability to complete their orders. In addition they insist on shoe removal, even when I was wearing plastic flip flops.

We were instructed to place our bags on a conveyor to be routed to our next flight prior to checking in for our next flight via Air Canada. We had to go through Canadian customs and another terminal for our connector, where we needed to go through another round for U.S. customs. By the time we were in front of the U.S. customs, were told that our bags didnt clear and had to wait at a holding room, they called Step 2. Bottom line: we missed our flight and no one in Air Canada or the airport knew where our bags were. They all collectively blamed us and no one took responsibility. They made us go back and forth from terminal 1 to 3, 4 times as one would claim that the other terminal had them. From 5.30 pm till 11 pm, no one could retrieve the bags, even when their computers finally identified them. We had to book a night at the airport Sheraton to sleep a little. We got to the terminal to check in at 5.30 am for an 8 am flight and again was told by U.S. customs that our bags didnt clear for travel. Step 2 again and no one could find the bags, till we told the Air Canada agent that at 11 pm their baggage services found them. We were 5 minutes till boarding and cleared for step 3. Our flight was forced to delay for 30 minutes because 55 passengers were stuck at step 2 and 3 to clear. Is the Sheraton airport the only party benefiting from the inefficiencies? Furthermore, why does the Toronto airport authority not fixing this?! Lastly, there has to be some compensation for the grave inconvenience via hotel accommodation reimbursement, so they will be motivated to fix the problem."

This must be where TSA sends the most crotchety agents to retire. Get your tickets out, were not standing here making you sandwiches!, exclaimed the TSA jerk in the middle of the line. The only individual not barking orders was the drug sniffing dog. Truly a horrible representation of the airport and the US. I will never go through Dallas-Fort Worth again.

I was told to go towards baggage claim and followed the signs until I made it to the door that that said baggage claim, I didnt want to proceed any further at that point so I decided to turn back. There was a security officer that was sitting back having an evidently personal conversation on the phone telling the person on the line One sec then proceeded to tell me to leave the area towards baggage claim. I tried to explain the situation but she refused to have me talk and gestured me away rudely with her long fake nails (definitely not what airport security should have on). I proceeded and went through security again. When I finally find the ICE, the teller was extremely rude. She could not understand the verification code so to communicate better I politely handed her my phone to see the code clearly. Rather than use the written documentation she passed my phone back in a manner that made it seem like my phone was carrying a disease and she said no you have to talk clearly as if I wasnt speaking proper english (which is my first language). The staff in this airport have very poor customer service skills that many other airports are very strong in (especially in Narita Japan). This airport needs to fund the training for their staff or needs to discipline those that have poor skills. Unacceptable behaviours. Not Canadian at all."

The bathroom smells like a portable toilet on the third day of a rugby tournament on a hot summer day in Georgia. It's so hot and humid in here that my knees are sweating, not the back of my knees, my kneecaps. I live in Hawaii and I'm used to not having air conditioning, but this would be much more tolerable if you could at least get a beer. Next time I leave, I'll see if I can just be a stowaway on a cargo ship. It would be about as comfortable and wouldnt cost $1000.

I have several metal implants holding my spine together, and I told the TSA woman this. She insisted on doing her pat-down, which whatever, do your job, but she was so rude, and aggressive in her demeanour. She basically told me to shut up at least twice. Her partner was a man, and he was so embarrassed by her behaviour that he wouldnt even look at me. Its a very busy place, and once I went thru the full-body scanner, I didnt hear it beep and there was no indication that I was not permitted to proceed, and it was someone else instructing me. So, I went to grab my things out of the grey box to get out of the way. She says to me, I didnt say you could leave. Ok, I responded. Then she says, stand on that mat, and dont move, but instead of asking as a normal person would, shes talking to me like Ive done something wrong. She then informs me shes doing a pat-down, and she now has myself and two other ladies waiting for the same treatment. She then asks me if I have pain anywhere, I responded yes, I have pain in my back, she says again with needless aggression, I didnt ask you about your back, I asked you if you have pain in the front (which was not what she said). Shes yelling this at me. She says Im not patting down your back like I was somehow supposed to know what she meant! So, again I corrected myself, and I responded with no, I have no pain in my front. Then she does her pat-down but is going around my yoga pants waistband to my back and down my legs. Maybe the TSA could use a crash course to teach their representatives some basic anatomy as she most definitely was patting down my lower back. I also was holding my passport, you know normal behaviour to have your passport in hand in an airport, she says, put your passport down! Then she swabs my hands, she actually looked disappointed when she couldnt find anything. Is this the way they treat visitors to their country? That was the most disgusting behaviour Ive ever witnessed and experienced in an airport, ever! Im all about keeping everyone safe, these safeguards are put in place to protect all of us, I agree with screening 100%. Nobody deserves to be treated like that. My disabilities are a big part of my life, and I do my best to fit in with everyone else, this woman should not have a job dealing with the public. She demonstrated quite proficiently that she has no regard for those with disabilities. Shame on you for treating people like this! You should be ashamed of yourself.

Our flight was scheduled to leave at 6am, so we arrived a little after 4am. We breezed through check-in at the Delta counter with zero issues. Everyone was kind, professional, working efficiently, and quickly checked our bags in, printed our boarding passes, and directed us to security. A quick trip up the escalator and we were greeted with an enormously, annoyingly excessive long security line. Though the electronic signboard stated the minute-long wait for TSA pre-check, priority boarding, and regular, they informed us all lanes were closed but regular. This was was the first major slow down. Next, there was a large number of TSA agents per customers, the majority were dry, cold, and lacked professional courtesy/basic customer service (and some were just straight up rude) as they pushed people through this single lane and barked repetitive reminders about the speed in which to walk past the dog, etc. We are frequent flyers and have seen many other airports use the police dogs much more effectively than Newark. Why cant they take a page out of JFKs or DCAs policy and just keep the line moving at a normal pace and have a lane for the dog to pass everyone? This was the second major slow down. We finally get to our security scan belt around 535am, knowing our flight is already boarding. They switch out TSA people to watch the screen, which stops our line. They yell over and over that nothing may be in a bin except large electronics and edibles. Again, the cold, curt way in which we were spoken to was unacceptable. We finally make it to the scanner and Im randomly selected for additional screening. That didnt take as long as I thought it might, but again, Im now fearful Im going to miss my flight that takes off in 15 min. No one cares. That was the third slowdown. We get through security to then be yelled at to take our shoes to a bench to put them back on... why cant anyone show a bit of kindness???? Meanwhile, nearly everyone was passing, in front of or behind, us complaining about how horrible security was today. Why would they not open until 430am knowing people are scheduled to board 6am departing flights at 530? We made our flight but did get to the gate after boarding had already begun. I will be doing everything in my power to avoid the Newark airport for future travel and will tell my friends and family to do the same."

If you struggle walking any length do get assistance. We've just landed and here's how it went. Touch down, add 15 minutes for taxiing to gate. Add about 30 minutes for the long walk back to your bags- passport control etc. Now add about an hour for your bags, remember they have to travel all the way from the plane too. We touched down at about 8pm and left the airport at 9.40. Whoever is responsible for the build and design of that terminal needs sacking and it's quite clear that they had no idea on movement of people.

We arrived at Terminal 5 but we were at the C Gates, so we were required to travel to the main terminal by train. It was around 5 in the morning and at least 2 flights had landed with a large number of passengers. There was only one train available that needed to take people back to the main terminals before returning to the C Gates and back and forth, so this took longer than expected. We were then required to go through security again however there were no signs or guides advising that we needed to do this. In some other international airports that we have connected, there is no need to go through security checks again. Because we only had 2 hours to connect, we decided we would try and head straight over to our gate before going to the toilets etc., but we encountered security instead. The queues were all over the place and you could see everyone was a bit fed up at this point. I had just come off the plane with at least 500ml of water left as well and instead of being helpful, I was shouted at for having a large bottle of water and was told to empty it on the spot by drinking it all (seriously?) or the security guard would bin my water bottle (was desperate for the toilet as well at this point). When we told her that nobody informed us that there would be security checks again, she shrugged and told us we should've emptied it in the toilets - obviously, I would've done that if I knew we had to go through this again! Overall she was incredibly rude, treated us as if we were stupid, put the blame on us and made our experience absolutely awful. If I had gotten her name I would've made a formal complaint.

We should've known with this state and city what to expect, and it was no surprise the lack of concern the staff showed either! Thank God for the kiosks at the ticket counters because hopefully these will replace some of the atrocious, rude, lazy staff that you currently have in place! That'll be a huge improvement for you guys, so I can't wait for this continued transition! We also waited 40 minutes from the time we deplaned for our luggage!

I did carry-on only, but the baggage claim area had large signs saying not to expect bags to be delivered until at least 30 minutes after the flight. I got through, and once in the public area it was easy enough to get Canadian cash, buy a bus ticket, and find the bus into town. Departing back to the US was more disappointing. The trusted traveler lane was closed when I tried to go through security, and while the CATSA website says that trusted travelers can get front of the line privileges when the lane is closed, this was not honored at the airport. The security clearance procedure was also confusing; for example, while they require all suitcases to go into trays on the X-Ray, there were no signs explaining this, leading to a delay in getting through while the security officer helped me to find extra trays for my bags. Once through Security and US Customs the transborder terminal seems nice enough, though in common with a lot of airports the food and goods for sale were quite expensive. While Montreal is a decent enough airport, I feel that it would benefit from more signs explaining what is required at immigration and security."

The plane houses over 450 people and when I asked if they could open a new check in desk as 3 were open they said Manchester Airport doesn't give the facility for this to occur. The duty free options are over priced and can be seen as money making. It cost me over 17 for a 2 person meal in burger king something that you'd never pay out in the UK. The whole airport is centred around making money rather than the experience it's passengers have. T2 is dated and not really an experience anyone should want to go through.

Eventually being hoarded onto an over crowded bus which was supposed to be to the terminal, everyone had to get off and stand in the snow and raining for a further 20 minutes to transfer bus. Again no JFK employees were available to co-ordinate the situation. Having finally arrived and boarded the plane, we sat on the plane for 3 hours beyond our scheduled departure. With the captain stating no one at JFK Flight Control was able to be contacted - destining the situation like a circus. Several other flights were in the same situation.

A security screening system which is totally over the top compared with any airport I have visited anywhere in the world. Even mascara is considered a potentional threat to the safety of the aircraft! An asthma ventolin inhaler loose in the tray was rejected as not in a plastic bag. When asked why this was a problem was told terrorists use them as detonators. Presumably outside the plastic bag they are undetectable, but inside, can be. All in all, a Mad Hatter's Tea Party.

I drove up the ramp to park and at that point, past the point of any return, and found a barrier blocking what had been the entrance to the car park, and a diversion sign. There were two staff members some distance along and when I drove up to them they explained that this was the first day of a new process under which only pre-booked cars could use that car park. (Good luck with that-my experience of pre-booking that car park has been that it is still very stressful trying to find a space.) They directed me to another car park, using a pre-printed card which they showed me but did not hand over. I could not find it and ended up parking at terminal 3 and walking with my son back to terminal 1, but I still had to pay 3 for 1 minute to get out of the car park I hadn't been allowed into, plus an additional 4.50 for the 21 minutes at terminal 3. So 7.50 for 22 minutes. This is nothing more or less than gouging in my opinion.

She did not come to the car nor give a ticket, so I am not quite sure why the explosive language and looking at the license plate. Her level of professionalism was pitiful and completely uncalled for. It was a poor reflection of her position. The rest of the experience at the Kansas City airport was super friendly and pleasant, as usual. My rating is solely based off of the explosive security woman. I reccomend this airport, but strongly believe someone should address the exiting lanes with class and clarity."

They have recently changed their RideShare policies and force their customers to be dropped off and picked up in a very inconvenient area that they have to walk to with all of their bags etc. simply because they are worried about the taxi revenue. Taxis are so scarce in Boston that there is literally no other way to travel to the airport. Do they expect me to walk several miles from my apartment? Im very confused as to why anyone thought this was a good idea and it makes me not want to use this airport.

I ended up standing in the customs line for a 1:45min. I talked to 3 workers who were ""in charge of managing the lines if I could skip the line ... they said no"" I asked the customs agent if I could cut in line and he says ""sorry not our problem"" Mind you that there were only 2 agents working the whole time. So after already accepting that I missed my flight (boarding time was at 8:05), I get to the baggage area where there were no signs saying where my bag would be because it already been close to 2 hours since we landed. I find my bag thrown in a pile of other suitcases. I get to my airline desk explained the situation and they rebooked my flight .. great! But they made me go through security all over again which ended up costing me another hour to which I barely ended making my rebooked flight by 5 min! If you can avoid this airport at all costs, go to SJC or even Oakland they'll probably take better care of their passengers. It is ridiculous how we do not use computers like many European countries as customs! Very outdated methods that are broken.

However, once it was my turn to go through (noted I was only 2 people behind my wife) I was pushed to the other side of the metal detector machine instead in which we had ask for my wife to go through. Once the scanner had done its job she was expected to hop with one leg out of the machine since her crutches were being scanned. She was holding up the line, so the TSA tried to assist her by putting hands on her, but obviously my wife couldnt take the help since she is not able to maneuver without the crutches. This was so humiliating in all aspects. TSA officers need to go through a sensitive and judgement course in which they are thought to be human beings and make better decisions. The supervisor was rude and backed her employe even though she was wrong. She continued to argue that her employee was not aware of the anxiety she was causing my wife, she had a meltdown while being patted down.

The area was packed with passengers with no security in sight. After checking in at a kiosk and receiving a boarding pass and luggage tag, I was approached by an elderly European gentleman and his ""daughter"" asking me to assist them with putting their passport into the kiosk. After placing an obviously foreign passport (by the cover) into the kiosk, it showed that their passport was not valid and so they had to attend at a physical check-in desk for help. I pointed to where they had to go and as they disappeared into the throng of travellers, I turned to find my backpack gone. Inside were my passport, large sum of cash, all travel documents for 7 flights and 4 hotels in Thailand, credit/debit/health cards with driver's licence, new iPad/earphones and a litany of other travel items. After an initial frantic search, I made my way to the police booth which was halfway along the terminal. Here I was told to ""fill out a report on-line"" despite being scheduled to fly out in 2.5hrs. In the end, I was directed throughout the terminal to various locations including airport Lost & Found, AirCanada Lost & Found, Border Services Agency and other areas looking for my bag. Police and ""public safety"" officers who attended sometime later were of no help and upon my request only contacted video surveillance only to be told that ""no cameras covered that area where the theft occurred? Post-911 and an international airport has no surveillance on one of the busiest areas of the airport where the national airline checks in its passengers? Police advised that theft and fraud is rampant at the airport with groups of organized criminals operating daily on an unchallenged basis throughout the terminals and that many crimes go unreported as victims often leave the country without filing any report but crime warning signs are nowhere to be seen. As a Canadian citizen, however, my situation was different and somewhat catastrophic and almost ten days later, still requires paperwork, phone calls and expensive replacement of documents. Needless to say, my bag and contents were never found as of this this date. I lost my vacation, I lost my money, I lost my passport and tickets, I lost my electronics and almost all of my personal financial details under the nose of the Airport Authority and according to them, with no recourse for recovery or reimbursement! Welcome to Toronto Airport. Surely one of the world's worst international airports with serious security gaps, rampant crime and no way of recouping your losses!

We are welcome to be on the cold, cement floor at baggage claim and have to be rechecked through security in the a.m. Are you kidding me? I've stayed overnight in airports throughout the states to catch connecting flights. They said the airlines should have told me this. Thanks for the hospitality for weary travelers. All airports should have areas where travelers can rest warmly and somewhat confortably. People can get stranded or not have the time or money to get a room and get back early, utterly ridiculous. Plus, on the other side of security you're somewhat safe, any unticketed person can sleep out here. Unless the security loudly zooming on motorized standup bikes makes things better.

Then the machine was unable to print a baggage tag so off to another line to get that looked after. Then another line to put the bag into a bewildering automated bag handling machine that required another attendant to help me with. Once done, the rest of the check-in and boarding process went ok but for the life of me I don't understand why they try to board 250+ people through one door. On the return trip, the arrivals process was even more chaotic. International arriving passengers are diverted to a very long upstairs passageway and two of the moving sidewalks were out of service. The very first washroom you encounter halfway down this passageway has exactly one urinal and one stall. You can imagine the lineups when 130 or so men get off that airplane. Terrible design. Then the idiotic and intimidating automated immigration and customs machines (they need to take a picture of you so stand still!) and that, after all that, spat out a piece of paper that actually misspelt my last name!

Not a single person organising the queues. Right after the control, you don't have another choice but to land in a shopping centre and have to zigzag through shops and aggressive staff trying to sell you perfume and alcohol, this can take up to 5 min to complete. We arrived at the airport 2.30 hours before the departure at 6.00 am but we had no time to have breakfast as we were all the time waiting on queues for everything. We crossed the boarding gate and had to wait 30 min with no seats available even for pregnant women. Once we were in the plane had to wait another hour until our flight number was given a slot to take off, this is also easyJet's fault as they rarely are on time. Never again flying from Gatwick."

Then took my 17 year olds bag away without explanation to the walkthrough screening out of view, wouldnt answer where theyd were taking bag, squatted and searched out of our view and sent bag back. My visibly upset, crying, angry daughter was made fun of by TSA so I said that it was wrong to make fun of a kid. He said he was communicating with his coworker to see if he was in trouble. Communicating in customer service is asking if coworker needs help. He was just being a mean person. Then the man asked if she wanted to speak to a supervisor, and my daughter said yes. TSA agent simply walked away telling everyone he didnt know why she was so upset. When my daughter opened her bag, nothing but her underwear was touched (it was on a pocket on side of the bag).

He rolled himself from the luggage to where United Air collected luggage. We then had to go through TSA again. I inquired about pre-check in TSA and the official directing people yelled at me and because of her strong accent I couldnt understand her. When I asked her again she just got furious and turned her back on us. We ended up in the non-pre TSA which was a nightmare with all our carry ons and a wheelchair. They took the wheelchair away and made my husband go through a complete search because his arm and hip replacements set off the equipment. Finally we reached the United Gate and they were almost through boarding even though we allowed plenty of time for this transition. We were sent out in the rain to get to our plane to San Luis Obispo. Because of the weather, they needed 8 volunteers to get off the plane for weight reasons. Finally they decided to remove all the baggage so o one had to leave the plane. (Good idea). The plane took off 1.5 hours late. United Air did a good job of Tracking our luggage. It went down to LA and arrived several hours later in San Luis Obispo. When I tried to pick up my luggage in SLO, the clerk at the united counter was the rudest person and of no help. She instructed me to stand by a door and hope someone would help me. It took 20 minutes. A very nice airport employee, arriving for work took pity on me and opened the door that had the luggage.

I have seen actual staff snap at people asking reasonable questions or for help, downright ignoring them while socialising with colleagues, elderly people asking for assistance to be ignored. The best you are treated is someone just doing their job and acting like you dont exist. For example, taking your bag from you at recheck without a word, checking your passport but looking right through you like youre not there without even a hello or smile or even a nod. I had a 5 hour layover and they didnt manage to get my luggage to my next flight on Time. Its such a sad, sad state.

When we were going through security the rude arrogant lady opened every single present my children received for Christmas, opening up the toys with a screwdriver. They do this for phones, iPads, Nintendo switch! Why would they do it for a Harry Potter wand and a Star Wars droid, that I wouldnt be surprised if it even works now, never been used! Why cant the X-ray scanner see if there is anything inside it like all other luggage! My son was upset seeing her pull apart his droid which seemed to spur her on in her arrogance and self importance! My daughter who wears an arm brace for her recently operated on elbow gets patted down at each airport, not at JFK, they seem to think 3 different people should pat her down, then they stood there and argued about who is more important and who shouldve done it first! The arrogant self important lady who took a screwdriver to my sons toy, was more upset that she didnt get to do the pat down than anything, taking pleasure in not only treating us and anyone around her with disrespect and contempt, but the staff that she works with as well! It took us 48min alone to just get through security. I respect the process, but it doesnt need to be this unpleasant! After all of this the morons at security let through my sons medication which was 250ml of liquid and a pair of scissors (but thank goodness his Harry Potter wand was scrutinised for hidden things). I only know they let these things through because after missing our flight boarding (the plane was still there and the ramp just shut) we went to LeGuardia airport to wait with 3 children for 5 hours on standby and their security picked them up! But guess what, they just scanned the Star Wars droid and Harry Potter wand like any other airport in the free world.

All of my luggage contents were removed then shoved back into my bags without any findings. Approximately 75% of all passenger bags were inspected without any findings. The security line was so confusing with bags being removed and belongings being removed that people were walking away and leaving their personal belongings at security. In a span of 5 minutes, 3 different TSA agents brought over laptops to the gate agent that people left behind. I also walked away without my laptop then quickly returned to retrieve it.

They promised that the new children's area would be finished by the end of the year. We are travelling again tomorrow, and have just found out that there is still no children's area or place to heat/serve food. To me it seems completely unbelievable that such a major airport can offer no facilities at all to families with young children for such a long period of time. For the many families travelling through it must be a very stressful experience, and I know that I myself am dreading having to spend a few hours at the airport with an active 3-year-old.

If you are not a US citizen, do not, I repeat, do not make a transit at this airport, you will not make it in time. Of the 6 times, I've arrived here internationally, it took an average of 1.5 hours just to clear the immigration checkpoint each time, with a maximum of 3 hours from personal experience. After clearing customs, all other airports that I've been to have your checked luggage up and out on the carousel in 20 minutes max. Here, it's at least an hour's wait so it doesn't even matter if you've cleared the immigration checkpoint quickly. Finally when you exit to ground transport, do not use the bag conveyor belt to deliver your luggage separately before taking the transit train to Seattle exit and ground transportation else you'll have to wait another 10 minutes for your bags to arrive by the conveyor belt after you've arrived by the transit train. This airport is not just understaffed, it suffers from very visible underemployment and operation inefficiencies. For example, the airport management has in their infinite wisdom decided to station not one but two workers at each luggage carousel to arrange bags neatly on the carousel as they arrive by the conveyor belt so that they don't tip over. This task is absolutely pointless - I've still seen bags tip over and being rearranged by other passengers standing beside it. So now you have two persons being paid to just stand by the carousel chit-chatting and occasionally moving a bag or two when they could be doing something more useful like delivering the bags quickly. All in all, too much waiting and a poor experience every single time. Is it too much to ask for an airport to do its job quickly so I don't have to stand for another 3 hours after a 12-hour transpacific flight?

This is a ridiculous and appalling standard for what is meant to be one of the biggest international airports in the USA. I know the reason is that they're building a train but this should have been done years ago and having your customers walk for 30 minutes with their bags or risk missing their flights is not an option. They have largely solved the Arrivals traffic issue by having the rideshare cars now pick up at LAX-it - why not do the same for the Departures?

The shops are a basic high street selection. What a missed opportunity. If this was an advert for Manchester you would skip a visit. The security area (unless you pay) is in a dingy basement and painfully slow. Want a luggage trolley? You pay for that. Want wifi for a little longer? You pay for that. Want to get picked up? You pay for that. Until recently, they even charged for those little security bags. Money-grabbing. Passport control, if you hit it at the wrong time, is woefully under staffed and the electronic gates seem like first gen. Even the layout is adhoc, you will be climbing and descending stairs trying to get to your gate. There is really no need for it. It handles around 27m passengers, less than Copenhagen which is far superior. If you can go somewhere else, do so."

This process was badly organized and even worse staffed. Less than half the CBP posts were manned resulting in roughly 25 percent of all passengers missing their flights due to delays in screening. For most screening took 1 hour and 31 minutes in marked contrast to the clearance procedures which argue for procedures of less than 15 minutes. Dozens of passengers failed to fly on their plane due excessive delays where the screening and CPB lanes in terminal A averaged a minimum of 1 and 1/2 hours to get passengers through to their departure plane. Meanwhile, in the same airport, the Canadian CBP perform these exact same checks on people travelling in Canada. The average time to clear their process this week was only 4 minutes and 11 seconds. Strong praise should go to the Canadians, for performing this task 22 and 1/2 times better than their American Counterparts. Unless or until the American CBP can process a like number of persons as the Canadians do and do with a lower error rate, then the US personnel should be fired and replaced with Canadians who will swear an oath to the U.S, to accomplish these tasks."

I semi-joke that one has to transit through DFW to get to either Heaven or Hell, as one can easily see all walks of life represented in the customers in this airport. Heck, I even saw Trace Adkins (American country music star) standing around one time. But honestly, DFW is a great and frustrating airport simultaneously, I like it, but I neither love nor hate it. Despite its size, the terminals are all very well connected by a very modern tram, and are very modern and clean, yet each terminal feels like it's the size of the City of Fort Worth and often requires much walking once in the terminal. For another catch, the personnel in this airport lean toward the friendly side overall, but you never know if you're going to catch that one airline staff member who just enjoys barking at their customers (I'm looking at you, American Airlines!), or that one TSA officer who can't get over their breakup with their significant other last month. Personnel are either very helpful, or have the worst attitudes, and there isn't a lot of in-between. Aesthetically, this airport provides a beautiful, spacious, ""Texas-sized"" introduction to visitors to Dallas, Fort Worth, Texas, and the USA altogether. However, while signage anywhere you need to go within the terminals and around the airport property is ample, it can still be a chore to finally reach the always-slow baggage claim, then the car rental facility, or light rail (again, because of those long tram rides and long walks to anywhere). Lastly, as this airport is in the Dallas area, there's usually either a pushy nouveau-riche soccer mom or a testosterone-fueled redneck who doesn't travel much, who is impatiently trying to push ahead of other people in the airport, whether to order a burger, check a bag, or get on the plane. Something about Dallas, I tell you. This airport does much to make you go, ""Wow!"", before rendering you with such a mixed reaction."

He completely emptied my bag opened my medicine bag and removed all my medication, reading each label and was shaking it about. When I told him my medication was personal. He told me medication had to be declared as part of the liquids bag which is untrue. He then held me up for 20 mins as he swapped by bag 3 times!

Somewhere between Calgary and Vancouver, I lost or had my passport stolen and was unable to board my flight to Auckland with my family. The staff were persistent in helping me in my near panicked state to search my bags while the aircraft was being readied for flight. Unable to produce a passport, the staff sympathetically ushered me to a place in the airport where I met a family member. When I returned to the airport the next day after miraculously acquiring a new passport, flight and Visas, the friendly staff of Air New Zealand greeted me with the same warmth and compassion I had experienced the night before. They informed me that I had been bumped up to Business class and was offered access to the VIP lounge in the airport before my flight. Once inside the Lounge and breathing again for the first time in a day, Douglas Siefert, Vancouver Airport Operations Manager came to the lounge to personally greet me and ensure I was aware of the many luxuries including fabulous food and drinks that I was free to take advantage of. When boarding the flight, the staff once again were kind and genuine, having recognized how overwhelmed I had been the night before watching my family depart on the flight which I could not depart on. I just want to say thank you to the team who so kindly helped me. That was my first experience in Business class and what a way to start my vacation! This was a long awaited holiday where my son, wife and their 8 month old were travelling with me to Australia for my other sons graduation from medical school and then onto New Zealand for Christmas. Having lost my husband in the summer of 2018, this was going to be a very special time with my boys and their wives and families. You can imagine how I would have felt when I couldn't board the flight which was the beginning of this vacation! The staff did not know my story yet were kind, helpful and accommodating. This is a story I will tell over and over as their kindness (which seems to be rarer and rarer these days), made such an impact on me and the experience In Business class was like none other. It goes to show that simple acts of kindness will always be appreciated. We dont often know what someone else is going through so in the words of another be kind to each other! Thank you again Air New Zealand!"

He just sat them on the ground next to him and moved like a slug doing I dont know what. The airport is giant and you cant see the TSA PreCheck from the regular security check line. So I asked a lady, she pointed and said, Over there. Ok, short and to the point. We went to find where over there was. Found the TSA PreCheck line but it didnt display our gate # overhead. So I asked if it was the line for TSA PreCheck to our gate because it didnt list our gate number. She just said, Do you see the TSA PreCheck sign? I was so shocked by the tone and response I paused for a moment and said, I dont see our gate listed. She said, 'You walk around'. Everyone in our party was taken aback and told her there was no need for the attitude, just a simple question. She just continued to be snippy. We rushed past in a hurry to get through.

As an older person who has stopped running marathons years ago, T2 is by far the most unusable airport in the world for people who are not ""disabled"" but have some mobility issues. I understand the theory of having to wind your way through duty free after the undermanned under resourced security area and the miles of cattle fencing for check-in. I was told off for not using it even when it was empty. (we are forced to check in mega early for these reasons). We wont mention the bars full of drunks first thing in a morning. After leaving the Aspire or Escape lounges which themselves are pretty poor compared to the rest of the world. The walk to the gates is several hundred yards at least, too much for families and the elderly and as yet the walkway has never been working. (its only short anyway) I have been there when the lifts were not working either. So unless you set off to the gate the instant is shows on the screens you will be late and incur the wrath of rude ground staff. The sit down on the aircraft is most welcomed IF you don't have to wind round steps and up steps to the aircraft. This is too much for some people and very definitely a security risk, that is another story. Don't mention special assistance, it takes forever, no staff, no chairs, wrong size etc, etc. plus it precludes you from having an extra legroom seat, and we are the people in most need of the legroom. Coming back is something to be feared, it is over 1 kilometer from the gate to the pick-up point and even for able bodied people dragging cases and children is a very long way. Landed at 14.05 today and it was over 1 hour 40 minutes before we were on our way and most of that was walking, blistered feet exhausted. It is an extra 30 minutes by car to Liverpool for us so we would have been home before we even left Manchester airport.

We weren't thrilled at the prospect, having avoided Manchester for some years now on the basis of its size and overcrowding. In the event, things were much better than expected, mainly because both flights were at quiet times of day. Passage through security took only a few minutes and, though both of us had our hand luggage selected for separate inspection, the security staff were very pleasant and in no way officious. On our return, we were quickly through the electronic passport gates and actually back to our car in JetPark 1 within 20 minutes or so of landing. So, as far as the basic function of transit from car park to plane and back again was concerned, we had no problems at all. I would still say, however, that Manchester airport is somewhere I would prefer to avoid: some of the signage is confusing, many of the seats in the main central area of Terminal One were ripped and in need of replacement and the route from plane to terminal exit seemed to involve several staircases up or down. The sight of the extensive chicanes at security and passport control, not in use when we transited, was also a clear indication of what the airport must be like at peak times. As for finding one's way around the exterior of the airport, I can only be glad that all we needed was to access JetPark 1 and let the transfer bus drivers do the rest!

In all the chaos, we lost one of our boarding passes, so we had to rush to the ticket counter to get a new one printed. She insisted on reprinting all 3 passes even though we only needed 1. After that was done, we started to run to the next step when my wife checked and saw they printed the wrong name on my boarding pass. We decided to just use the old one since it didn't need to be reprinted anyway. It was like she was deliberately wasting our time when we had none to waste. We ran to the tent outside (by the way, we weren't dressed for cold weather because we had no plans to leave the airport so my 7-year-old was freezing right along with us) where we were told to wait for the bus. There were so many people that we had to wait for the next one. We knew we had to go to terminal 1, but when the driver stopped, he never said anything. He just opened the door. Now, I could assume that the first stop is terminal 1, but I hate to make assumptions and get off the bus at the wrong terminal when we're already pressed for time.Luckily, someone else said they could see a ""1"" outside, so we got off and ran. We made it to our flight while they were almost finished boarding. 2 hours should have been enough time to get through, but it almost wasn't. Complete chaos, inefficiency and lack of knowledge at O'Hare. Can't rate some things because we had no time to use them."

Had no problem with immigration and other usual formalities of arrival. We were shocked when we proceeded to collect our baggage. The baggage area was awful with the smell of fish. We thought we were in a fish market. We have never experienced such conditions at any airport in our over fifty years of travelling. Secondly, the baggage handling staff was in a state of panic. The supervisor was literally shouting at the passengers who were waiting for their baggage. The Airport needs to clean up the baggage area of Terminal 3 and the staff, for sure, needs better training in dealing with the passengers. Next time we are at Pearson, we hope to see an improved baggage area and staff more respectful in dealing with the passengers."

We spent 4 hours sitting on the floor of the airport, along with over 100+ other travelers, before the Southwest Airlines representative would allow us to even check our luggage. The sign in the airport clearly stated that Baggage May be checked up to 4 hours prior to departure, yet we were shunned away and told we had to wait until 2 hours prior to departure. So you had a room filled with people sitting on the floor with their luggage because we were being told we could not check luggage until 2 hrs prior to departure when signs posted clearly stated the rule was 4 hrs before departure.

After a lovely holiday we had to cart 4 cases to the west point for our taxi. We are in our 70s and our backs were sore by the time we got there, it spoilt our holiday. The queue was long and taxis all over the place, we spent nearly 2 hours in this airport, I booked good flights we only live 30 mins from the airport and we did not get home until 10.45.

After immigration, customs and rechecking you baggage you will have to leave the international terminal and go to another terminal. This means you are basically out in the street and you'll have to reenter the airport. Directions to the other terminal are poor and it is a long walk. When you arrive at the other terminal you will have to go through security with all other passengers entering the terminal, which can take a long time. The whole transfer from international to domestic can take a long time and is not comfortable. The Domestic terminal does not offer a lot of choice in shops, food and beverages."

When we finally got to the barriers there were 4 lanes that all had to turn left to get in with no dedicated lanes we had to edge in bumper to bumper and side of car to side of car so close there was beeping/shouting and we could hear arguments at the barriers to get out too. You drive all the way round on the ground level to the disabled bays where are friends have to wait as they are disabled. Cars where trying to back out to exit and had nowhere to go as we where all coming in, they were forcing there way out because of the charges and time limits and even unconcerned about pedestrians with cases and children trying to find there taxis or lifts. We could not park our poor friends had to jump in the car as we gradually moved along, then we too had to queue to get out. It took longer to get in/out of this awful car park than it did for our friends to get off the plane collect their cases and get through security. The worst airport in the world and we've been to many. This system is not working, and wont work even when it's finished, its mainly due to the greedy airport owners, something needs to be done NOW but of course that won't happen until someone is killed in that airport car park. From What I saw tonight I'm afraid that wont be long. If you have a choice go to another airport. Ps. we flew into Manchester Terminal 2 on 3rd January after being away for new year, please be aware if you have mobility problems it's a 1 kilometer walk from the gate to security far to far away."

The garages and drives and signage are not any better than third world airports. Think Orlando, Chicago and Miami airport landscaping and signage - all beautifully designed and maintained- not New Orleans - no design talent anywhere outside of the terminal - a waste of a billion dollars! The biggest problem with this 10 week old terminal is that it is filthy - I have been through the airport 4 times since it opened in November and I can attest that the floors have not ben cleaned once since opening. The same stains and dirt piles are on the floors. They have been swept clean by the lazy airport staff, but never washed clean. What a shame after the efforts put into the design and great layout. Atlanta and Detroit airports are all run by similar politically connected vendors- but they are spotlessly clean and beautiful. The New Orleans folks just dont care about being clean - what a shame. Maybe the mayor is a slob and doesnt know what clean is - because if she ever traveled anywhere else - she would understand that you need to clean floors every door when millions walk in them.

Before at least you could chill out with a smoke before your flight and/or get a smoke in between flights - helped with the mental stress of flying! Not having that break in between made my travel day horrible!

The facilities are old and tatty, the staff are rude and uncaring and the security staff have no consistency in the way they manage. Over the past 10 years I have seen a gradual and steady decline in standards. The Manchester Airport Group (MAG) have recently introduced pickup and drop off charges. They will not doubt defend that decision as helping to reduce vehicle traffic, or even under the banner of some environmental initiative. Well, I dont believe them. This in my opinion is yet another cynical attempt to extract more money from travellers. Will it help to fund improvements in infrastructure or improve passenger experience? I dont think so. I think it will just help to improve the annual bonus of executives. For many of us there is no option and we have to use Manchester Airport. But, if there is any other option I will always take it."

The Berry Bistro is the only option on the Southwest terminal side to get any sort of coffee thats to go other than Starbucks. Starbucks takes over 20 minutes because they are the only ones with reliable options. The Berry Bistro two weeks ago was closed because no staff showed up to work in the am.

When we asked for a refund they couldnt because they didnt have a manager to approve so they had to get change out of their wallets to refund us. All the other food options in the court area have cold food, even in the warmers, the staff cant speak English. If your going to expand this airport you need to massively step it up with a manager that can oversee these places and hire people that care to be working for the day not texting on their phones at the register. This airport is WAY behind the eight ball, compared to other similar markets around the country ie., Charlotte, Orlando, West Palm, St Louis.

Some of these children had been on our flight, which was over 11 hours long. Any request such as changing a babies nappy was met with an annoyed response from staff.

There is no logical connectivity between the terminals, whether you're relying on signage or the inter-terminal tram. I mean, isn't the purpose of a tram to logically piece the airport together? The floors don't look like they've been cleaned since 1987. The restrooms, unkempt sometimes.

And then the customs queue again was one single queue (All visa types, all transiting passengers). I missed my connecting flight and had to wait 6 hours for the next flight. Had even one officer said, your Visa goes directly to the customs queue or if there was clear signage, it would have saved 6 hours of my life! Safe to say, for a passenger the airport staff is the first contact with the country. And LAX is failing miserably at representing the USA. If someone from the airport is reading this review, you only need the following queues at immigration: 1) US and Canadian citizens --> Use the dedicated mobile passport area (no queuing required) 2) One queue for Transit cardholders (to a country outside the US) 3) One queue for connecting flight (within the US) boarding pass holders 4) One queue for people actually immigrating It will only make passengers but also your life easier. One thing is for sure, I'm not transiting from LAX ever again."

I was flying to Vancouver on February 1/20, flight 1789 and had misplaced my passport. When I called the airline directly I was informed that a Passport was required to board the aircraft. I had cleared Security and was already checked in for boarding. The agent at the WestJet Departure Lounge was so helpful and patient. He took my information and identification and called the airline. I did have a copy of my passport with me, which was verified. After 15 minutes I was told I could board the plane to Vancouver and then on to the connecting flight to Kelowna, B.C. I cannot tell you what relief and good news that was. I cannot say enough about the service and handling of this situation by the agent that assisted me."

On arrival (6:30 a.m.) there were no queues, passport scanners worked fine, and our priority bags were in the first 10 or so to be delivered from the A380.

The Departures sign board indicated the gate as D 9 (if memory serves), so we quickly followed the signs towards corridor D. But guess what, even though one hallway was clearly marked with a D (and an arrow) it had a barrier across the entrance and a big floor sign: No Admittance. So back we went to the main corridor, where we saw directional arrows for Gates D-E etc, so down that corridor we race, looking for an American Rebooking desk. None in sight, anywhere, despite this being a major American hub. Stopped at one gate that was staffed and asked where the rebooking desk was, and was told it was something like D-37 or D-3, and then the agent volunteered that one might be a little closer, so off in that direction we ran. When we finally got there, we were told that the doors had already been closed (never mind that it would have been about a 15 minute walk to get there anyway). So we resigned ourselves to an interminable wait down near D-1, where a bottled beer was ""only"" $10.50, not counting tax and a ""suggested tip of $1.50."" When it finally was near time for the departure for the later flight, suddenly there was a flurry of activity at the adjacent gates, when apparently four American flights were to depart within 15 minutes of one another from gates D-1 to D-5. And since there seemed to be only one PA, the assembled passengers became understandably restless when the gate attendant announced ""we are now boarding Groups 1 and 2"" without bothering to state the destination or flight number. Confusing? You bet. Especially when said announcement was drowned out by another PA telling ""passenger XXX, please report to the gate."" Final boarding began when five wheelchairs were rolled to the plane, followed very quickly by anyone who simply showed his/her boarding pass and walked aboard. There was only one American gate agent on duty, apparently all the others were still dealing with the adjacent flights. Not professional at all."

He did exactly the same thing as we had already done and took yet another photo but, this time taking fingerprints of both hands. What an absolute joke this airport is. The rudeness of one of the officials astounded us. He must have been an ex serviceman or police officer in a former life. He was aggressive and treated everybody as if they were 10 years old.

Unfortunately, it can be difficult to leave the airport on public transit on the weekend because NJ Transit schedules 3 trains within 15 minutes of each other, then makes you wait 45 minutes for the next one. For that reason, I reluctantly shelled out for a Lyft into New York. I really appreciated that Newark lets you get into Lyft vehicles directly at the curbside - too many airports these days make you walk long distances to a distant parking garage to get your ride, but Newark's customer-friendly decision to let me get picked up at the curb meant that I could be on my way within 10 minutes of arriving, for which I give them high marks. Departing out of Terminal C was a little more hectic, the signage for how to get to security from the check-in desks was inadequate, and the employees who were supposed to be directing traffic were rude when asked for assistance. The food in Terminal C was overpriced, but I thought the quality was actually decent, and I liked the ability to order food on a tablet at the gate and get it delivered. Newark isn't great, and I wish the public transit powers that be would spread the trains out a little more so that there aren't 45 minutes wait for trains.

That means you are stuck with limited services unless you want to go through the TSA line again. And what great services are available! Small one-holer bathrooms with 1970s designs that are dirty and smell, too few to accommodate everyone which causes long lines even in the mensroom. Restaurants that close at 7PM when my connecting flight does not depart until 8:25pm. Not enough chairs for everyone to sit. Ancient airline displays with plastic cards vs. modern terminals. I've been to third world countries with airports that are much better! I'll never layover here on a trip again. Southwest, you should be both ashamed & embarrassed that you call this airport a hub!

Once inside I noticed there were only a few restrooms (2 per terminal), all with very long lines (on a Tuesday mid-morning). Gate seating areas were ridiculously undersized for number of passengers on a plane. There was seating for about 50 with the gates directly next to us both filled with their own passengers so people just sat on the floor in the walkways. Not safe! If they intended for overflow to go into next gate they have to plan for that in staggering schedules. Overall I really don't understand why they built this. It is undersized for current needs with no room for growth in the industry. The trend is more people traveling and they seem to be expecting the opposite. Pretty much frustrated with poor scaling the entire morning. We are told to get there with much time to spare (by TSA) but there is no where to go. I will avoid this airport whenever possible.

She opened her hand and spread out the bills counting them in front of everyone. Shame on FLL! This should never happen at a US airport.

The lines were really really long in security and customs. The signage is non-existent in security, customs and in ticketing. Pretty bad for an international airport. Just disappointed."

There is a tram connecting parts of the half dozen concourses but you need to be at the correct place to board it. In any case, be prepared to give quite a bit of time to make to your connecting gate. The food outlets are not evenly spaced out which also means quite a bit of going to and fro in search of a bite.

Each time someone would take my bag and walk very very slowly to the other end of the room and put it at the back of the line . So now it was something in my bag and not the iPad. By the 4th time they decided to check my bag. But the security woman was nasty towards me for showing signs of stress. I had been there for at least 40 min. Apparently I looked at my watch - I was told to stop doing that and to Calm down. She then proceeded to aggressively lecture me. I just said that if I had been informed at the beginning about the iPad all of this could be avoided. Never ever say anything. Lesson learned. Most airports Ive been through dont require iPads to be taken out."

I mean what is the purpose of having the app. Then they put us on a line, and the officer did not accept mobile passport, so we were sent to another line. They need to have a better system for this, they are aware that several flights come in at the same time, it is not new to them. This is the second time this happens, and I heard a lot of people saying that mostly everyone misses their connecting flights due to customs.

Anything you bought at your last airport, duty free, any liquids will be thrown out. Again zero signage giving you a heads up that you might want to check anything you've bought while stuck at your last airports. So heads up, this airport is terrible.

In addition to hiking a mile, you have to leave Security and go through it all again at the mile-away next terminal. Thats absurd.

No direct connections for international passengers transiting thru. Waste of money and intelligence really. Tsa agent took my 100 ml Jam as they dont understand its less than 3 ounces. World uses metric, come on Denver, get educated. I gave it up. Tsa agent dished me from the tsa line as one of my boarding passes said tsa approved and the other didnt have the stamp. So, sent me to the end of the other line. She knew I had 15 min. Another volunteer staff, assisted me and brought me thru to the front of the line. Those who have nexus, global entry should already be pre tsa approved. This is an airport I will purposely avoid. I ran past 50 gates, no assistance from tsa or United and missed the flight by 5 min.

Funny how we had no problem with it going through security for our previous flight a few hours earlier. 4 of your TSA workers thought it was a big joke that we were going to miss our flight because no one was there to check bags that had been set aside and were having a great time laughing and joking instead of actually working. Loved how our suitcase was manhandled when finally checked, and when we arrived at our destination after two flights, driving, being up all day and helping family pack up their belongings in preparing to move in the morning, our bed which we planned to sleep on tonight wont hold air.

If so, TSA should announce it, so people can decide to buy CLEAR instead of PreCheck. I believe the CLEAR machines and staff should be placed at the end of PreCheck line or a separate area away from the PreCheck line, so when they are confirmed CLEAR, they can get in PreCheck line like all the other PreCheck customers.

We waited half an hour for the same agent to ransack the bags of a family of four, and then it was our turn, other passengers still waiting. Supervisor, not much help either.

Another member of staff picked up the tray from the middle of the rapidly-filling conveyor and returned it to be put through the scanner again. This time the tray and contents were ok to be collected. All the time this was happening, two customer interviewers were completing interviews on their tablets themselves, without referring to customers. There were also Union people milling around with clipboards. It was complete chaos, with disgruntled customers hanging around waiting for their trays and the staff not doing their jobs. When one customer stated that no other airport in the UK goes through such measures, he was told ""no other airport cares about your security""."
2020-03-13,2020-03-13,2.0,"""MIA is just not acceptable""","  | Landed home to the USA after 10 hour flight in from Europe because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Yes, I admit the stress and concerns of social distancing is high but my airport observations despite the travel tensions are true. Kudos to the information booth attendant in terminal 1. However, brace yourselves for the lax unprofessional TSA team. Only once before, serving jury duty, had I ever felt like I was being processed for incarceration - like a bad movie scene. I flew into MIA once before 11 years ago and it was bad. It's worse. I only flew in to avoid JFK but MIA is just not acceptable."
2020-03-13,2020-03-13,3.0,""" No training on how to clean"""," |  Poor signage. Everyone shows up to south security. The other two security check points almost empty. Bathrooms look worse than a truck stop. Cleaning staff, used towel to clean toilet no sanitizer, used same towel to clean sink, mirror, shelf, towel dispenser! No training on how to clean! Most people leaving bathroom with out washing hands! No wonder why everyone getting sick!"
2020-03-13,2020-03-13,1.0,"""the gate was filthy and rundown""",  | My family and I were at gate L5 at Spirit this morning. There was a mouse running around as the gate was filthy and rundown. We reported the mouse and were told by gate agent that it was fine and it would not hurt us. He proceeded to do nothing. I will never fly out of here again.
2020-03-13,2020-03-13,1.0,"""Worst experience ever""", |  Worst experience ever. I had a long lay over and wanted to go to a lounge in a different concourse but was unable too. Every time you go to a different concourse you have to go back through security if they let you. They prescribe your tickets and if you are set for a different concourse they block you. I will never go through here again.
2020-03-14,2020-03-14,1.0,"""Avoid this airport like the plague"""," |  Complete dump. Falling apart, stinks, and the workers are absolutely incompetent. Avoid this airport like the plague. Makes me never want to fly again"
2020-03-14,2020-03-14,1.0,"""Avoid this place like the plague"""," |  The airport security team is the most horrid experience in all my travels. You literally have to take almost everything out of your bags. Anything with a cord, any liquid, all electronics. Oh and boots off but not any other shoe. So bizarre. We had like 12 bins with all our stuff taken out and a tiny area for everyone to repack. The security ladies are snarky and absolutely rude! If I can avoid this airport in the future I will at all costs. I made a comment to my husband how inefficient this security process was. Well big mistake because one of the ladies heard me and proceeded to rip me a new one for 5 minutes in front of my children. I even told her to stop talking to me like that in front of my kids and she said she is concerned with my behavior and what I will be like on the plane if Im told something I dont like. Really lady! Get a life. Never ever had this experience. Avoid this place like the plague if you can. I am mortified with the way they treat people."
