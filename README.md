# MSCL_Project
Final project for MS in Comp Ling
This project used VADER Sentiment Analysis and LDA Topic Modeling to quantify the change in people's opinions on air travel during the COVID-19 pandemic and to observe the areas of concern air travelers have. We found that air travels' perceptions of flying have become increasingly more negative since the start of the pandemic and that areas of concern such as "mask wearing" and "covid policies" have emerged.
